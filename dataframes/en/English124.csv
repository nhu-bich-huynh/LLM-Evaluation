"However, on the last point, I feel it is important that when the European Union is considering how to distribute the financial burden deriving from its future international climate funding commitments, it will take into account individual Member States' economic potential and the limits of their productive capacity."
"I also believe that every European citizen must participate in the battle against climate change, and comprehensive energy-saving campaigns are required to achieve this."
"It is already clear to us nowadays that among the dangers threatening the Earth, the biggest predicament by far is caused by greenhouse gases, primarily the emission of carbon dioxide."
"While this may currently seem in ruling political circles to be an ideological debate, this issue defines the limits for economic opportunities and development, determining future investment in these areas."
"When we talk in the European Parliament about climate change and preparations for the Copenhagen conference, we must not forget that our approval of the energy and climate package laid the foundations for a European energy policy that favours not only increasing competitiveness and strengthening supply security, but also energy efficiency, environmentally-friendly energy production and the assertion of consumer interests."
"The third energy package created the opportunity from a market perspective, and the climate package from a regulatory perspective, for newer investors and operators to enter the European energy market."
"This is the key to Europe's climate change policy and its Copenhagen objectives."
"We need new investment in energy, new innovative technologies and new operators."
"After all, we can only achieve a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions both at a European and global level if we develop and implement new technologies."
"The European decisions made recently facilitate this."
"We must progress further along this road."
"Achieving an agreement in Copenhagen will give the necessary impetus for coordination at global level of the actions to be taken against climate change."
"The climate crisis must be inextricably linked to the economic crisis."
"This provides an opportunity to move from an unsustainable economy based on limited natural resources to a sustainable one."
"In addition to promoting the strategy for energy supply security and energy efficiency, Europe must devise a plan for investing in new energy technologies."
"The promotion of green technologies at Community level does not only involve finding an alternative solution to the energy crisis, but also boosting economic growth and creating new jobs."
"On the other hand, reaching agreement in Copenhagen offers an opportunity to promote the future links between the EU's system for trading emission allowances and the regional or federal trading systems in the US and other countries which operate this kind of system or similar systems."
"Last but not least, the EU must adopt a uniform position for maintaining its leading role in negotiations."
"It must also be actively involved in strengthening existing partnerships in the climate sector with developing countries, as well as in establishing new partnerships where they do not yet exist."
"A month and a half before the summit in Copenhagen, and in view of unavoidable climate change, the world expects us to take specific action - action which demonstrates responsibility and careful thought in relation to working together on behalf of people and their safety."
"We are all familiar with the reports of the International Panel on Climate Change, which clearly state that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is the result of human activity."
"Climate issues have become the geopolitical and economic priority of the 21st century, a priority which requires decisions that are both bold and based on long-term measures."
"To achieve world consensus, it is necessary to define climate treaties which will build new models for the reduction of greenhouse gases after 2012."
"The Kyoto Protocol was the first step to changing the mentality of world governments on the question of environmental protection."
"We should continue with this way of thinking."
"The point is, however, that we cannot confine ourselves to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of developed countries such as the USA and China."
"It is essential to support smaller, poorer countries, which have problems with the introduction of alternative, green energy sources."
"This is not only a matter of financial support, but also of education and sharing experience in the creation of green economies."
"When making decisions, we should also think of the citizens."
"We should inform and educate them, and persuade them to invest in protecting the environment."
"As with every political measure in the area of safety, the support and cooperation of the citizens is indispensable."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, new results from research into the progress of climate change are obtained daily, and they suggest that the change is advancing all the time, and faster than was previously predicted."
"If we are to preserve the earth in the state that life here has adapted to, we will have to establish a carbon-neutral economy by the year 2050."
"In the light of these studies, the EU's climate targets cannot be called too ambitious."
"Everyone knows how serious the problem is."
"Nevertheless, time is still spent debating whether we are a hundred per cent certain that humans are causing climate change or not."
"This unwillingness to take the right action is incomprehensible, especially as, for a long time now, we have known how to implement change and we have been familiar with the technologies required to do so, at the same time improving the quality of life using new technology."
"There is a psychological explanation for this inertia."
"Some of our behavioural models are doggedly opposed to change, while the rest only change slowly."
"The only problem is that we have no time left."
"One of the biggest issues at the end of this year is the EU's readiness to work with determination to ensure that the agreement reached at Copenhagen measures up to the climate challenge."
"The Union must clearly commit to a 30% cut in emissions by 2020 and an 80% cut by 2050."
"Part of the agreement will be a credible promise given by the EU to help the developing countries with information and technology transfers and adequate sums of money in assistance."
"in writing. - (RO) Over the next 50 years, climate change will have a significant impact on important economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, ecosystems, tourism and health."
"Climate change will also affect households, companies and certain sections of society, especially the elderly, people with disabilities and low income families."
"The EU is determined to take prompt action to cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"However, it is not enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate the impact of climate change."
"Additional action is required to alleviate this problem in the short term."
"The effects of climate change are expected to be more significant than was envisaged and they will appear, regardless of the measures implemented to alleviate them."
"Consequently, measures are required to strengthen the resistance of natural and human systems in standing up to the impact of climate change, in other words, adaptation policies."
"These policies are being applied in the EU, but policies are also required at a global level."
"This is why the Copenhagen conference must be an international success."
"We need to have a global solidarity pact for developing green economies by promoting certain clean technologies which will guarantee jobs, as well as protect the environment and the population's health."
"The EU is a world leader in the fight against climate change."
"This position clearly gives us a responsibility to help the developing countries."
"When we provide assistance, we must be responsible to a high degree for its consequences."
"If developing countries are to be given EUR 30 billion a year for their efforts to alleviate the effects of climate change, then the aim of this measure must be climate justice and solidarity."
"We cannot permit an aim or an outcome that would ignite new tension through new distortions in social and political development."
"The links between developing countries and the developed world are complex."
"When handing over resources, we need to look at all of the potential impacts of the development aid, including political and population-related consequences."
"The greatest proportion of the resources should be targeted on supporting education and the information society."
"Even in the European Parliament, not everyone is convinced that climate change is a real threat."
"If there is no understanding of the reality of climate change and its consequences in the target countries, our assistance will amount to nothing more than a bribe paid out for our prosperity to the governments of those countries whose inhabitants lack such prosperity."
"If the ambitious goals of the EU are not appropriately reflected by the other major parties - the USA, China, India and the countries of South and Central America - it will be necessary for the EU to concentrate on strengthening its internal adaptation measures and mechanisms, especially in relation to the health and security of EU inhabitants."
"in writing. - The negotiations in Copenhagen on financing to developing countries will be crucial if this summit is to be successful."
"Already, some African countries have said they will not be able to commit to the kind of deal we need at Copenhagen if it does not contain suitable measures for financing of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries."
"There are two key points here - the first is that the public money given to these developing countries must be new, additional money and should not come from existing aid budgets."
"The second point is that it is not just public money which can be used in this context; in addition to providing aid directly, steps can be taken to encourage private sector investment in low-carbon economies."
"The extent to which the private sector is prepared to invest in developing countries will depend on international agreements on Emission Trading Schemes."
"Agreements on this issue will provide the policy coherence and stability which give the private sector the confidence to invest properly in developing countries."
"The negotiations must therefore aim for both comprehensive commitments regarding public financing and concrete measures to secure private sector investment."

"Mr President, yesterday, my colleague, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Barrot, stressed that the aim of the proposals is to communitise the evaluation mechanism and to make it more effective, while maintaining mutual confidence among the Member States."
"The Commission is convinced that Parliament should be involved in the Schengen evaluation, which is not the case at present."
"The citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations."
"However, in accordance with the treaties in force, it is not possible to involve Parliament by way of codecision."
"The Commission therefore stands by its proposals on the basis of the treaties in force."
"Nevertheless, once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the matter will be reopened and the Commission will decide, when the time comes, what it considers to be the most appropriate legal basis for the proposed mechanism, and will involve the European Parliament as fully as possible."
"The Commission could therefore submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation."
"I appreciate the clarifications given by the European Commission, but would like to remind the House that, as was made clear during the debate, although the Legal Service of the European Parliament recognised the legitimacy of the legal basis of the Commission's initiative, it also said that, based on the Treaty in force, the European Commission could have taken the same initiative based on a legal formula according the European Parliament the power of codecision."
"As this was not the case, I propose that the initiative should be returned to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs so that the Commission can rethink its initiative."
"Then, within the term set out in Rule 56 of our Rules of Procedure, we in Parliament can expect to receive an initiative from the Commission that respects codecision and gives this European Parliament the power it deserves to intervene in upholding greater security within the Schengen Area."

"(For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of the reports on The Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles."
"In these reports, I like the elements of overcoming the bureaucratic processes of agreements, freedom of movement of citizens and the reciprocal nature that all of these actions must have."
"However, with the utmost respect for all of these sovereign countries that are our friends, I would like to take advantage of the good relationships that are demonstrated by these agreements to help all of these countries which, I repeat, are sovereign and our friends, to immunise themselves against a pandemic that is even more deadly than the flu: tax havens."
"This has already been debated in the G20 and many other forums."
"Tax havens have contributed very significantly and unfortunately to the economic crisis that we are experiencing."
"Something is being done, perhaps not much yet, to eradicate the most active tax havens, but let us not be naïve."
"Others could start up."
"In Spain, the Gürtel case is in the news: not only a huge network of corruption but also one of flight of capital."
"Therefore, representatives of the Commission and the Council, let us take advantage of these agreements to insist on this immunisation which we have to demand sooner or later in order to have a broader and more radical policy against tax havens."
"(PL) Mr President, the Schengen Treaty resulted in a qualitative change across the territory of the majority of countries in the European Union."
"Even though such a short time has passed since it came into force, we often forget what Europe was like when it had borders and the difficulties associated with moving from one Member State to another."
"The Schengen agreement is another success of our integration but it also bears a great responsibility."
"Responsibility for a significant part of our land borders has been assumed by the new Member States."
"As well as the positive aspects, there are also negative ones, because excessive restrictions have been introduced on the movement of the residents of countries which share a border with the EU, and this means mainly the new countries, such as Poland and Latvia."
"As a result of these difficulties, there are, among others, serious restrictions on movement across our eastern borders."
"A new division has arisen, a kind of barrier between countries which had and have close relations resulting from a shared history, family connections and, above all, because they are neighbours."
"In accordance with the provisions of Schengen, a common system of internal control has been introduced, and is being applied by the appropriate services in the countries of the European Union which are signatories to the agreement."
"It would appear, however, that this system of control is being applied with undue severity, which does not help to build a positive image of the unity of the European Union."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I fully support the conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) by the European Community."
"This body's main objective is to promote good practices in the renewable energy sector, both within the European Union and globally."
"The agency's Statute stipulates that it will promote and support the use of renewable resources throughout the world."
"The Community's conclusion of the Statute of this agency will enable it to enjoy better, direct access to information about the activities going on in the renewable energy sector, both at European and global level."
"At the same time, its status as a member of the agency will allow it to reinforce the monitoring of the progress being made by Member States towards fulfilling the mandatory renewable energy objective by 2020."
"in writing. - I have voted for this report."
"Currently, there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a European and world scale."
"For this reason, there is a big gap between the countries which have achieved major progress and success in renewable energy and countries which are still lagging behind in this area."
"If we want to accelerate the process of increasing the share of renewable energy sources, different countries should act in a coordinated way and leading countries should share their best practice."
"This agency, I think, would embark upon those goals and would give a new impetus and direction to renewable energy in general."
"I welcome the fact that the European Community is now represented in the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)."
"The International Renewable Energy Agency aims to promote the adoption and the sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy, taking into account their contribution to the conservation of the environment, climate protection, economic growth and social cohesion (especially poverty reduction and sustainable development), the accessibility and security of energy supply, regional development and intergenerational responsibility."
"The agency also aims to provide technical, financial and political advice to the governments of developing countries, thus contributing to their process of transition to a low-carbon society."
"The use of renewable energy is one of the key objectives of the EU's climate and energy package."
"This agency will contribute to implementing the package's objectives, especially the aim of increasing the proportion of renewable energy used to 20% of total energy consumption by 2020."
"in writing. - IRENA was officially established on 26 January 2009."
"The purpose of this organisation is to become the headquarters for promoting a rapid transition towards the use of sustainable energy."
"The Statute of this organisation has been concluded."
"It is vital that this organisation starts to function as quickly as possible."
"I am in favour of the adoption of the Statute that has been presented and, hence, voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I support the conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the European Community."
"The International Renewable Energy Agency aims to become a centre of excellence for renewable energy, which will enable it to help governments harness renewable energy sources, to disseminate know-how and best practice, and to provide training in this field."
"It is thus desirable for the Community to be represented in an institution whose goals coincide with an area of its competence, and whose Statute has already been signed by 20 Member States."
"Portugal is the sixth most energy-dependent country in the EU 27, so investment in 'clean tech' is of prime importance."
"I advocate a national renewable energy plan, with particular emphasis on wind power, wave energy (given the exceptional conditions offered by the Portuguese coast), solar-thermal and photovoltaic energy and microgeneration."
"I am also in favour of researching and developing methods, technologies and strategies for the storage of surplus renewable energy."
"I advocate an energy policy that takes account of economic challenges and social needs, while promoting sustainable development, without generating an environmental cost to be borne by future generations."
"My abiding concern has always been to limit our energy dependence, and I am sure that the way forward is to support and develop renewable energy, so I welcome the fact that Portugal is a founding member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)."
"That is also why I support the European Community's endorsement of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)."
"In voting for this report, I want to emphasise the importance of creating this international organisation which will promote and support the use of renewable resources throughout the world, bearing in mind the benefits which can be derived from their contribution to protecting the environment and climate, economic growth and social cohesion, including reducing poverty, as well as to guaranteeing energy supply security and regional development."
"At the Bonn Conference in January 2009, Romania, which was the first country to sign up, was appointed vice-chair of this first session."
"It was also invited to join IRENA's administrative committee, the core element which is acting temporarily as the Agency's secretariat until it begins to operate properly."
"At the moment, 137 states have signed the Statute, including 24 EU Member States."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation repealing certain obsolete Council acts in the field of the common agricultural policy, as it is necessary to eliminate acts that are no longer relevant from the acquis communautaire in order to improve the transparency and legal certainty of the Community's legislation, in view of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making by the European Parliament, Council and Commission."
"This was recently reaffirmed in the Commission's communication entitled 'A simplified CAP for Europe - a success for all';"
"I am responsible for the European Parliament report on this communication, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"Within the scope of this strategy, therefore, it is worth removing acts that no longer have any real effect from the legislation in force."
"in writing. - Due to the vast quantity of European legislation, it becomes essential that any defunct material is efficiently repealed."
"In view of this, I have voted in favour of this report."
"I believe it is essential that all stakeholders in the common agricultural policy (CAP) should be aware of the legal framework in place and the rules that apply at any particular time."
"I accept that legal certainty requires that obsolete acts do not remain in force indefinitely in the Community's legal system."
"Given the fundamental importance of the CAP for the governments and citizens of the Union, I argue that it should be as simple and clear as possible in terms of its implementation and the rules in force."
"The CAP is central to the life of the Union, is of enormous practical importance, and cannot be a tangle of rules, regulations, acts and decisions that no longer apply, or it will not be effective."
"In view of all the above, I support the Commission's proposal to repeal obsolete acts in the field of the common agricultural policy."
"in writing. - The issue voted on refers to the need of the European Institutions to repeal Council Acts which have, through the passage of time and the development of technology, become obsolete and irrelevant to the correct functioning of the Union."
"This vote refers to certain Council Acts in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"I believe that certain aspects of the CAP have long been in need of review."
"If the policy is to be correctly implemented and used for the benefit of European citizens, the Acts which it has created must be relevant to the world of agriculture as it is today."
"It is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the Union of its red-tape image amongst the people of Europe."
"Acts such as these serve simply to confuse, without serving any real purpose."
"Aspects of EU policy such as this tarnish the image of the Union amongst its citizens and discourage people from interacting with it."
"In conclusion, it is my firm belief that if the Union wishes to remain relevant, then modernisation of its laws and policies must always be voted in favour of."
"It was with great pleasure that I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on a regulation repealing certain obsolete acts in the field of the CAP, because we keep hearing that we have too much regulation in the EU, with negative consequences for the correct functioning of the market economy."
"This is particularly true of the CAP, in which, despite the introduction of many simplifications and the elimination of a host of regulations, many unnecessary acts remain in force."
"Many of these acts no longer produce any legal effects, while the content of others has been embodied in subsequent documents."
"This creates a huge burden of time and cost for our farmers, and requires extensive administration."
"Therefore, I think that further updating, consolidation and simplification of EU law is essential, as is the repeal of a great many unnecessary legal acts, so that the provisions which are in force are simple, clear and understandable."
"This will bring the European Union closer to its citizens."
"I would like to explain my vote on the draft Council Regulation repealing a number of obsolete Council Acts relating to the Common Agricultural Policy."
"During the process of European integration, many acts were passed in the European Parliament and the Council."
"At the time of our accession to the EU, the acquis communautaire numbered almost 80 000 pages of text, half of which related to agriculture."
"It is therefore a good thing that EU bodies have agreed on an interinstitutional basis that Community law must be updated and condensed."
"Laws that have no lasting significance should be eliminated from the acquis communautaire in order to improve the transparency and certainty of Community law."
"The Commission lately declared 250 agricultural laws obsolete."
"We are now talking about 28 acts that have no use from a practical perspective but which still formally exist, and six acts that are obsolete."
"Although I supported this draft, I strongly believe that there are still further opportunities for slimming down European law and cutting back the Brussels bureaucracy and I am therefore asking the Commission to continue its work on the simplification of European law."
"in writing. - Laboratory tests must be carried out in order to identify harmful organisms that are not present within the EU."
"The regulations currently in place do not allow for certain laboratories to which such work can be delegated to take on this work due to the fact that they fall short of Article 2(1)(g)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC."
"I am in favour of allowing such laboratories to conduct this kind of work so long as certain conditions are complied with."
"Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of the report which authorises Portugal to apply reduced rates of excise duty in the Azores and Madeira on locally produced and consumed liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and rum, because I see this as an important way of supporting the subsistence of the small industries in the sector involved in producing such goods, which are in a very unfavourable competitive position, faced with the liberalisation of markets and the growing sales of spirits in these regions."
"The reduction of this tax will also contribute to a greater economic and social balance in these regions, thus ensuring the sustainability and even the creation of jobs, which are crucial for safeguarding the local economies."
"in writing. - The Government of Malta should follow similar initiatives for the island of Gozo."
"All EU Member States which have island regions have applied for similar measures and have been given the opportunity by the EU to take such special measures."
"The measures themselves differ from island region to island region."
"They have, however, one thing in common: that is, to provide economic comfort to balance the negative aspects of island regions."
"The island of Gozo suffers from severe handicaps including double insularity, remoteness, small size and difficult topography."
"Countries much larger than Malta, such as Portugal, Italy and Greece, have been able to obtain special measures so as to provide attractive incentives to island regions."
"The smaller islands of the Maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable."
"The island of Gozo needs the assistance through the introduction of similar special measures."
"It is the duty of the Maltese Government to identify which special measures would be best suited and, subsequently, to apply to the EU to adopt such measures."
"It is up to the Government of Malta to reduce the hardships especially prevalent on the island of Gozo."
"in writing. - This is an extension of the 2002 tax derogation given to Portugal in respect of certain autonomous regions."
"I am in favour of such extension and have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of the Hübner report on the proposal for a Council decision authorising Portugal to apply reduced rates of excise duty in the autonomous region of Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and in the autonomous region of the Azores on locally produced and consumed liqueurs and eaux-de-vie."
"Bearing in mind the specific features of these outermost regions, I believe that this extension is vital for the survival of the local industry in these products and for the protection of employment in this sector."
"In view of the importance to agriculture and, consequently, the economy and employment in the Portuguese Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores, of the production of rum and eaux-de-vie respectively, as well as liqueurs in both regions, it is essential that the reduced rates of excise duty on these goods should continue to apply, as this will not lead to a situation of unfair competition within the internal market."
"The increase in retail price brought about by elimination of these rates of excise duty would make these products even less competitive compared with similar products imported from the rest of the EU and would therefore threaten the subsistence of the traditional products."
"It would have a disastrous effect on local industry and the regional economy at a socio-economic level, due to the impact that it would have on the family-run farms in those regions."
"The proposal approved in today's plenary sitting by an overwhelming majority allows for an extension to the concession granted in 2002 authorising Portugal to apply reduced rates of excise duty in Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and in the Azores on locally produced and consumed liqueurs and eaux-de-vie."
"Since the beginning of this process, I have done everything possible to ensure that this measure, which had expired at the end of 2008, would be renewed as a matter of urgency."
"Having secured the unanimous support of the Committee on Regional Development, this result was confirmed by today's vote, which maintains the tax reduction with effect from January 2009 until 2013."
"Madeira's rum and liqueur producers face permanent obstacles related to their outermost geographical position, insularity, difficult terrain and climate, and the smallness of their farms."
"If they ceased to benefit from this concession, they would be forced to raise their prices, which would impact on their activity and the employment that it generates, with dire consequences for the region."
"in writing. - This consists of a simple codification of texts without any change to their substance."
"I am in favour of such codification and have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - This is once again a codification without any alteration of substance, of which I am in favour, and I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - This consists of a simple codification of already existing texts and I have therefore voted in favour."
"The coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the broadcasting of television programmes is vital for the creation of a media space where the main theme is unity in diversity."
"It is just as important for us to be able to make European legislation as accessible as possible to all citizens."
"The report on the proposal for the Audiovisual Media Services Directive in its codified form, tabled before the plenary session, is purely a technical and legal measure whose benefits are, however, unquestionable."
"Codifying legislation which is constantly changing is a measure that gives Community law greater clarity and transparency, making it easier for EU citizens to understand."
"In this case, the codification proposal involves replacing the old 1989 directive with a new directive (without modifying the content) to which the acts that have supplemented it over the years have been added."
"I supported this initiative because, apart from its technical nature, we cannot overlook its value in supporting the proper operation of audiovisual media services, not to mention in terms of transparency as well."
"I concur with the text of this report since pluralism of information ought to be a fundamental principle of the European Union."
"Diversification of mass media leads to a proliferation of points of view, which is an essential feature in a democratic society."
"This argument also has an economic element."
"Conventional audiovisual media services (such as television) and those which have recently emerged (for example, video on demand) offer major employment opportunities in Europe, particularly through small- and medium-sized enterprises which will, in turn, boost economic growth and investment."
"in writing. - This concerns the codification of legislation concerning the protection of workers from exposure to asbestos."
"I am in favour of such codification and have hence voted in favour."
"Like the majority of my fellow Members, I voted in favour of making Community legislation clearer and more transparent."
"Indeed, by adopting this resolution, the European Parliament has supported the European Commission's desire to 'clean up' the texts by codifying the legislation on the protection of workers against asbestos."
"This resolution will mean that these rules, which are necessary for workers, can be applied better."
"in writing. - This concerns the codification of legislation concerning veterinary checks on animals entering the EU, and I have therefore voted in favour."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the approval of the report by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg concerning the draft Council Directive establishing principles for the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the EU from third countries."
"The new directive will clearly contribute towards the clarification and better understanding of the extensive current legal arrangements in this area."
"The directive concentrates on codifying laws without amending their actual content."
"From the perspective of Europe's citizens, a simplification and clarification of Community law contributes to greater legal certainty and, in my opinion, the codification carried out in the directive is therefore a step in the right direction, leading to the effective application of positive law."
"At the same time, I agree that a harmonisation of principles at the Community level will contribute not only towards guaranteeing security of supply, but also towards the stabilisation of an internal market where internal border controls have been removed and towards protecting animals entering the Community."
"Under the current regulations, where a shipment that violates animal protection laws is discovered, the authorities must, following a 'seizure' for animal protection reasons, hand back to the owner any unvaccinated animal young that have been separated from their mothers much too early once the problem has been rectified."
"In practice, of course, this situation is shamelessly exploited."
"This codification would be a good opportunity to amend the EU Transport Regulation so that pups could be seized on a permanent basis in the case of shipments that are not in accordance with the rules, thereby closing this back door."
"Unfortunately, we have allowed this opportunity to be missed."
"All the same, the codification overall does seem to effect an improvement of the regulations on animal protection, for which reason I voted in favour of the report."
"Given that nutrition is a significant factor in the health of the population and that animals are among the essential food products, it is particularly important that comprehensive protection is provided in this regard, and this should be effected, amongst other things, by means of veterinary checks."
"These veterinary checks are particularly important at the external borders of the Community, especially given that the standards in this regard in these third countries are often not as high as the European level."
"This requires more purposeful, more uniform and clearer regulations in order to ensure that comparable import checks are carried out at all the external borders."
"The current Commission proposal for a codified version of the Council Directive laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries is a step in this direction and therefore has my backing."
"in writing. - This is a codification without any substantial changes and therefore I have voted in favour."
"Like the majority of my fellow Members, I voted in favour of making the legislation on a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operations of agricultural holdings clearer and more transparent in order to improve this legislation and, above all, to make the text more readable."
"in writing. - This report consists of a simple codification of legislation on animal health conditions in the sphere of intra-Community trade."
"I am in favour of such codification and have voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (DE) Rearing poultry, for one thing, forms a significant part of economic activities in the agricultural sector, where it represents a source of income for some of the agricultural workforce."
"For another, eggs and poultry are amongst the commonest foodstuffs."
"For these reasons, trade involving these goods should also be clearly and uniformly regulated, amongst other things, in order to protect the health of the citizens."
"The current Commission proposal for a codified version of the Council Directive on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and eggs for hatching is in the interests of those working in agriculture and those trading in this field, as well as of the citizens of the EU as consumers, for which reason I support it."
"in writing. - This is a codification without any substantial change and therefore I have voted in favour."
"in writing. - This provides for visa-free travel between Mauritius and Member States of the EU."
"I am in favour of such an agreement and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens."
"EU citizens and Mauritian nationals who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements."
"The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories."
"I would point out that anyone who travels with the aim of carrying out a paid activity during a short stay cannot benefit from this agreement, and continues to be subject to the applicable rules of the Community and of each Member State in relation to the visa requirement or waiver and also access to employment."
"The agreement may be suspended or repealed, but that decision can only be made in relation to all the Member States."
"I also support the provisional implementation of the agreement pending its entry into force."
"This agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius envisages visa-free travel where citizens of the Contracting Parties travel to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of three months during a six-month period."
"I am voting against the conclusion of this agreement as the retention of the requirement for a visa represents a certain check on unwanted immigration, whereas a lifting of the visa requirement for stays of up to three months would provide sufficient time for those who, in reality, plan to stay for a prolonged period to build up social networks."
"in writing. - This provides for visa-free travel between the Seychelles and Member States of the EU."
"I am in favour of such an agreement and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Republic of the Seychelles, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens."
"EU citizens and Seychelles nationals who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements."
"The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories."

"I also support the provisional implementation of the agreement pending its entry into force."
"in writing. - This provides for visa-free travel between Barbados and Member States of the EU."
"I am in favour of such an agreement and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and Barbados, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens."
"EU citizens and nationals of Barbados who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements."

"The agreement may be suspended or repealed, but that decision can only be made in relation to all the Member States."
"I also support the provisional implementation of the agreement pending its entry into force."
"The reports before us in connection with the agreements between the European Community and numerous small island nations such as Mauritius and Barbados envisage a visa waiver where citizens of the Contracting Parties travel to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of three months during a six-month period."
"I reject these relaxations of entry requirements and therefore voted against the conclusion of these agreements as the retention of the requirement for a visa certainly represents an obstacle to criminality and thus severely restricts unwanted immigration."
"It is, furthermore, to be assumed that those who stay in the EU for three months on the basis of such visa waivers would make numerous contacts which they could then potentially use to descend into illegality."
"A rise in illegal criminal activity must be avoided at all costs."
"I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens."
"EU citizens and the nationals of the Federation who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements."

"I also support the provisional implementation of the agreement pending its entry into force."
"in writing. - This provides for visa-free travel between the Bahamas and Member States of the EU."
"I am in favour of such an agreement and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens."
"EU citizens and nationals of the Bahamas who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements."
"The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories."
"I would point out that anyone who travels with the aim of carrying out a paid activity during a short stay cannot benefit from this agreement, and continues to be subject to the applicable rules of the Community and of each Member State in relation to the visa requirement or waiver and also access to employment."
"The agreement may be suspended or repealed, but that decision can only be made in relation to all Member States."
"I also support the provisional implementation of the agreement pending its entry into force."
"in writing. - UKIP MEPs abstained because we do not believe that the European Union should be responsible for sending taxpayers' money to the victims of the Italian earthquake."
"We have every sympathy with those victims and believe that such donations should come from national governments or charities."
"As I pointed out earlier with regard to Reimer Böge's report about the earthquake in the Abruzzi, I believe that solidarity between Member States of the European Union and European support for States that are the victims of disasters provide a clear signal that the European Union, in adopting instruments of special aid like the European Union Solidarity Fund, shows itself capable of remaining united in adversity, and this is something of which we can indeed feel proud."
"Thus, in view of the possibility that the Commission may submit amending budgets in the case of 'unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances', which include the earthquake in Italy, I voted in favour of this report on the amendment to the European Union budget, so that the residents of the affected region will see the damage caused by the earthquake repaired more quickly, and a swift return to normal living conditions effected through the mobilisation of EUR 493.78 million from the EU Solidarity Fund."
"Since the mobilisation of EUR 493 771 159 from the European Union Solidarity Fund has been approved in favour of Italy, and since this fund does not have its own budget, it is necessary to amend the Community budget to ensure that the amount agreed is made available."
"Although we agree upon the need to provide the funds as quickly as possible, we regret that the proposal presented by the European Commission implies, among other budget headings, a reduction in funding for important community programmes compared with the previous and current multiannual financial framework."
"Examples of this include the projected reductions in the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance - Community programmes from the previous Community framework, 2002-2006 - or LIFE+, the Financial Instrument for the Environment."
"In our view, beyond the necessary adjustments to the Solidarity Fund to give it a budget heading with its own resources, it should not receive funding at the cost of the aforementioned Community programmes while, at the same time, there is an insistence on increasing expenditure for military and propaganda purposes."
"The funds now being allocated to the Solidarity Fund could preferably have been taken from those headings instead."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is in favour of emergency assistance, but it is up to the individual Member States, not the European Union, to provide such assistance."
"I agree that there should be additional support for workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market."
"It is essential that financial assistance to workers made redundant is made available as quickly as possible, and that European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) money, vital for the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market, is used more effectively."
"I would like to underline that Member States should provide more detailed information on the implementation of important gender equality and non-discrimination objectives by means of EGF-financed measures."
"in writing. - This report is in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I agree that the mobilisation of this fund is necessary in this case and have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"We are well aware of the negative effects of the economic crisis on the labour market and on society as a whole."
"We strongly sympathise with all those affected by the crisis and are pleased to see measures such as training that will help individuals overcome this."
"However, we are convinced that free trade is basically a force for good that benefits the development of Europe as a whole."
"We would therefore like to see the financial crisis being dealt with primarily by market-based means that promote free and fair trade."
"Unemployment is one of the main problems affecting the European Economic Area."
"Even before the emergence of the current financial crisis, which has increased and aggravated some of the earlier symptoms, the serious impact of globalisation and the resulting relocation of businesses on many people's lives were clear to see."
"The particular difficulties of the times in which we are living are obvious when we add to these problems the present lack of confidence in the markets and the shrinking of investment."
"In that respect, although I am in favour of internal market regulation, I believe that the exceptional nature of the crisis justifies exceptional countermeasures."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one of the tools that the European Union has at its disposal for helping unemployed workers under these circumstances."
"I believe that the case of the workers from Nokia GmbH, in the German region of Bochum, justifies European aid, as was previously given in Portugal."
"Aside from this aid, which is undeniably useful, the European Union must also take steps to promote a more robust and creative European market that will generate investment and jobs."
"That is the only way to tackle this problem effectively, seriously and sustainably."
"This case was about responding to a request for assistance from Germany for redundancies in the telecommunications sector, especially among Nokia GmbH workers, which fulfilled the eligibility criteria set out in the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund regulation."
"In reality, however, the mobilisation of this fund only alleviates some of the serious consequences of the economic and financial crisis."
"There needs to be a break with the neoliberal policies that are causing a real economic and social disaster in many countries of the European Union, particularly Portugal."
"Although we voted for this report, we cannot fail to notice the insufficiency of its measures, which are mere palliatives, and the real injustice of the regulation, which is more favourable towards countries with higher incomes, particularly those with higher wages und unemployment benefits."
"Therefore, we insist on policy change and the need for a real plan to support production and the creation of jobs with rights."
"in writing. - Mr President, I voted in favour of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's (EGF) investment of nearly EUR 5.6 million in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region, which has suffered from mass redundancies since the 1990's."
"As a result of the Finnish telecommunications company Nokia closing its production plant in Bochum in 2008 and relocating to more cost effective market areas, 2 300 more people in the region were made redundant."
"Being a Finn, I take a special interest in the plight of the workers who have lost their jobs due to the cessation of Nokia production in Bochum."
"The closure of the Nokia plant in Bochum was indeed the latest in a string of events compounding unemployment in the region."
"For this reason, I wholeheartedly welcome the investment from EGF in the region as a way of improving employment opportunities for the people of North Rhine-Westphalia."
"It was with the Nokia employees and their unfair redundancies in mind that we voted for this text."
"We are anxious to stress, however, that we are not satisfied with having to vote for the best of a bad lot: help with job searches in the context of absurd mass redundancies on the part of the world's leading mobile telephone manufacturer, Nokia, redundancies described here as one of the hazards of a form of globalisation that we should just put up with."
"We denounce this idea of globalisation 'adjustment', since this is how the European Union refers to social and human tragedies such as this, which see companies that post record profits relocate in order to make more profit, thus ruining the lives of hundreds of workers and an entire region."
"This charitable remedy (the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund) that is being proposed will not make people forget that the European Union is, in fact, directly responsible for the tragedy being suffered by the redundant employees, because of its choice of free and fair competition."
"Rather than supporting these 'adjustments' to all the huge uncertainties of the globalised capitalist economy, the European Union should prohibit such practices and protect European citizens."
"This report is in favour of mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) following redundancies in Germany."
"I fully approve of mobilising this fund - we need it in this instance - and so, like the majority of my fellow Members, I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one of the mechanisms that the European Union has available to it to help unemployed workers who have been made redundant as a result of the negative effects of globalisation."
"I believe that the case of the Nokia GmbH employees and of the German region of Bochum warrants mobilisation of European aid, just as it has already been mobilised previously for Portugal."
"in writing. - Siwiec was accused of insulting the religious beliefs of others during an event that took place a number of years ago."
"After reviewing the facts of the case, I believe that immunity should certainly not be waived."
"This is also the view of the rapporteur and therefore, I have voted in favour of the report."
"In today's vote, we voted to waive Mr Siwiec's immunity."
"That would mean that it would be possible for him to stand trial in Poland just like any other citizen."
"We have a great deal of sympathy for Mr Siwiec and we agree, for what it is worth, that the case that has been launched against him is unfounded and politically motivated."
"If, however, we believe that it should be possible for him to be tried in a court of law like everyone else, this is because we must have confidence that Poland respects the basic principles of democracy and the rule of law that are a precondition of being a Member State of the European Union."
"For the same reason, we always vote, as a matter of principle, to waive the immunity of Members of this House - irrespective of the actual case in question."
"The creation of the Schengen area by waiving internal border controls and the introduction of free movement within the territory of the EU are among the most important achievements of the European Union."
"Taking into account border permeability, we need high standards when actually putting the Schengen acquis into practice in order to be able to maintain an increased level of mutual trust between Member States, which also includes in their ability to implement the measures accompanying the abolition of controls at internal borders."
"We need to improve the evaluation mechanism for monitoring the application of the Schengen acquis."
"The need to maintain a high level of security and trust requires effective cooperation between the governments of Member States and the Commission."
"Bearing in mind the importance of this legislative initiative and its relevance in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms, it is regrettable that the European Parliament is playing the role of consultant rather than colegislator, as ought to have been the case."
"Consequently, I voted to reject the Commission's legislative proposal."
"I voted for this report, as the rapporteur's position is in line with the principles of citizens' freedoms, justice and home affairs."
"The establishment of an evaluation mechanism is important for all Member States."
"Since the codecision procedure is not being considered, the European Commission's proposal limits opportunities for cooperation between the Member States."
"The proposal drafted recently by the European Commission will have to be amended once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"The creation of a European area without border controls, through the Schengen Agreement, was an important step in constructing an open internal market with free movement of people and goods."
"However, if this area is to fulfil its potential, which I recognise, there needs to be a way of effectively evaluating its implementation by the various Member States."
"I therefore agree with strengthening the powers for monitoring Schengen, particularly through assessments (questionnaires and local visits, both arranged beforehand and unannounced) and post-assessment measures, so as to ensure adequate supervision of the way in which the various Member States operate, work together and control their external borders under the Schengen Agreement."
"I am aware that any deficiency or malfunction in the system carries serious risks for the internal security of the Union and jeopardises the Schengen area itself as an area of freedom, yet also security."
"I do not, however, agree with strengthening the Community-based nature of this assessment by bolstering the powers of the European Commission to the detriment of the intergovernmental system which has thus far prevailed in the Schengen Evaluation Group."
"For this reason, I vote for rejection of the Commission's proposal."
"We dare to speak of a Schengen acquis, but as someone who lives in Calais, I can confirm first-hand that, while the Schengen agreements have benefited the free movement of capital and goods, they still present a number of problems."
"Beyond the pleasant utopia of a Europe without borders, we are faced every day with the tragic reality of Schengen: inhumane living conditions for migrants."
"The Union and the Member States are doing little or nothing to deal with this tragedy."
"France, for its part, is disgracing itself by conducting media and police manhunts, such as the one in the 'jungle' of Calais."
"Therefore, even in terms of strict humanitarian action, the European Union is totally lacking, leaving the local authorities alone to deal with the problems."
"Let us stop crying crocodile tears and finally behave like responsible human beings."
"The situation unfolding in Calais is a major political problem for the Union."
"It will be resolved by neither the fortress Europe of Schengen nor by targeted humanitarian measures."
"We must stop free-trade policies, we must stop the free movement of capital, we must encourage food sovereignty, we must declare water and energy global public goods, and we must combat socio-economic inequalities."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission."
"Free questions"
"Vice-Chairman of the PPE Group. - (PT) Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to begin this first debate by congratulating you on this new instrument of political oversight and what it means for the advancement and development of parliamentary democracy in Europe."
"The winners in this will be Europe's citizens, through their representatives."
"Bearing in mind the latest developments - the Irish referendum, ratification by Poland and the recent statements by the President of the Czech Republic - I ask what your assessment is of the process for the Treaty of Lisbon to come into force."
"Has the President of the Commission been taking any action?"
"What is your projected date for the Treaty to come into force and, furthermore, with this provisional date in mind, has the Commission taken any steps as yet towards the transition of the treaties - from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon - or are we still in a state of expectation, so to speak; are we waiting to see what will happen?"
"Firstly, Mr Rangel, thank you for your greetings."
"I am very pleased to find this procedure now in the European Parliament."
"We also have it in Portugal, and I was involved in it both as leader of the opposition and as Prime Minister, and so I hope that this will prove to be a good opportunity for discussion with the honourable Members."
"In response to the specific question asked, to me the matter is obvious: all the countries have already approved the Treaty of Lisbon in democratic terms."
"Ireland did it by referendum, the other countries through parliament."
"The process of ratification is still ongoing in the Czech Republic."
"We are awaiting the completion of the process in the Constitutional Court, but once that process is finished, we will have completed the ratification process definitively, because there is a general principle of law, European law and international law, and that is the principle of loyal cooperation between the Member States and the institutions, and also the principle of good faith in negotiating international agreements."
"Vice-Chairman of the PPE Group. - (PT) President of the Commission, having listened to your response, I would like to know the following: during this phase in which everyone is waiting for the formation of the Commission, what essentially is your own perspective on this?"
"Will we just have an acting Commission up until the moment when the Czech Republic finally ratifies the Treaty, or will you proceed to appoint the new commissioners?"
"The European Council has decided that it can only appoint new commissioners when there is legal clarity on the Treaty, and we have not yet completed this process."
"Therefore, the Commission will just handle day-to-day business from November 1."
"Obviously, we hope that this process will be resolved as quickly as possible and we are preparing everything we possibly can for the new Commission, and will continue to do so."
"To be honest with you, honourable Members, the thing is that we do not have complete control over the timing; it does depend on the finalisation of the ratification process in the Czech Republic."
"Vice-Chairman of the S&D Group. - Unemployment could rise to 27 million in the European Union next year, turning this financial and economic crisis into a social crisis."
"In the light of this, would you now agree that the economic recovery plan agreed last December was not enough in itself?"
"In particular, would you agree that there is a need for a further stimulus - the ETUC has suggested 1% of GDP - aimed at a positive entry strategy into the labour market that would be aimed at protecting viable employment and creating new jobs, in promoting intelligent work sharing?"
"What will you do at EU level to promote jobs in the green and youth sectors?"
"It has been suggested, for example, that a single strategic platform should be created at a level to bring together all key actors to work together on growth, innovation and jobs in each sector and to coordinate existing instruments such as technology platforms, skills expert panels and joint technology initiatives."
"Would you agree that it would be a good idea for that to be implemented at European level?"
"President of the Commission. - I think that without our economic recovery plan, the situation would be much, much worse."
"In fact, there was a real cushion effect on the measures taken."
"We estimated around 5% of European Union GDP was spent over 2009 and 2010, that is around EUR 550 billion."
"So I think something was, in fact, done."
"Let us be realistic about it."
"I am in favour of all other efforts in terms of the combined platforms you have suggested to address the problems we face."
"Employment remains the most important problem."
"As you know, I have stated this several times and have, in fact, asked for a summit on employment."
"It was downgraded by some Member States."
"Probably you, Mr Hughes, can help us convince some Member States and governments that decided to downgrade that employment summit, because I believe employment is the most important problem that we have to face in the near future."
"Vice-Chairman of the S&D Group. - I will indeed work on those Member States."
"Just coming back to this idea of the level market entry strategy, would you agree that spending aimed at effectively reducing unemployment should not be seen as an additional burden on public finances but as a way to guarantee sustainability?"
"President of the Commission. - And, in fact, that is what we have been doing."
"Some of the special measures that have been taken by Member States - look at Kurzarbeit in Germany for instance - have been to increase spending, while reducing productivity to some extent, which I think, from a social point of view, was justified."
"I could say the same for the Welsh system which was approved in the United Kingdom."
"So there have indeed been good cases where, for social reasons, there has been more flexibility and more social spending, but that was a way of avoiding a further rise in unemployment, which remains my prime concern nowadays."
"Chairman of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, my question will come as no surprise to the President of the Commission."
"On Friday, Commissioner Kroes announced that there were significant indications that the German aid for Opel contravenes the European rules on State aid and the internal market and that it disadvantages plants in other countries."
"Günter Verheugen, on the other hand, could not see a problem; indeed, he said on the radio that Opel was already on the right track."
"Yesterday, a fellow Member from the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) even asked that we blow the whistle on Commissioner Kroes."
"He spoke of her as a commissioner who was very controversial, who lacked objectivity, who was anti-German, who could not throw Europe into turmoil two weeks before the end of her term of office."
"In my view, Commissioner Kroes is just doing her job, and so my question to you is very simple, Commission President: will you support your commissioner Neelie Kroes, yes or no?"
"President of the Commission. - I have always supported my Commissioners, including Neelie Kroes."
"It was, of course, after having my consent that she took the decision - namely the contacts she had with the German Government asking for clarification."
"We are now waiting for a response from the undertakings involved."
"I am grateful that, thanks to good cooperation, we are making very good progress in this case."
"I understand that, following the doubts the Commission expressed on the rightfulness of the bidding process, there will be a reassessment by GM and Opel Trust of the offers to buy Opel, based on commercial conditions."
"I am confident we can reach a solution that is compatible with European internal market and State aid rules."
"I have very often said that we cannot make compromises on the issues of the internal market and competition rules in Europe."
"If we do, we will no longer have an internal market or our common European project."
"Chairman of the ALDE Group. - (NL) I have no further questions."
"I would only note that the President of the Commission has stated very clearly here that he, too, vouches for the letter sent by Commissioner Kroes, and that it also has the approval of the Commission as a whole."
"That is indeed important, as it means that Commissioner Verheugen should choose his words more carefully when he says that there are no problems."
"There either are or there are not."
"President of the Commission. - Not only did the letter have my support but before Mrs Kroes sent the letter, I told her to send a letter, so my position on those issues is very clear."
"Mr Verhofstadt, let us be clear."
"We have three people in the Commission who have the right to give an opinion, but the positions of the Commission are the positions expressed by the President on behalf of the college and by the relevant Commissioner."
"Co-Chairman of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, with great concern for a possible failure of the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen, this Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety yesterday re-affirmed old demands of the European Council and adopted them with great urgency and very strong support."
"The committee proposed that the Council should once again deal with the necessity of laying down a CO2 reduction target of 30% for the European Union, opening up the possibility of 40% for the industrialised nations, and it proposed - and this is key to the international negotiations - that Europe should provide EUR 30 billion for the climate fund for the developing countries by 2020."
"What will you do, what can you do, in order to bring these important, necessary and justified demands to the attention of the Council?"
"President of the Commission. - As I said publicly at the high-level event in New York, and also in Pittsburgh, I am very worried at the slow pace of negotiations for Copenhagen."
"There are three potential stumbling blocks for Copenhagen, relating not just to financing: the clear lack of ambition as regards emission reduction pledges from some developed countries outside the European Union; the reluctance of major developing countries - the big emerging economies - to come forward with convincing proposals for their mitigation actions; and also the absence of a solid financial offer by the developed countries on the negotiation table."
"These are the three stumbling blocks."
"I hope that the European Union keeps its leadership position and that the European Council comes up with a solid financial proposal at the end of this month."
"I hope we will have time to discuss this in more detail tomorrow, because climate change will be one of the main topics of discussion at the next European Council."
"The Commission will certainly fight for an ambitious programme because, as I have always said, climate change is not only an environmental matter, but also a development matter."
"Co-Chairman of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) President of the Commission, in numerous discussions for information purposes, including with high-ranking UN officials, we are told that the European Union's efforts have now fallen behind those of countries such as China and, as far as its endeavours are concerned, Japan."
"How can you still claim that we will be playing a leadership role?"
"President of the Commission. - I will be extremely happy the day that happens, but unfortunately it is not true."
"So far, the European Union is the only block that has committed to binding targets that are now translated into legislation."
"We welcome some positive developments, namely the good political announcement made by the new Prime Minister of Japan - I have personally congratulated him - but so far, it is a political announcement."
"We welcome some of the national plans announced by China, but so far China has not agreed to make these binding in the negotiations in Copenhagen."
"We welcome other positive developments, but in fact, we are leading the world in this fight against climate change."
"I would like to have someone else around us when we are leading, because it is sometimes not very comfortable to be in the lead and to be alone."
"But the reality is that others have to match our level of ambition."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank you for being living proof that promises made by politicians are fulfilled."
"When my wife asks me to do something, and wants to know if I will be sure to do it, I always say, 'Yes - after all, I am a politician.'"
"You have shown, today, that you keep your word as a politician."
"You are with us, and you are answering the questions of the Chamber very well."
"Mr President, in your speech to us here, you said that it is extremely important to strengthen the single market, and that strengthening the single market is a prescription for the crisis in Europe."
"I should like to ask you, Mr President, on behalf of my group, what you intend to do over the next few months so that the strengthening of the single European market will help to fight the serious economic crisis with which we are faced today."
"President of the Commission. - Thank you very much, Mr Kamiński."
"In fact, I said in my political guidelines, which I believe were endorsed by the European Parliament with the strong support you gave for my re-election, that the internal market is a priority and we should fight all kinds of economic nationalism."
"I have good news for all of you."
"Just today, I entrusted Mario Monti with a mission to prepare a report on the future of the single market, containing options and recommendations for an initiative to relaunch the single market."
"I am delighted that he has accepted this mission, as it is a way of having some outside expertise, to build support, hopefully together with the European Parliament, so that we can give a new impetus to the internal market, and to see how we can make the internal market fit for the 21st century."
"I believe that this is particularly important for consumers and also for small and medium-sized companies, which sometimes feel the pressure and suffer from distorting behaviour in the common market."
"Mr President, I would like, finally, to say how very important it is for us, for our group, that in this work to strengthen the single market, in this building of our common Europe, you have not forgotten the differences which exist in Europe."
"You have not forgotten that we have countries which have only recently acceded to the European Union, and which are, in a sense, economically handicapped."
"We know that you have always acted very fairly towards these new Member States, and I hope that you will continue to do so."
"President of the Commission. - I think the internal market is the best way to protect all the Member States, whether they are new or old, big or small, rich or poor."
"It is a policy of justice because it is the best way to protect the weaker, namely the consumers who are usually the weaker."
"It is also the way to protect small and medium-sized companies with regard to the big monopolies or oligopolies."
"So it is this - the inspiration for the internal market - that is such an important acquis of our European Union."
"Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced."
"Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009."
"For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease."
"According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010."
"Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks?"
"Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis?"
"Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT."
"Is that your idea of a social Europe?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, precisely because we are concerned with the figures you have mentioned - and broadly I agree with them - they are indeed our forecasts."
"As I have said several times before, we are preparing the exit strategy but we are not recommending that we start implementing the exit strategy now."
"So we are saying that we should keep the stimulus programmes."
"The finance ministers have been meeting and I think that they have agreed that we should not implement the exit strategy before 2011."
"So we still need to keep the stimulus to our economy, precisely because of our concerns, namely on the social front and unemployment in particular."
"But, as you know, this crisis was also provoked by very large imbalances, by high public spending, by financial orgies."
"I think that we should not keep an unsustainable model so at a certain moment, we have to come back to sustainability."
"This is also a question of solidarity with future generations."
"Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, have I understood you correctly, namely that 2011 could be the date for this 'exit'?"
"President of the Commission. - I cannot confirm that now but I can tell you that, most likely, it will not be before then."
"I think that is the consensus between the finance ministers and, by the way, that was also the position that the European Union brought to the G20."
"Now there is also the effort towards global coordination of these policies."
"That does not mean that all the regions of the world will take the same decisions at the same time, but during this crisis, we have seen that we are, for better or for worse, connected, and we have to try to articulate these exit strategies globally."
"So most likely, it will not be before 2011 but we should continue to monitor the economic situation very closely."
"Co-Chairman of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, it is very good to see you here."
"A chance to hold the executive to account surely must be welcomed."
"As you know, I have not always been one of your biggest supporters, but I have to concede you have done very well."
"You have managed to ignore the French referendum result, you have managed to ignore the Dutch referendum result and you have managed to bully the Irish into submission the second time around."
"So you have almost got your Treaty."
"Now, of course, it is time to pick the President - the big global figurehead of the European Union."
"Tony Blair is the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers."
"I just wondered whether you agree with me that his continued support for Britain to join the euro, his surrender of GBP 2 billion a year of the British rebate and his whole approach towards Britain's membership of the European Union - his refusal to give the British a referendum - all show that he has sufficient pro-European credentials to become the President?"
"Indeed, was this the deal that I predicted back in 2005?"
"Was this agreed all along?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, Mr Farage, do not be so sad about the result in Ireland."
"It was not a great result - just 67% of the people!"
"When there is a real debate with real ownership, we have shown that there can be strong support for Europe."
"In fact, it was a declaration of independence by Ireland from the United Kingdom Independence Party, because you were there campaigning and the Irish said 'no' to you and to your party."
"(Applause)"
"Now, regarding the future President of the Council, I am not going to comment."
"That is a decision for the European Council."
"What I would like to tell you very frankly is that there are no hidden agreements and there are no hidden agendas."
"If there were, I would already know."
"So there are no hidden agreements or secret bargaining."
"What I can tell you is the following: we need a President of the Council who is a committed European and who gives consistency all the time, because I do not think it proper to have a Council that changes its agenda completely every six months."
"I am a very strong supporter of a strong European Council presence which gives coherence and consistency to the Council and that works, of course, hand in hand with the Commission and is fully committed to the European project and to Community matters."
"Co-Chairman of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, I am disappointed."
"It is Question Time, and a 'yes' or a 'no' would have been easier, but never mind."
"Whether it is Mr Blair or not, the fact is he will not be democratically elected; you yourself have not been democratically elected; in fact, doesn't this rather sum up the whole EU?"
"Isn't it a rather wonderful organisation for giving retired, clapped-out ex-premiers some real executive power?"
"You could have democratised the EU with this Treaty."
"You chose not to."
"Does national democracy matter, or is the European Union, in your opinion, a greater good?"
"President of the Commission. - It is precisely because the European Union is not the kind of integrated state you appear to fear so much that the President of the Council is not directly elected by people but is chosen by the democratically elected Heads of Government of Europe."
"That is precisely the logic of it."
"I myself was not only supported unanimously by the democratically elected Heads of Government, but also by a strong majority in this Parliament."
"So I feel I have strong democratic legitimacy."
"(Applause)"
"In my previous life as a national politician, I was democratically elected to my national parliament at the age of 29, and I should tell you that it is more difficult to be elected President of the Commission than Prime Minister in most of our countries!"
"(HU) Tomorrow at 15.00, I am holding a press conference about the human rights crisis situation that has persisted since 2006."
"I cordially invite and expect to see Mr President and all my fellow Members."
"According to information from the National Legal Aid Service, the huge number of court rulings confirm that in autumn 2006, acts of brutal police terror took place in Hungary, especially on 23 October, during the 50th anniversary commemoration."
"On government orders, the police committed a number of atrocities, including shooting 14 people in the eye thereby blinding many of them, and they held as political prisoners and tortured several hundred innocent people."
"Are you aware, Mr President, that Kinga Göncz, Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, was a member of the government that sanctioned the shooting?"
"I would like to hear your opinion about this and I cordially and respectfully invite you and expect to see you at tomorrow's press conference."
"President of the Commission. - I am following all the developments in the Member States, but let us be clear: the Commission does not have the power to intervene in some internal matters of the Member States, and this is the kind of issue on which we cannot provide an answer here because this is an internal debate that is going on in Hungary."
"We have the authority as the Commission to intervene in any issue of fundamental rights when it is the implementation of Community law."
"This was not the case in the events referred to by the distinguished Member of Parliament."
"So I would ask you not to put questions to me that you can better treat at national parliament level rather than here in the European Parliament."
"(HU) Am I right in understanding then that freedom of assembly, freedom of opinion, human rights and even the European Convention on Human Rights are not, according to what you have said, part of European Union law?"
"Are human rights not part of the European Union's system of values and legal system?"
"If not, I have been misinformed."
"President of the Commission. - Of course, human rights are part of the European Union but we have a system based on the rule of law and we assume that all Member States, including your country, are countries governed by the rule of law."
"So you have the option of putting your questions to your courts, and there are also appeals to the European Court of Human Rights or to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"So we have a system of human rights."
"What I cannot do and should not do is enter into national political debates between the different political parties."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I should like to thank the Chairs of the political groups most sincerely for keeping to time, and for conducting the debate so well."
"I would also like to thank Mr Barroso."
"We must keep to time if we are to have a lively debate."
"So thank you very much, everyone."
"Consequences of the financial crisis on employment and social cohesion"
"(NL) Mr President, my question concerns the crisis-response measures."
"When it comes to emission targets in relation to climate change, Europe is ahead of the United States."
"The United States are ahead, however, in terms of private-sector investment in technological innovations and sustainability, which is extremely important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and for employment."
"In fact, it was also a cornerstone of your crisis and recovery plan."
"Yet what is your ambition in this regard?"
"When are we going to reach the same level as the United States, and what is the Commission doing, and what can it do, to ensure this level is reached?"
"Broadly speaking, our SMEs are still running up against a great many barriers and, as a result, are missing out on growth potential."
"What are you going to do to complete the internal market; which, after all, is a major source of growth for our employment?"
"President of the Commission. - I have already answered a previous speaker with some ideas on the internal market but, regarding the point you are clearly making on technology, I fully agree."
"We are behind the United States and others in terms of investment in new technologies."
"That is why, for instance, in this special package, we have approved a European economic recovery plan."
"We have put a lot of emphasis on investment in some issues regarding the climate agenda and energy security."
"We are linking those two issues."
"That is why we have very recently come up with the SET Plan and we are also urging Member States to devote more resources to financing green technologies, in other words, all the technology that can enable us to become a more sustainable, greener economy."
"Certainly this is a matter that we should also consider for the next financial perspectives."
"As you know, we will put forward our budget review before the end of the year."
"There will also be an opportunity to have a good debate about where, in the future, we should place our emphasis in terms of investment."
"Colleagues, could I ask you not to ask supplementary questions."
"I have a very long list of names here, and it would be much more interesting if more Members could ask questions."
"(EL) Mr President, the Commission quite rightly issued a recommendation in 2008 about integrating more people into the labour market."
"I should first of all like to ask if, other than this recommendation and the measures taken by the Member States, you intend, as the European Commission, to take additional measures in order to strengthen the open method of coordination in the social sector?"
"I refer to measures which are compatible with viable industrial policies, in order to increase employment."
"Secondly, 2010 has been declared - as we all know - to be the European year for combating poverty."
"Our objective is to strengthen social cohesion."
"The question is very simple, Mr President: will you put all your energy, will you have the courage - you personally - to fight for quantitative targets on the question of poverty?"
"I would ask in particular that you do not refer me to the Member States, as you did when briefing the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"President of the Commission. - I have said earlier that my number one concern is unemployment, but to fight unemployment we should not only have a reactive position but a proactive position."
"This, I think, could be achieved through the revision of the Lisbon strategy and an integrated vision for 2020."
"We have to base the European Union's long-term strategy on new sources of sustainable growth, for instance, what we call 'white' jobs, in social services, where there have been 3.3 million new jobs since 2000."
"That is 16% of all new jobs."
"The market for green products and services is also set to double by 2020, creating huge opportunities for green jobs, so we are promoting a mapping exercise across the European Union to anticipate the jobs and the skills needed."
"I am therefore determined to work in this new strategy to reinforce the social priority, as I already said to you when we discussed the broader political guidelines for the next mandate."
"As we know, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs in the current economic crisis and many of these are older people who are at a severe disadvantage when they try to get new jobs."
"Even though the 2000 Employment Directive should be adhered to in each Member State, many of those older workers still do not know what their rights are under this Directive, and many Member States are flouting the rules."
"Even if some workers do know their rights, all too often they find it impossible to take action individually without any back-up."
"At present we do not yet have legislation to protect many people against discrimination in access to goods and services, but we do have the Employment Directive."
"Can you tell us what action is being taken against Member States who do not implement it properly, and what mechanisms could be put in place to help older and disabled workers to achieve their rights?"
"President of the Commission. - Whenever there is non-compliance with our directives by Member States, we launch infringement proceedings, so when there is a specific case, we can and will act."
"Regarding the overall issue you mention, let me tell you that this crisis has made more than five million Europeans unemployed."
"The most affected categories are young people and migrants."
"Unemployment now stands at 9.1% in the European Union, but that unemployment rate is more than double in young workers (19.8%) and migrants (19.1%)."
"These are the most important concerns we now have in terms of social matters."
"The issue of tackling child poverty also remains a very important priority."
"We are also, of course, following the situation as regards older people, in accordance with the current directives."
"(MT) I believe that it is a worthwhile matter to talk about how we can create more jobs in the European Union."
"However, I think that we should also consider how to safeguard jobs, and prevent them from being lost."
"My government intervened at the point where the crisis was most being felt."
"I believe that with the government's intervention, thousands of jobs were saved, obviously through an increase in expenditure in the social sector."
"Do you not think that the Commission needs to make more of an effort in order to ensure that this takes place in every European Union country?"
"I know that you will bring up the newly amended Globalisation Fund, and the fact that it is being used to help even more workers; however, I believe that we must do our utmost to ensure that these people's jobs are safeguarded, so that they will not need to make use of the Globalisation Fund."
"I think this should be our actual target."
"President of the Commission. - Not only have we revised the rules of the globalisation fund, we have also reprogrammed the European Social Fund with the fast-tracking of EUR 1.8 billion to reinforce active labour market policies."
"On cohesion policy, we have also made some changes to simplify the rules and to frontload payments."
"This is a very important policy as well."
"I have already mentioned the EUR 550 billion of the stimulus plan and, of course, I may also mention the Globalisation Adjustment Fund as well as some other proposals that we have made."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that there was one idea the Member States did not follow, namely to suspend cofinancing for the Social Fund."
"We put this on the Council table, but it was rejected."
"I still hope that with your support, we can have that, because there are some countries that simply do not have the financial means to complement the funding for the Social Fund out of their own money."
"So we are also using to the maximum all the instruments we have at Community level to back up what the Member States can do themselves to fight this unemployment."
"(ES) Mr President, thank you for this interesting debate that we are having today."
"You said, regarding employment, that some Member States did not attend the Prague Summit."
"What is more serious, Mr President, is that the Council, in the greatest employment crisis in the history of Europe - today 10 000 Europeans will have lost their jobs, and the same tomorrow and the day after - has not taken any serious initiative and there has not been a single summit on employment."
"You could also have said that the Commission has an agenda from last year, which was outdated even then and which is now failing to meet the very pressing needs of millions and millions of citizens, of a whole generation of Europeans and the whole welfare state, whose future is at stake."
"Mr President I want to ask for your leadership: we need active leadership, leadership that breaks with apathy and a lack of transparency."
"You need to tell the Council that we cannot go on like this."
"We need a Commission that not only manages ordinary resources and ordinary matters but which, at this difficult time - and I know that it is difficult for you, Mr President - places itself at the head of Europe, in a great institutional agreement to give hope to a whole generation of Europeans."
"The fact is that we are doing all we can and, as I said when I outlined the programme, we are giving social matters a higher profile because there is currently an emergency situation from a social point of view."
"To give an example, that was why I declared the need to examine the social impact in all new legislation."
"That is why we are promoting the common active inclusion principles as Community policy."
"That is also why I am able to say to the Member States that we are supporting social investment."
"Social expenditure, which made up 28% of GDP in 2008, will rise to 31% in 2010."
"That represents about EUR 3 500 billion more!"
"We are making a real effort here, but of course, Mr Cercas, the truth is that it has to be a collective effort by the Commission, Parliament and the Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Europe means freedom, democracy and solidarity or, to put it another way, social and ecological responsibility."
"However, you and the Commission have had an entirely one-dimensional focus on the freedom element of that for a long time - and specifically in that regard only on economic freedom, on freedom understood purely in the economic sense - and on regulating in numerous areas where no regulation is needed, yet, where what is at stake are billions, on the world financial markets, your focus has been largely on not interfering and not regulating because you believed that that would lead to the best results for everyone."
"We have seen the catastrophic results that that has led to and I ask you in all clarity how and through what projects and plans you intend to make clear to this Parliament and the people of Europe in a credible way that you and the Commission have learnt from this catastrophe and will change our course radically?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, the question of credibility is a subjective question for you."
"I think that the response to this question was given by Parliament, which gave me a new mandate recently, so it shows that this Parliament believes I am credible to go ahead with this policy."
"In fact, we are pursuing our policy in response to the economic and financial crisis."
"We have taken important decisions; we are leading globally on regulatory and supervisory measures we have taken recently."
"Based on the report I commissioned to the de Larosière Group, we have tabled some proposals which I hope will be approved by the Council and by Parliament."
"Just today, at a meeting of the Commission, we approved the communication on derivatives, which will, of course, have to be followed up by concrete legislation."
"So indeed we are responding to the financial crisis in all its aspects, including regulatory and supervisory, and I have already taken some decisions during this Commission, and the next Commission will, of course, follow this path because I believe the situation demands it."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to talk about the aid approved under the Temporary Framework aimed at reducing the problems that have arisen as a result of the economic crisis, and specifically about Opel."
"I would like to ask you whether the Commission is examining whether the aid received by Germany under the Temporary Framework was dependent on a prior agreement regarding the geographical distribution of the restructuring measures, which would not be in line with the purpose of this aid."
"If this is the case, I would like to know whether you agree with the company having the freedom to revise the distribution and restructuring of Opel according to its own economic and production criteria and maintaining the greatest possible number of jobs."
"I have already responded to this question, but I will say that we did have a few doubts about the way in which this process was conducted."
"The Commission expressed these doubts, and General Motors and Opel Trust are now reassessing the way in which the offer to buy Opel was made, and to verify whether, in fact, this offer was made on a commercial basis or not."
"We, the European Commission, will do everything we can to ensure that the solution complies with the internal market regulations and the rules on State aid, and we will, of course, be objective and strict in applying these rules."
"Every single European country is united in that we all face rising unemployment, which is obviously not just a social crisis, but also puts extra burdens on Member States' public purses, with rising welfare costs, falling taxes and increased training."
"Given this, would you agree, Mr Barroso, that we, as Members of this Parliament, and the Commission should be extra cautious with every penny that we add onto public sector burdens?"
"If you do agree, firstly, how would you advise us to vote in the budget debate on Thursday?"
"Secondly, why do we keep meeting in Strasbourg?"
"President of the Commission. - I support the proposed budget for next year so my advice is to vote 'yes'."
"Regarding the issue of being careful and rigorous, I agree with you."
"We have to be extremely careful with all taxpayers' money, and we have to see the priorities."
"Today, there is a clear social urgency in some Member States."
"There are problems of social exclusion and poverty that, I am sure, are a matter of concern to all Members of this House, so we have to see what is the best way."
"As you know, the Commission has been extremely strict, under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, in committing ourselves and the European Union to the rules of sustainability."
"Of course, we do not think that problems can be solved just by throwing money at them, but in fact there are situations, like the current one, when we believe special attention has to be given to a situation of social urgency."
"Exceptional measures were needed for what was an unprecedented situation."
"It is a question, as always, of balance in judgment."
"(HU) President of the Commission, according to European Commission Regulation No 800/2008, wage subsidies for people with disabilities were reduced to 75% of the maximum amount."
"This is why, since 1 January 2009, employment for people with disabilities and for those whose work capacity has changed has been hit by a crisis."
"As a result, the sources of employment provided for people with disabilities have decreased significantly due to budgetary restraint."
"This is also the reason why the national support provided in many countries, for example Hungary, for setting up a job creation team, has been jeopardised."
"They say that the European Union is to blame."
"I would therefore like to ask a question."
"During a financial crisis, how does the European Commission want to handle the employment rights of people with disabilities, the task of preserving jobs for them and the principle of equal pay for equal work?"
"This regulation was formulated before the crisis."
"President of the Commission. - As the distinguished Member knows, I am sure, the European Commission has put forward a proposal - a horizontal directive - for non-discrimination that also includes disability."
"And now that draft proposal is in your hands and in the hands of the European Council."
"So I really hope that it will be approved because we are certainly against any kind of discrimination against disabled people."
"Many of the problems you have mentioned have to be dealt with at national level because these are the measures in terms of concrete support that are to be taken by the national social security systems."
"But in the European Union, we are doing everything we can to have a binding framework that commits ourselves and all the Member States to the principle of non-discrimination and to special protection for disabled people."
"(FR) Mr Barroso, you have been appointed by this Chamber to be the next President of the Commission."
"Your next urgent task is to organise that Commission so that it can serve a Europe that is hauling itself out of the crisis."
"On that basis, how do you plan to use the inadequate Community tools that are at our disposal so as to optimise them, and how do you envisage dividing up the portfolios so that we can deal with the issues that arise?"
"I am well aware that everything depends on your discussion with the Heads of State or Government, but as President of the Commission, you must share your vision with them."
"How can we link these strategies that are available to us?"
"How can we divide up the portfolios so as to take account of the lessons learnt from this crisis?"
"With regard to the tools, I will cite just one example."
"The Globalisation Adjustment Fund is today at odds with State aid strategies that stop us from implementing industrial policies that would help us come out of the crisis."
"What are your proposals?"
"What mandate are you going to ask the Heads of State or Government for, and how are you going to ask them to divide up the portfolios?"
"The distribution of the portfolios is not a competence of the Heads of State or Government, but a competence of the President of the Commission, and I will certainly use that competence in the manner that I consider most appropriate."
"I already made some announcements during my discussion with you about the programme of the next Commission, but in fact, I am in contact with the Heads of State or Government."
"I can also tell you that, only today, I sent a letter to everyone asking them to send me female candidates for the College as well."
"Indeed, I am very concerned about the problem of the balance between men and women; if I do nothing, I will have practically no women, because the governments generally want only male candidates for the next Commission."
"I therefore sent this letter only today."
"As regards the actual distribution, there will be no major change."
"I already announced the main innovations during my debate with you."
"These included, in particular, a commissioner for justice and fundamental rights, and a commissioner for action in the field of climate change, and, of course, I now need competent men and women who are committed to Europe, who can successfully complete their respective tasks under the various portfolios, which will correspond to the priorities for European Union action."
"Hitherto, the creation of wealth and the measure of well-being have been based largely on consumption, and so industry has been encouraged to pay little attention to the real value of raw materials used, even if their price is low, or to the real cost of waste produced."
"How does your Commission intend to ensure that growth in future will be of a different nature and that we will not find ourselves in a situation where, after another 20 years of growth, we have a planet unable to sustain what we are doing and a society unable to afford the real costs of living in such a way?"
"President of the Commission. - I would like to thank Graham Watson for this very important question."
"In fact, that is the core of the programme for the next five years: to invest more in smart, green growth, sustainable growth."
"This is very important."
"We have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past."
"I am for a strong industrial base in Europe - but a strong industrial base for the new age of sustainability, where we have to think about green development, green technologies."
"That is where we can create new products, new markets."
"This is a good example."
"That is why we are organising our future programme in terms of what I called, in my political guidelines, 'new sources of growth' because, with the traditional sources of growth, we will not win the battle of competitiveness with big emerging economies like China and India."
"So innovation has to be at the core, at the centre of our agenda for growth, new sources of growth promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy: smart green development and innovation."
"I think innovation will be key for the development of the European economy in the future."
"(DA) Mr Barroso, the financial crisis has given rise to an economic crisis on an historic scale and, at this moment, unemployment is rising dramatically in Europe."
"Unemployment amongst young people - those under 25 - in Europe is 19.8%, as you yourself said, and in Spain more than one in three of those under 25 are unemployed."
"Right now, we are in the process of making a mess of a whole generation and so far, Mr Barroso, you have done pretty much nothing to solve this problem."
"Today, I have heard that you are very concerned about this, and I am pleased to hear that - I would like to see the evidence."
"Even if the responsibility for employment policy lies at the national level, there is also a need for European responsibility and European initiatives."
"There are three things that I would like to call for. First of all, Commissioner Špidla promised 5 million traineeships for young people in Europe."
"What happened to them?"
"Secondly, we are currently adopting growth and rescue packages all over Europe."
"Why do these packages not include a targeted jobs scheme for young people?"
"Thirdly, what will you do to achieve a stronger social profile and a stronger plan for young people in the new post-Lisbon strategy?"
"President of the Commission. - I repeat that we have used to the full our existing instruments."
"We have Community-level instruments, but there are some instruments that are national-level instruments."
"What we can do is to work with the Member States to make the most of these, to exchange best practice and to urge them to follow this."
"Commissioner Špidla, who has done a great job in very difficult circumstances, is, in fact, together with the Commission as a whole, asking for the Member States to develop five million apprenticeships."
"We are making available some best practices."
"For instance, in France, there have been extremely good practices from private companies promoting in-house training in their companies and promoting apprenticeships with public money, but with part of it also funded by the companies themselves."
"So this is indeed a priority and we are doing it with all our instruments - the European Social Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the doubling of the facility for balance of payment support to new Member States and non-euro area countries."
"We have used our instruments to the full but we have to work with the Member States in a reinforced manner to address these social concerns and, as you mentioned especially, the concern of youth unemployment."
"(PT) Mr President, in order to reduce poverty and unemployment, we have to create jobs with rights, support production and improve universal, free public services."
"In other words, we have to invest in other policies."
"We need to do the opposite of what has been done so far."
"For example, we were startled to learn, in this day and age, of a study by the Directorate General for Employment and the Eurofund which presented two scenarios for the textile industry, predicting the loss of 20 to 25% of Community jobs by 2020, while a third scenario even suggested we would lose 50% of current jobs in the sector within the European Union."
"How, then, can this situation be reconciled with the new proposals being drawn up aimed at the liberalisation of international trade, without taking account of the consequences in Portugal and other countries in the European Union which have very sensitive sectors, such as the textile industry, agriculture, and a plethora of micro- and small businesses which are being choked by these policies?"
"I do not think that shutting off Europe is the solution for Portugal or any other European country."
"Europe is the biggest exporter of goods and services in the world, and there is nothing at all to be gained by adopting protectionist policies."
"There are indeed some sectors, often called 'traditional sectors' in certain European countries, especially, but not exclusively, in the south of Europe, which are particularly vulnerable to the new conditions of international competition, and that is why they are making a special effort to adapt to these new conditions."
"As I said in an earlier response, this means that we must seek new sources of growth and competitiveness within Europe."
"However, we should certainly not shut ourselves in and close off Europe, which would mean running the risk that other markets would close themselves off in turn from our exports."
"We need to invest in innovation, invest in training, invest in new sources of growth and aim to be more competitive, while at the same time, as you said - and we agree on this point - ensuring that this is not at the expense of the social standards that are important in Europe."
"We are not suggesting that our social standards should be lowered."
"We are also trying to help others raise their social standards, but I certainly do not advocate that Europe should shut itself off."
"I think that it is in Europe's best interests to maintain open global markets."
"Mr Barroso, the financial crisis in the UK is very serious."
"One of the many sectors struggling is the agricultural sector."
"From 1 January 2010, things are set to get a lot worse with the introduction of EID, which is 'electronic identification of sheep'."
"The equipment used to scan the sheep is not accurate."
"I have been told it is only 79% accurate."
"If you drive your car, Mr Barroso, down the road, and the brakes only work 79% of the time, you will no doubt at some point crash."
"I fear that the agricultural sheep sector is also likely to crash with the introduction of EID, with its flawed equipment."
"The bizarre situation is that if EID comes into force in January, we will know how many sheep we have in the UK, where they are and all their movements, yet in the UK - due to unlimited immigration - we have no idea of how many people we have in our country, or who they are or what movements they will make."
"Will you, Mr Barroso, speak to the rest of the Commission and only introduce EID on a voluntary basis until the equipment used is 100% accurate?"
"That is a very specific question."
"We prefer general questions about the crisis and how to overcome it."
"The President of the European Commission cannot be informed about specific issues in individual countries, so please be more general in your questions."
"President of the Commission. - I just want to say that I do not like that comparison between sheep and people very much."
"I do not think it is in very good taste, really."
"(Applause)"
"Having said that, we are committed to implementing the identification you mentioned, but of course we are being careful."
"If there are problems in the implementation, we are ready to look at it."
"However, I feel that the measures that have already been taken regarding the identification of sheep are indeed good in general."
"Let us see how it works in practice."
"(HU) Mr Barroso, the global financial crisis triggered in the United States has spread to the real economy, resulting in the loss of millions of jobs and creating a state of social crisis."
"The European Union is endeavouring to take steps in the case of companies like Opel, and if any plan is implemented, it will also involve direct help."
"At the same time, it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs, in fact, the majority of jobs."
"Do you think, Mr President, that this measure to help them is sufficient?"
"Hungary is in a particularly difficult position as it only has foreign commercial banks."
"In this case, could direct State aid be given, or is this economic nationalism, which you have declared war on, or else market dogmatism?"
"President of the Commission. - My clear answer is no: what we have done is not sufficient."
"We have to do more for SMEs;"
"I think it is a priority."
"We have approved the Small Business Act; that is good."
"We have improved the late payments issue by reducing delays in payment; that was good and was very much welcomed by SMEs."
"We are, of course, trying to limit all bureaucratic and administrative procedures that create administrative burdens, particularly for SMEs, and we are committed to making life easier for SMEs."
"They are, as you said - and I agree with you - one of the most important sectors for creating more jobs, and this is part of our policy."
"Another measure that we have taken recently, which I have not yet mentioned today, was to increase to EUR 500 000 the threshold of State aid allowed in direct support by Member States to some SMEs in special difficulties."
"So I think SMEs should remain a priority of our action for sustainability, including sustainable employment."
"(GA) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank President Barroso for coming here and answering questions openly, honestly and eagerly."
"Unfortunately, President Barroso was accused of not being democratically elected and of bullying the Irish into submission."
"I would like to tell Mr Farage that he certainly was not democratically elected to speak on behalf of the Irish, and his use of the word 'bully' was also unfortunate because, for 700 years, Ireland was known as John Bull's other island, when John Bull - namely England - tried to bully the Irish into submission."
"Thankfully, that day is now over so I will go on to my question."
"With the new competences which the Lisbon Treaty gives to the European Union, would President Barroso consider giving one Commissioner exclusive responsibility to bring forward new proposals and new measures to enact these competences?"
"President of the Commission. - I am sorry, I did not understand the question very well because, if you are suggesting having a new Commissioner for all the new competences of the Lisbon Treaty, no, I certainly do not think this is reasonable because they are in so many different areas that we cannot ask one person to have all these competences."
"Now I have already announced, answering a previous question, what I think will be some of the innovations in terms of the portfolios."
"There may be some more;"
"I am working on it."
"This is, after all, an interactive work with the Member States too."
"For instance, Ireland has not yet designated a possible Commissioner."
"I did this five years ago, and this is an interactive process where I also need to see the people that those Member States have put forward in order to form the Commission."
"I will certainly do my best to find competent people - men and women (and I am saying this also for Ireland!) - so that we can, in the end, have a college of committed Europeans who are competent and experienced in all fields, from economy, general politics, energy, environment, justice, fundamental rights and so forth: a huge set of competences for which we need a very able group of people."
"This is the first time Parliament has had this question-and-answer session with the President of the Commission, so thank you very much once again, President Barroso."
"As this was a special event for us, would you care to make a few general comments about this first question-and-answer session?"
"President of the Commission. - Thank you very much, Mr President and all the distinguished Members of this Parliament, for this exercise."
"I really enjoyed it."
"I think it is a good exercise."
"I have to tell you very frankly that it is extremely difficult for me to compress all my arguments, or at least my main arguments, into one minute, especially because most of the time I am not speaking my own language."
"I am speaking in languages that I believe are more accessible and that requires an additional effort from me."
"Anyway, you decide the format."
"I can discuss it with you because I believe that free, confrontational and controversial debates are a good contribution to a stronger European democratic space."
"(Applause)"
"That concludes the item."
"Draft general budget 2010 (Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX) - Draft general budget 2010 (Section III) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr Surján, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section III - Commission (C7-0127/2009 - and on the letter of amendment No 1/2010 (SEC(2009)1133) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 and"
"the report by Mr Maňka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010"
"Section I - European Parliament"
"Section II - Council"
"Section IV - Court of Justice"
"Section V - Court of Auditors"
"Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee"
"Section VII - Committee of the Regions"
"Section VIII - European Ombudsman"
"Section IX - European Data Protection Supervisor"
"(C7-0128/2009 -."
"Mr President, I am going to speak in my mother tongue because, ceterum censeo, I am also protesting against any kind of law restricting the use of a person's mother tongue."
"The 2010 budget is being drafted in the shadow of the financial crisis."
"State Secretary, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all have to cope with this crisis in some manner or other."
"The crisis has sown uncertainty among investors, made it more difficult to obtain credit, increased unemployment and reduced production."
"Is the European Union able to respond to this?"
"Does it have something to say on the dangers caused by climate change or on terrorism?"
"Is it able to protect the EU's borders?"
"Is it welcoming refugees with an equitable approach?"
"Parliament would like to have a budget that responds in the affirmative to all these questions, and Parliament is fairly united in this desire."
"There are no major differences dividing political groups."
"I would therefore, as rapporteur, like to thank all the political groups in Parliament for this."
"However, there is a serious difference of opinion between the Council and Parliament."
"Because of the crisis, the Council would like the smallest budget possible, which is understandable looking at it from the point of view of national parliaments and governments."
"However, we in this House believe that Parliament has a huge number of instruments available that should be made to work even more efficiently, more smoothly and with greater impact, precisely so that we can overcome the crisis."
"What does all this mean in actual figures?"
"Earlier, when we were thinking about 2010, it was with a seven-year budget in mind."
"A decision was then made which would allow, in the current situation, a budget of EUR 134 billion in terms of payment levels."
"On the other hand, the Council is thinking of a figure of EUR 120 billion, while Parliament does not regard the expenditure of EUR 134 billion as being realistic, is taking into account national governments' problems and will end up proposing EUR 127 billion if the vote on Thursday is guided by the recommendation from the Committee on Budgets."
"We must, of course, ask what sense is there in making promises intended for a seven-year cycle in a five-year cycle if we are never going to keep those promises."
"This is actually the situation we are in because every year, the annual budget is much smaller than we discussed the time before."
"However, there is also an even bigger concern."
"Annual budgets also feature commitments, many of which remain unfulfilled."
"We are already lagging more than one annual budget behind, with this gap increasing from one year to the next."
"Therefore, raising the payment levels is an absolute must."
"Otherwise, we will seem to have the same scenario as in every other year: the Council chips away at the Commission's draft, while Parliament suggests even larger figures."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the situation is not entirely like this."
"These proposals have not come about from one line to the next, in a mechanical fashion, snipping indiscriminately here and there."
"As a result of the crisis, everyone needs to tighten the purse strings."
"This is why, for certain purchases, we supported the Council's more economical figures in the Committee on Budgets."
"Elsewhere, for instance, on the matter of staff assigned to particular tasks, we also took into account how the given task was executed."
"At the same time, it is very easy to make mistakes in this area."
"If we have made mistakes, we do not want to prevent the programmes from being implemented."
"If such an event occurs during the year, we will always be prepared to rectify the situation, but we advocate correct implementation and accurate planning."
"We must analyse whether the money that was spent yielded the benefit we were expecting and whether we achieved the objective we set ourselves."
"For example, it is difficult to be satisfied with the communications policy, but there may also be, of course, many more reasons, which are also much more complicated, to explain the lost referendums and the low electoral turnout."
"For this reason, it would be a mistake to reduce the resources for communications."
"We suggested establishing some reserves for certain lines, which can easily be released at the time when, based on current analyses, a promising communication strategy is being prepared."
"We must also look more closely in the future at the extent to which our objectives have been achieved."
"The European Court of Auditors recently published a survey on the successes and struggles of the dairy sector."
"Parliament is expecting the Commission to outline in the imminent Amending letter how the Milk Fund is going to work."
"We think that it also requires a separate budget line and a reserve of an appropriate amount."
"A legal basis must be created which takes into account the Court of Auditors' observations and which will successfully help resolve the sector's current problems."
"Therefore, it is not only about money, but also about the European Union providing better and more specific support to this sector."
"This is why I am calling on my fellow Members to try with the least possible disagreement to vote for a good, effective budget."
"It goes without saying we will have debates on this."
"It is only natural that each political group will also promote their views and seek to raise their profile."
"However, we will agree on the most important matters."
"In the case of the Milk Fund too, the fund itself is much more important than even how much money it will ultimately contain."
"The Committee on Budgets has submitted a proposal for a manageable amount. Thank you for your respectful attention."
"It is precisely now, in a time of crisis, that we must prove to the public and prove to ourselves as well, that when it comes to achieving our political goals, we will use all resources in the most effective way possible."
"Most institutions create their budgets on the basis of previous years."
"After all, what could be easier than multiplying last year's budget by the rate of inflation?"
"When we repeat such a budgeting process year after year, however, it can lead to deformations, inaccuracies and the wasteful use of resources."
"Our aim is therefore to ensure that budgets are created on the basis of real needs."
"In every institution, budget requests must correspond to a real need for tasks to be performed."
"Every institution and every unit of every institution must make every effort to achieve savings."
"This may require better organisation of work, the redeployment of existing resources to focus on priorities or reduced levels of bureaucracy."
"In my previous speeches to the committee, and also in plenary sessions, I have mentioned many examples of recent successes in uncovering reserves."
"We will uncover even more shortcomings and we will make the work of the individual units and institutions even more efficient if we go about it in a systematic way."
"The budget for 2010 establishes this systematic approach."
"The honourable Members who were here in the last Parliament will remember that we always tried to improve cooperation between institutions."
"There have always been reserves here and many of them have even increased over recent years."
"We have a common pot of funding."
"If we all manage just our own corners and close ourselves off against others, we will not communicate and cooperate and it will be difficult to make effective use of our resources."
"It is for this reason that we decided in the Committee on Budgets to implement a horizontal reserve of 5% across all institutions in respect of external translations."
"How else can we motivate institutions first to make use of their spare internal translation capacities and not to turn automatically to external providers?"
"Our aim in all of these areas is to make the spare capacities of every institution available to other institutions."
"Expenses for the purchase and rental of buildings form one of the main administrative expense items of the institutions."
"In 2005, the total floor space of the buildings used by institutions in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasburg exceeded 2 million m2."
"Buildings were not always purchased in the right place, at the right time or for the minimum cost."
"According to the Court of Auditors, the institutions do not cooperate in these areas and even fail to assess their own policies."
"If we are purchasing a new building and we do not have more than one alternative in the bag, then it is difficult for us to achieve advantageous terms."
"For this reason, we are expecting from the Presidency of the European Parliament by the end of the year an appropriate long-term strategy on assets and buildings which will also take account of renovation requirements and security costs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we are to work in a responsible and efficient manner we need comprehensive information on what resources are available to us."
"I would therefore like to emphasise the need to create an information management system."
"With the help of such a system, our work will be coherent and efficient."
"The administration is expected to submit a presentation on this project to the Committee on Budgets in the near future."
"None of the draft budgets of the institutions include costs related to the Lisbon Treaty coming into effect."
"When the Treaty enters into effect, we will have to look very carefully at reorganising existing resources before anyone submits a request for additional resources."
"If staff at any of the institutions achieve financial savings through work efficiencies, the Committee on Budgets will no longer have a problem with allowing such resources to be used for the other priorities of the institution."
"On the other hand, if an institution achieves savings due to unforeseen events, such savings should, as a rule, be returned to the taxpayer."
"I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Budgets for giving their unanimous support to the proposal."
"I firmly believe that the budgetary system of the EU must be developed in such a way as to give precedence to resourcefulness and innovative solutions."
"Mr President, honourable Members, young people - I see that the future of Europe is sitting up there in the gallery - it is a great honour to be present here today at the debate on Parliament's first reading of the budget for 2010."
"Europe is going through its worst economic crisis since the Second World War."
"Jobs are being lost, unemployment is rising and there are record deficits in our public finances."
"Budgetary discipline and sound economic management can accelerate the turnaround."
"The right structural policy can strengthen the upturn that we hope is on the way and make it more sustainable."
"In view of this, the Council unanimously agreed a well-balanced budget that invested resources in education, research, infrastructure, cohesion, responsible public finances and margins for unforeseen events; in other words, all the factors that we know to be important for growth and prosperity."
"Major issues remain."
"Financing is required for the European Economic Recovery Plan and for support for the dairy sector."
"Yet at this time, when Europe's public finances are the worst in living memory, Parliament's Committee on Budgets is proposing that the payments be increased by 10% - by 10%!"
"Can you name me a single other area, apart from the costs of unemployment, in which we would allow such an increase?"
"Despite significant budget deficits - 8% of GDP in France, 6% of GDP in Germany, 14% in the United Kingdom and in Ireland - the Committee on Budgets thinks that the Member States should finance greater expenditure and more administration."
"It wants financing for administration!"
"I am particularly concerned that such a high level of expenditure will make it more difficult to finance the Economic Recovery Plan."
"I am also particularly concerned that the Committee's proposal contains no contingency whatsoever for unforeseen events."
"We must agree on a budget that the Member States can afford and that we can justify to our people."
"We must agree on the Economic Recovery Plan, which is of the utmost importance for Europe's development."
"In view of the agreement that we reached in April, I am confident that we will succeed in this."
"We will need to resolve the complex dairy issue."
"Bearing in mind the excellent cooperation that we have enjoyed to date, I am sure that we will be able to resolve even this complex issue in the difficult situation and predicament in which we find ourselves."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you today before you finalise your first reading of the 2010 draft budget with Thursday's vote."
"I would like, first of all, to thank Parliament for restoring the preliminary draft budget in many areas."
"The Commission very much welcomes Parliament's focus on using the budget as a tool to overcome the current crisis by enhancing economic growth, competitiveness, cohesion and job protection."
"The Commission also welcomes the inclusion, in Parliament's first reading, of the Amending Letter requesting increased spending, notably for Palestine, climate change and accompanying measures in favour of ACP countries."
"Turning to the core issues of the present budget procedure, the Commission has fully understood that Parliament regards the financing of the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan as a priority."
"Let me tell you that this is a priority for the Commission too."
"From that point of view, I understand the logic behind the European Parliament's so-called 'asterisk amendment' on the Recovery Plan going beyond the current expenditure ceiling."
"Next week, the Commission will present a package to address the needs related to the Recovery Plan with a view to reaching an agreed solution at the November conciliation."
"At this stage, the Commission has not yet identified all the sources of financing corresponding to the full amount for the energy projects required by the recovery Plan in 2010."
"However, the Commission will endeavour to identify all possible availabilities with a view to closing any outstanding gap in time for the November conciliation."
"The Commission is concerned about the current difficulties in the dairy sector and we have taken due note of Parliament's proposal to create a special 'Milk Fund' and of the stance taken by the ministers of agriculture."
"In line with the proposal made yesterday by my colleague, Marianne Fischer Boel, next week's Amending Letter to the 2010 budget will propose that EUR 280 million be dedicated to help address the immediate consequences of the crisis for milk producers."
"This new proposal has an impact on the initially envisaged financing of the gap for the EERP but, as I said, the Commission will deploy all efforts to eventually find the necessary resources in time for the conciliation meeting."
"Now I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues where Parliament's first reading gives rise to concerns."
"The European Parliament is proposing an overall increase of nearly 10% in the level of payments compared to 2009, which is some 4% above the level proposed by the Commission."
"While I share the wish of the European Parliament to support economic growth through the EU programmes, we should also take into account the amount of payments that can be reasonably executed without undermining sound financial management."
"The Commission has no reason at this stage to depart from the estimates made in its preliminary draft budget."
"Concerning the administrative support lines of spending programmes, the so-called 'BA lines', I understand the wish of the European Parliament to take a quite restrictive approach in the current circumstances."
"But it is also important to provide the appropriate administrative means for managing growing financial envelopes of programmes if we want this budget to be adequately executed."
"The Commission hopes there will be the opportunity to redress this issue in the second reading."
"Parliament has also voted a number of reserves which, if maintained in the final budget, will have an adverse effect on budget execution."
"The reserve on salaries, if maintained in the course of the year, would have an adverse effect on recruitment of new officials in 2010 to replace personnel leaving the Commission."
"Let me conclude by assuring you that, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, the Commission will give its position on the amendments adopted by Parliament in early November through the so-called 'letter on executability' and I hope Parliament can take it into account in its second reading."
"The Commission will continue to act as honest broker and will do its utmost to help pave the way for a successful outcome to this budget procedure, bearing in mind that the financing of the second tranche of the EERP represents a real challenge for which all efforts should be heading in the same direction."
"I count on your support for achieving a satisfactory and balanced result there."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, I am honoured to speak on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Year after year, we see how Section IV of the budget is severely underfunded."
"Year after year, we also see that, as the year progresses, the Commission and the Council have to resort to a variety of specific measures which are not in tune with regular budgetary methods in order to finance the needs which we all knew were there right from the beginning."
"The situation in Palestine is, unfortunately, one of the best examples of this."
"Having said that, I do note some positive elements."
"I see that the Baltic Sea Strategy got some extra money."
"I also see that the appropriations have been increased for a number of specific policies in favour of democracy and human rights."
"I want to conclude by saying that, especially for the year 2010, we will need to pay attention to the fact that probably - and hopefully - the European External Action Service will start to operate."
"We will need to provide the necessary funds for that."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Madam President, I do not want to ask for the budget to be bust; all I want to ask is that we meet the commitments we have given to the developing world."
"Eleven million children die every year in the developing world."
"These are people who are hit not just by the financial crisis, in the way we are, but by the fact that they do not even get the remittances - which were greater than the financial assistance we gave them - from their families living in the developed world because they, too, are suffering."
"These people are suffering doubly: they are also suffering from the consequences of climate change."
"All I want us to do is to meet our commitment to these people."
"If our GNP goes down a percentage, our contribution to these people also goes down."
"So let us meet the percentage contribution we said we would make."
"Clarity in the budget line, so that we can measure here in Parliament that you are meeting those commitments, and additionality are absolutely central to this."
"Please, in all of this, do not ask the poorest people in the world to carry a burden they are not able to carry."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgetary Control has delivered an opinion containing a number of suggestions."
"I will present three of them to you in one minute."
"The first concerns research, in particular, the sixth and seventh framework programmes."
"For the sake of legal certainty, it is advisable, Commissioner, for the European Commission to refrain from recalculating financial statements for projects that have already been approved and settled, by applying new interpretations of the eligibility criteria."
"We would again ask the Commission not to deviate from the common nationally and internationally acknowledged and certified accounting and calculation methods."
"The second point is the inclusion of EU staff pensions in the budget."
"We propose that the claims against Member States in respect of staff pensions, estimated at EUR 37 billion at 31 December 2008, be entered in the accounts as an asset."
"We also suggest that the budget include the exact amount of these pensions, and not just the amounts paid, as the latter do not take account of the amounts paid into future pensions."
"I would reiterate the proposal for a study on the creation of a Community pension fund, and we also support the Anti-Fraud Office, which must be strengthened so that it can carry out control activities outside the Union."
"Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have worked to increase the budget for the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, which has increased by 13.5% from 2009."
"In particular, the chapters on External Borders, Return, Visa Policy, Free Movement of People and Fundamental Rights and Citizenship have increased."
"The chapter on Justice in Civil and Criminal Matters, in particular, has increased by 4.7%."
"However, the chapter on Security and Safeguarding Liberties has increased by 95% as a result of the integration of Europol into the Community budget."
"This is therefore something new compared to the 2009 budget."
"We adopted an amendment to increase the FRONTEX budget, sending a clear message of commitment to managing the phenomenon of immigration and all aspects of migratory flows in a way that respects human rights."
"Finally, I think that it should also be pointed out that in committee, we adopted a budget amendment of EUR 5 million to facilitate the integration of nationals from third countries."
"Therefore, the section under Title 18 on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice has increased to EUR 105 million, which will help to strengthen the administrative and financial management of the Member States."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety takes the view time and again - this year included - that the funds provided in the European budget absolutely do not suffice to provide effective environmental programmes, to maintain our biodiversity and for a fight against climate change that has a chance of succeeding."
"The fact that the Council makes even further cuts from these meagre funds is as incomprehensible as ever."
"That is why 'back to the preliminary draft budget' is the standard response."
"There are two things that we must impress on the Commission."
"The first of these is that we expect it to immediately include what are known as the 'assigned revenues' for those agencies that are partly dependent on fees - such as the European Medicines Agency in London or the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki - in the preliminary draft budget and not to achieve an artificial margin by omitting them."
"The second point is that we expect the Commission to bring forward a proposal as soon as possible for how it will fund the anti-smoking campaign Help in future after the tobacco fund has run out."
"You see, it is the same every time."
"Madam President, there is cut-throat competition in the world today."
"Developing countries now account for 20% of the world's wealth."
"In 15 years' time, they will account for 34%."
"In 2025 - in other words, in 15 years' time - China and India will together account for 20% of global investments in research and development."
"While these investments are being made outside Europe, bureaucracy is stifling the research institutions, universities and industry of Europe."
"We are facing three crises that must be resolved simultaneously: the climate crisis, the employment crisis and the financial crisis."
"The response to these crises by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is that we must invest in research and innovation."
"Both the Council and the Commission have agreed that this is a priority - in the Lisbon process, in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"In practice, however, their idea of prioritising is to implement cuts of 7%."
"All I can say is that I am grateful that the Council is not 'prioritising' these incredibly important areas still further!"
"This is Orwellian Newspeak and it is unacceptable."
"We need more resources to be allocated to research and development."
"We must work together to reduce bureaucracy."
"We would like to see the Council and the Commissioner for Science and Research focusing on this."
"Above all, we demand that vigorous efforts be made in respect of research and innovation."
"It is there that jobs will be created and it is there that the future lies for Europe and Europe's competitiveness - not in cuts in this area."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Madam President, compared to the 2009 budget, the Commission proposal for 2010 provides for a moderate increase in the budget lines concerning internal market and customs policy, whereas the amount of money allocated to consumer policy remains stable."
"In the draft 2010 budget, the Council has decreased the money, in particular, for budget lines which concern the development of the internal market."
"I believe that a functioning internal market in these times of economic crisis can contribute to the economic recovery."
"In the area of customs policy, the budget will assure cooperation and coordination measures, thus reinforcing security and protection of external borders, supporting the fight against illicit trafficking and fraud as well as improving the efficiency of customs systems."
"I consider measures in the area of consumer education a priority, in particular, the strengthening of financial literacy."
"The crisis has shown how important consumer policy, in particular, consumer education, is, in order to help consumers take responsible economic decisions."
"For all these reasons, the IMCO Committee called for a separate budget line on the SOLVIT programme to be financed by an amount of EUR 1 million."
"SOLVIT is a very good example of how you can help businesses and citizens."
"Finally, for the continuation of the pilot project monitoring measures in the field of consumer policy for the consolidation of a scoreboard and related market study, as a preparatory action, the amount adopted is EUR 1 million."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - Madam President, for 2010 we need a budget harnessing effectively all European policies to pull the European economy out of the crisis, while at the same time preserving our long-term objectives and commitments, which are sustainable growth, economic and social cohesion, and our obligations vis-à-vis the external world, including candidate countries."
"In the draft budget, the Council has automatically cut 36 lines on administrative expenditure, among other lines accompanying the instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA)."
"The argument used, which is low absorption, is not justified as the necessary framework for the implementation of IPA could only be completed in July 2009."
"From 2010 onwards, the European Commission must appraise and approve a significant number of large projects for which it will need to employ significant numbers of people to provide external short-term technical expertise."
"2010 will also be the year when the effective implementation of operations will start, requiring the performance of ex ante controls by the Commission on extensive numbers of tenders and contracts."
"The budget cuts mean that the sound financial management of pre-accession assistance is put in real danger, with all its political dimensions."
"We should therefore remain open to reacting positively to the request from the European Commission to restore the PDB level in this respect."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the budget for the Committee on Agriculture I would like to thank the overall rapporteur, Mr Surján, for his constant willingness to talk in order to find a compromise."
"This is necessary as European agricultural policy is, at present, the only policy area where responsibility lies fully at the Community level."
"It is right that the funds for school milk, school fruit and a few other projects have been increased."
"Stockpiling and export refunds, however, were even being labelled as yesterday's tools two years ago."
"At this moment, they are indispensable tools to overcome the crisis on the markets."
"We are therefore calling for an increase of approximately EUR 81 million for stockpiling from 2009 to 2010 and of approximately EUR 440 million for export refunds and we will be voting in favour of these."
"Nonetheless, this is actually too little at this time."
"As before, I would, of course, have preferred EUR 600 million when it comes to the dairy fund."
"The EUR 300 million that we are now calling for for 2010 is what is absolutely necessary and I ask that this money be fixed in the budget on a permanent basis as the dairy fund."
"That would be the right signal to send, and also an important one."
"The situation on the agricultural markets is drastic."
"The Commission has put its hopes in self-regulation for far too long."
"The agricultural markets, too, need budgetary and general policy frameworks and rules."
"Madam President, thank you very much to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Budgets for accepting all of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries."
"What is particularly important for us is the amendment calling for greater flexibility in the funding granted to Regional Advisory Councils on fishing."
"As well as being scarce, the funding is so subject to interpretations and to the discretion of the Commission that the Councils are prevented from spending even the little that they have; this request was made to us unanimously by the seven existing councils."
"One amendment that we consider particularly opportune calls for a comprehensive strategy to combat piracy that genuinely considers the situation of fishing boats, which are particularly vulnerable to these acts in all the world's waters."
"With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme, as in previous years, we have demonstrated prudence and asked that, now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget, at least the percentage of investment should not decrease, as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species, especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission and the Council, why are the Council's cuts, which we have to implement every single year in different policy areas, so stupid, so wrong and so short-sighted?"
"The answer is because they are not oriented towards the common European interest, and that is what I criticise from a political standpoint."
"You, as the Council, and the Member States are also encompassed by common European responsibility, and our European expenditure is expenditure for our common European interest."
"It is absolutely incomprehensible that the funding for training and education could be cut at this point."
"One of our most successful programmes is the student exchange programme that enables our young people to study in Europe, to get out into the world."
"Why are you cutting back on that?"
"We need to do more for culture, cultural exchange and town twinning because these make Europe real and generate acceptance of Europe from the bottom up."
"And how can we cut back on the communications policy, where we have agreed that there is a need to really let the voters and the citizens know about the European Union's positive achievements?"
"I can only observe, regrettably, as has been said already, that this type of cuts is completely counterproductive from a political point of view."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to emphasise two points today."
"The first is the question of implementing supervision structures at European level."
"In the wake of the crisis, or during this crisis, everyone understands that the Union must equip itself with structures that will enable it to supervise the banking, insurance and securities markets."
"At the end of the last parliamentary term, we reached an agreement with the Council that focused on certain sums for the authorities that were supposed to prefigure those that we are putting in place today."
"However, the draft budget as it stands does not comply with this political agreement, which was concluded under the previous Parliament."
"I hope that the amendments that have been tabled again are adopted so that we are in line with this political agreement, which was concluded so as to ensure that the Union finally equips itself with supervisory authorities."
"Moving on, I would like to emphasise the issue of fiscal policy."
"Fiscal policy tools have been cut even though there is an international call for more governance in fiscal matters."
"If we really want to combat tax havens, the Union must also equip itself with the resources to conduct this policy consistently."
"We will not send out the right message by reducing the Commission's competence in this area."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - Madam President, it has become quite evident in the last few years that the institutions of the European Union are much less familiar to the citizens of Europe than should be the case."
"The European Union is a democratic body, so that contact with the citizens is in the interests of both."
"What the European Union does, and why, should be fully known to the citizens."
"The citizens are stakeholders in what is done by the EU, and clearly the European Union is a stakeholder in European public opinion."
"There are various ways of ensuring that this mutual interest is given expression."
"Communication is one of these, and an important one, and it is for this reason that the budget should include an element devoted to the communication of its activities by the European Union to the wider public."
"On behalf of the Equality Committee, I would like to draw your attention to just one issue during the one minute I have available."
"This is to do with the European Institute for Gender Equality and its funding."
"Based on Parliament's codecision, we established the Institute in 2007 in Vilnius."
"One might think the time that has elapsed since then would have been sufficient for the Institute to have become operational."
"Unfortunately, the situation is much more serious than this."
"The Institute currently has just a director and an assistant."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the rapporteur, Mr Surján, for having taken into account that the Equality Committee was making a wise suggestion when it said the budget could not be automatically slashed based on this year's income, because if we did this, the Institute would not be able to get up and running in the future."
"We not only need to guarantee the rising staff expenditure in the future annual budget, but we must also establish a reserve for the amount allocated to its activities so that the Institute can fulfil its role."
"Madam President, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to react to the surprising publication of a draft Commission communication on the budgetary review."
"The Commissioner will tell us whether this is an inadvertent error."
"However, I should like to issue a warning."
"Although it not does include any figures, the very innovative, and at times provocative, content of this text seems inappropriate for a Commission at the very end of its term of office and for a mid-term review of the multiannual agreement signed in 2006."
"The President of the Commission must therefore clarify, as a matter of urgency, his timetable in relation to the financial proposals that he plans to make, under both the outgoing Commission and the new College."
"Changing the budgetary and therefore political priorities does not come under the management of current business."
"The Committee on Budgets will be ready for the debate, but on the basis of proposals coming from a Commission that is fully legitimate, that is armed with a five-year mandate, and that is ready to assume its political responsibility when it comes to initiatives with this kind of scope."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely on the budget that Parliament can and should bring to bear all of its power as an institution directly elected by the citizens, in order to ensure that this vital instrument for growth, and also for fairness and justice, is fully able to meet citizens' needs."
"The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic, to listen and to respond."
"We have worked towards making the 2010 draft budget as flexible as possible at this time of particular economic and financial crisis."
"However, the budget must also be credible, feasible and tangible, and in this regard, it was fundamental to avoid making financial resources for the coming years too inflexible by restricting excessive spending beyond the maximum expenditure ceiling contained in the perspectives of the multiannual financial framework just to cases that really are an absolute priority."
"This is the case with the Recovery Plan."
"Again with the same aim, namely establishing a budget truly able to meet citizens' needs, we have formulated specific amendments regarding payments in order to free up the maximum amount of resources possible with immediate effect."
"The European budget is structured on two tracks: commitments and payments."
"The commitments represent serious political intentions, but also real, concrete actions."
"Therefore, payments have been increased to EUR 127 billion in line with the draft budget tabled by the Committee on Budgets, compared with EUR 120 billion proposed by the Council and EUR 122 billion proposed by the Commission."
"Still with the same aim, with the same political approach, as a group we are strongly opposed to the creation of reserves, which are not genuine resources immediately available to citizens."
"The policy of establishing reserves at times of crisis should be reduced to the absolute minimum, to cases in which a reserve really is technically indispensable."
"In times of crisis, there is no point merely writing figures in the budget, but instead we should build a useful budget, immediately ready for action."
"Other matters also deserve special attention."
"As a group, we have taken the important responsibility of re-tabling the amendment to increase the milk fund to EUR 600 million, as decided by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and therefore with the participation of all the Members and groups, and also re-tabling an amendment for a microcredit project amounting to EUR 37 million which, and this is extremely important, does not jeopardise the implementation of other programmes under heading 2."
"There is a particular risk at times of crisis: that budget resources will not actually be increased, but transferred from one budget line to another."
"It is to counter this risk that Parliament, as a directly elected institution, with a role different to that of the Council and the Commission, must be especially careful in its actions, not least with regard to scrutiny."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Surján for his sterling work in keeping the different elements of this budget process together."
"People are now saying that many of the Member States are having great difficulties with their public budgets, and that we should therefore rein in on spending too."
"That is true, but there is no public budget more controlled than the EU budget."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets."
"We support the draft budget put forward by Mr Surján."
"For us, the funding of the investments under the recovery plan in energy and climate policy and the focus on research and innovation were the most important priorities for the 2010 budget."
"That is also the way we want to see the EU budget go in future - in other words, that we should concentrate on these areas."
"We think it is a poor state of affairs that neither the Commission nor the Council has indicated where we are to find the money for these investments in the recovery plan - investments that not only we here in Parliament, but also the Heads of State or Government of the EU, support."
"It is appalling that we have to see this acted out time after time when expenditure can be indicated but no decent funding can be found for it."
"We therefore support Mr Surján's proposal to review the Multiannual Financial Framework and look at whether the money for energy investments can be recovered from unused funds within the agricultural budget."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe also supports the proposal to allocate EUR 300 million to a dairy fund to cushion the current crisis for dairy producers."
"We share the view that the crisis is serious and must be tackled."
"Personally, I am not a supporter of the new fund as the Commission does already have tools to help the industry and has also earmarked nearly EUR 0.5 billion for the purpose."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to earmark EUR 600 million for a dairy fund over and above this half a billion. In this regard, I believe that the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets - the EUR 300 million - is an expression of a more realistic solution."
"This draft budget removes a number of the Council's savings and provides a more realistic assessment of the needs for payments in the coming year, and the multi-annual agreement has proven itself to be more a rigid and inflexible framework, in particular, in relation to category 1a, which includes research, education and transport, and category 3, which includes legal and asylum policy and culture and information policy, as well as external affairs policy, while the ceiling for category 4 is chronically far too restrictive."
"I would also like to thank Mr Maňka for his work on the budget for other institutions."
"Parliament's budget remains within the 20% for total administrative expenditure in the EU, and that despite taking on the expenditure for Members' compensation under the new Statute for Members."
"Our group believes that we should be careful of excessive increases in the allocation for political parties, but we have agreed to the draft that is on the table, and I would also like to thank Mr Maňka for the fact that he has focused on the expenditure on translation and on Parliament's buildings policy."
"It is high time that we got collaboration between the institutions and a report into Parliament's buildings policy over a number of years. We have been calling for this for a long time."
"Now we may finally see it laid on the table."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking Mr Surján and Mr Maňka for their cooperative efforts, and I would then like to move on to Mr Surján's statement, in which he said that the Council wants, above all, to pass a small budget."
"In our view, that is precisely the wrong direction to take in times of crisis."
"In times of crisis, you have to have the political courage to act and you have to spend more money on the right, sustainable investments for the future."
"We have, after all, an environmental and an economic crisis, and we have a crisis of hunger and poverty in the world."
"If we Europeans want to act correctly, we need to change our political goals."
"We need a transformation to a sustainable society, we need a Green New Deal, and specifically in relation to the Lisbon strategy, we need more sustainable technologies, efficient green technologies, new propulsion systems and, of course, also new materials that are truly environmentally friendly."
"That also means that we need to invest more money in research and development."
"As I have already emphasised on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, we in the European Union need to invest more money in training and education and to educate our young people, our talents, well and better, because we could then be sure that that money would not be misspent but would pay off in the future, both for the individuals in question and also in terms of the success of our economy."
"We must also, however - and this is what makes the Green New Deal a truly all-round challenge - change structural funds policy and make it an environmental tool when it comes to retrofitting buildings and to new and sustainable concepts of mobility."
"We need to change our agricultural policy, which must become more environmental in nature."
"Yet energy generation, too, can play a major role in the rural economy and can take place in an environmentally friendly and ecological way."
"At the moment, I see far too few plans here - but we must push forward with this."
"I will now turn to the arguments about the dairy farmers."
"We Greens take the view that the dairy farmers must be helped at this point."
"It is not enough, however, to just spend the cash - the money must be spent on the right policy in this field."
"We need quotas, and we need good rules, frameworks and regulation."
"If we are to spend this money now - the EUR 280 million that we are debating - it must go direct to the producers and their organisations."
"We also want to redistribute money."
"We do not believe that we should spend EUR 449 million on export subsidies in the dairy sector because what this does is to ruin markets elsewhere, primarily in Africa."
"We propose that the EUR 300 million plus that we are spending on tobacco production should be reallocated and then truly made available to small dairy farmers."
"That would be more ecological and would be much more beneficial to the dairy farmers than what we are doing at present."
"My final comment is on the recovery plan."
"Ultimately, we will only support it at second reading if it is clear that a green and sustainable approach really is being pursued here."
"We want an ecological energy policy, we want broadband in rural areas and we want pan-European electricity networks."
"These things would really be a step towards a future-oriented policy."
"That is what we expect from the negotiations over the coming weeks."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I will be focusing my comments on the Commission budget and I would like to congratulate Mr Surján for everything he has done as the general rapporteur but, in the absence of the coordinator of our group, Mr Bokros, who happens to be in Hungary for a long-term engagement that he was committed to, I am asked to present the group's position today."
"I understand that this is the third different group that I have presented views for in this House since I have been a Member - not that I have changed, just the groups have."
"So the three points I would like to make in the debate today are as follows."
"Firstly, the general situation is a serious one, which has already been indicated in a financial and economic manner."
"Our deficit levels are at historic highs in several Member States, as the President of the Council has indicated."
"Indeed, in some Member States, the debate is not about where the money is going to be contributed but about the levels of cuts which will be needed to bring the expenditure back into line, as it is in my own country."
"Therefore this is a very mixed debate on how we are going to make sure we can make the European Union run effectively."
"Here, however, we will be looking at the budget."
"In terms of the budget that we will be preparing for 2010, it is a budget which obviously is at the beginning."
"We are in our opening gambits, but in our group, we will be looking very clearly at the quality of expenditure - as the Commissioner has said, on expenditure where monies can be reasonably executed and not being in any way excessive in this regard because of the general situation we find ourselves in."
"My last comment relates to the comments made by our Chair in the Committee on Budgets, Alain Lamassoure."
"We must use this occasion - it is the first year of a five-year Parliament - to look ahead."
"We must discover, if we can, from the Commission when we are going to get the mid-term review, how it will be shaped, how we are going to be able to look ahead, not just to the mid-term review, but how we are going to approach future financial perspectives, as Mr Böge laid out in his report in the last Parliament."
"Not least, how we begin to set in train an interinstitutional process that will look at long-term trends and that will enable us to get the right budgetary analysis, because without that, it is really difficult to plan ahead."
"I would like to open with the most positive aspect: on Thursday, we will vote for more than EUR 3 billion in payment authorisations to go to Structural Funds and programmes of a social nature."
"The Council does indeed dispute this policy, believing that we should not ask the Member States for more money."
"I hope the Swedish Minister will forgive me if I say that this point of view shows a shopping list mentality."
"We are living in exceptional times, and I believe that, on the contrary, the Commission, the Council and Parliament should have had the courage to tackle the problem of funding this budget head-on and made it an exceptional budget."
"Even with the expenditure that we are going to approve on Thursday, this will continue to be a budget that skirts around the crisis."
"It is a business-as-usual budget."
"We do not need drops of water in seas of milk."
"What we need is another policy for rural areas."
"We do not just need Structural Funds for our territories, but a European social policy that complements the policies of each of our States."
"What we really need is courage!"
"Today, there are as many people living in poverty - 79 million - as there were at the beginning of the century."
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the standards necessary to tackle climate change."
"The key issue that we need to discuss is financing the European budget and future Financial Perspectives."
"That is the question, and do not tell us that there is no money, because there is; we can go and look for it among the tax evaders, in the taxation of capital gains in the financial markets and in tax havens."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, this problem with the budget is so vital that we, the MEPs, should set an example by making cutbacks."
"I have made proposals about travelling expenses."
"These days, when travelling, an MEP receives his/her salary, expenses for the cost of the journey, the distance travelled and the time wasted."
"This is ridiculous and incomprehensible."
"I hope that on Thursday, we will at least have the decency to review this state of affairs."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, it is unbelievable that in these times of financial and economic crisis, the European Commission proposes an increase of almost 5% for the 2010 budget."
"But what is worse is that, while the Council, at its first reading in July, put forward a reduction of almost 2% on the preliminary draft budget, this Parliament is now proposing an increase of 5% on it."
"The 2010 budget would then end up being over EUR 127 billion in payment appropriations which equates to 1.08% of the EU's gross national income."
"Is this the way this Parliament wants to bring the budget closer to the citizens?"
"It is all very nice to want to subsidise the Special Olympics in Poland and Greece and the European Youth Olympic Winter Festival in the Czech Republic, or even Xacobeo 2010, but our constituents have other priorities in their lives, such as paying their mortgages and giving a reasonable education to their children."
"The daily cost of the European Union for the United Kingdom currently amounts to GBP 45 million per day and the proposed increase will bring it to GBP 50 million or more with the reduction of the rebate."
"Believe me, there are many other priorities in the UK to invest this money in, and now that the European Commission has warned that Britain is in danger of going bust due to its high level of national debt, this country would be happy to have a significant reduction in its EU contributions, and I am sure that other countries would also be happy with a similar reduction."
"Year after year, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us satisfaction that the EU budget has been legally and regularly spent, and I was really concerned at the lack of control over taxpayers' money when I was the chief accountant of the European Commission back in 2002."
"But still, Parliament wants to put more money into the EU coffers."
"Do not count on me ever to vote in favour of any increase in the budget."
"If you want to subsidise projects to fight the crisis, you should find areas where the budget can be reduced."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only in the figures that the crisis shows up, in the falling markets and in the billions of euros spent on propping up the banks and re-initiating our economy."
"It can also be seen in the exploding unemployment figures."
"This crisis can be seen most of all in the very real fears and anxieties of the citizens of the European Union."
"They fear for their jobs and they fear for their pensions."
"Our citizens are worried about climate change, about energy supplies and about the curtailing of their individual rights in the fight against terrorism."
"The EU can make a positive contribution to calming the thoroughly justified fears of its citizens, even if, at present, there is a need for the relevant processes to be made more effective and efficient."
"In this regard, I am primarily thinking of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for example, in the case of Nokia, and of the Solidarity Fund to support the Italian earthquake victims."
"In order for the money from these funds to actually reach those affected, I think it is important both to redesign these processes to be more efficient and to ensure crystal clear oversight, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund must in no way be confused with an EU back-up for the multinationals."
"Europe was a guarantee for peace and prosperity for a long time."
"Let us work together to make sure that it continues to be just that."
"(FR) We are Europe."
"Madam President, honourable Members, Commissioner, due to some slight delays, I will have to leave Parliament very shortly, as my flight leaves in 45 minutes."
"I will ensure that everything that is said is passed on to me."
"It has been a good debate."
"Many good suggestions have been made."
"It is difficult to set priorities, but set them we must."
"As regards research, I can tell Mrs Ek that we are investing 7.3% more in research than in the 2009 budget, which I think is a lot."
"In its proposal, Parliament invests and increases expenditure substantially compared with 2009."
"At the same time, we must bear in mind that the EU is in recession."
"Public finances in the European Union are declining by around 7%."
"That is not something we can ignore."
"The Council is also investing more, but it is also investing more selectively."
"We are investing in measures that will stimulate growth and we are being more restrained when it comes to areas such as administrative expenditure."
"At the same time, we are pleased to see that Parliament is also taking important steps in this area."
"Following today's debate and the discussions that I have had previously with representatives of Parliament, I believe that - together with the Commission - we will be able to reach agreement on a genuinely good budget in the time to come."
"(PT) Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the European Union's budget for 2010 will help us to overcome the economic crisis that we are undergoing at present."
"One of the results of the crisis is unemployment."
"I therefore wish to emphasise and outline the importance of the amendment we have made to reinforce the ERASMUS programme, in order to promote and facilitate the creation of first jobs for young people."
"With regard to Parliament's budget, I am overjoyed that our main proposals have been taken into account, both in the budget itself and in the draft resolution."
"Our goal is excellence in lawmaking."
"We recognise the importance of multilingualism, of course, but we feel that our prime objective is excellence in lawmaking, and to that end, we need to have the necessary resources so that Members can achieve this objective."
"So as to bring about greater transparency and stringency, we have proposed a baseline budget, which should be implemented at the beginning of each legislative cycle."
"We have also proposed reserves for this objective, the transparency objective and the stringency objective, and therefore reserves in the case of the communication policy, for example, where we would like there to be a cost and benefit analysis."
"There should also be reserves to seek to reduce the existing bureaucracy, for example, in contracting assistants, and we want to 'oblige' the Administration to help reduce this bureaucracy."
"We also agree on the property policy, and concur that it should be a long-term policy."
"Finally, my congratulations to the rapporteurs László Surján and Vladimír Maňka."
"Special congratulations are due to the rapporteur, László Surján, for resisting the temptation to be demagogic about the milk fund, for example, and for doing his utmost and not attempting the impossible in order to sell abroad."
"(SV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has criticised the Committee on Budgets for wanting to increase payment appropriations in the current circumstances."
"In practice, this refers to the execution of the EU budget."
"I consider the criticism absurd for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, the Council's finance ministers have always withheld payments to such an extent that large parts of the EU's budget are never executed."
"Instead, large sums are repaid to the Member States as rebates."
"That is absurd, because the commitments in the budget are there to be executed - not to be repaid to the Members."
"We are prepared to fight for this."
"The question therefore arises as to whether the Presidency's policy is actually to make great promises in the form of commitments that are then never executed."
"Secondly, this year, the arguments for this are even stronger than usual."
"We should be increasing the execution of Social Fund measures that concern job creation, skills development and other such measures, for example."
"The Presidency's criticism is directed not just at the European Parliament, but also at the Commission, because most of what we are doing concerns restoring the cuts in the Commission's budgetary proposal that the Council wants to force through and, in addition, focusing on measures for job creation."
"I also note that the Presidency has criticised the fact that the Committee on Budgets is increasing certain administrative appropriations - while the Commission is criticising us for doing the opposite, namely for having accepted some of the Council's cuts."
"Our abiding principle has been to increase those administrative appropriations that are needed to guarantee the execution of important policies - but not otherwise."
"This year's budget debate looks set to become something of a battle between the Council and the Commission."
"As regards the European Economic Recovery Plan, the EU's budget is not of such magnitude as to be able to be used for Keynesian stimulus policy, but it can be used for certain small but strategic matters, such as the Recovery Plan."
"As we now have a high level of unemployment, it can only be a good thing to bring forward investments that were going to be made anyway and that help to bring Europe together into a genuine internal market - such as those relating to energy infrastructure."
"Nonetheless, almost a year after the Plan was launched, we still have no tangible proposals from the Council or the Swedish Presidency concerning where the money is to come from."
"We are open to discussion, but obviously it is pointless to take the money from other priority areas that also contribute to employment, lifelong learning or energy and climate development, for example."
"It is a pity that the minister had to leave as I had a question for him."
"I will ask it anyway and perhaps he will respond by another means."
"The Swedish Presidency has stated that the strategy for the Baltic Sea area is one of its priority issues."
"At the same time, it has not proposed any financing for this strategy."
"I find that surprising, because it means that everything that needs to be done must be financed from other sources that have already been earmarked for other important objectives."
"There will be no net contribution to the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"In view of this, I wonder how the Swedish Presidency can claim that it sees the Baltic Sea Strategy as a priority."
"We want an allocation of EUR 20 million, equivalent to SEK 200 million."
"It is an important contribution."
"(PL) Madam President, as we all know, the most important budget items in the financial year 2010, and an evaluation of the budget, were set out in a resolution of 10 March this year."
"In its resolution, Parliament was highly critical of the tight margins available in most of the headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"It is alarming that in this draft, the Council reduced the initial draft still further."
"The resultant disproportions between the levels of commitments and payments were so great that they contradicted the fundamental principle of prudence."
"I had expected that closer attention, if not the closest attention, would be paid to the economic crisis which we still face, but as can be seen, Parliament is having to fight on its own for the interests of citizens, and to persuade them that Europe is not the source of the problems, but that it might find an effective remedy for them."
"This is why I fully endorse the draft, which includes funds for the implementation of an economic recovery plan, and I think that it should be one of Parliament's priorities."
"However, the cuts introduced by the Council would limit growth and job creation, or simply render them impossible."
"They would also put an end to work on solving our citizens' energy problem."
"In the context of the crisis in agriculture, for example, in the dairy sector, there are no possibilities of extending programmes which would support a growth in consumption of agricultural products, such as by popularising the consumption of milk and fruit in educational establishments."
"Therefore, I think that the draft budget, in its present form, is not capable of achieving the objectives set by the European Union."
"From the few issues which I have mentioned, it can already be seen that there are areas of the EU budget which can overcome the problems we should be solving, but in many places, budget entries are planned historically, as if the present situation and current problems did not exist."
"They do not foresee future challenges, and where they do, they make little attempt to influence them."
"I think that as a Parliament, it is incumbent on us to strive for more dynamic decisions in reacting to problems which appear in Europe, remembering at the same time to be transparent in our management of funds."
"This is what our electors charged us with six months ago."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen."
"We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force."
"What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence?"
"The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget."
"Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe's citizens."
"Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year."
"The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million."
"From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe."
"This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders."
"Europe's Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy."
"Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency."
"Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts."
"In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget."
"(NL) Madam President, the 2010 budget has been drawn up under particular economic and financial circumstances."
"Rapporteur Mr Surján wants to set budgetary priorities, and I very much appreciate that."
"I support him where these concern core tasks of the European Union and lines that are of particular importance to economic recovery."
"However, the overall result too often comes down to spending more money, even though the Council had already made less rigorous cutbacks in the draft budget than in other years."
"I should like to thank Mr Surján explicitly for his open and constructive attitude, which was evident with regard to my amendment seeking improvements in childcare, and particularly deinstitutionalisation."
"This amendment, which concerns the European Social Fund, was adopted with broad support in the committee."
"The European Union and the Member States must help ensure that children from homes can grow up in families as far as possible."
"At a time when we are focusing on economic measures, we must not forget expenditure of great social importance such as this."
"Otherwise, it will be these children who suffer at this economically difficult time, and that is unworthy of the EU."
"(NL) Madam President, the Members of this House often talk of solidarity among Member States; naturally, as it is easy to show solidarity if it is paid for out of other people's pockets."
"The figures for 2008 came out on 23 September."
"Again, the Dutch, more than any other Europeans, feel the extent to which the infamous Europhile dream is eating up their pay slips."
"The Dutch public - the class dunce - is of course the largest net contributor once again."
"Each Dutch citizen pays a staggering EUR 267 to Europe every year."
"The Party for Freedom (PVV), the biggest Dutch party according to the opinion polls, will continue to fight against this."
"It is also a disgrace that the Netherlands is the third largest payer, after Germany and Italy, when it comes to the net contribution for 2008."
"The Party for Freedom wants to ensure that the Dutch public is no longer treated as Europe's cash machine."
"Let there be an end to money for corrupt countries, to the Globalisation Fund and the Cohesion Fund, to the travelling circus and to the left-wing projects, and let us give Dutch bakers, butchers and greengrocers their hard-earned money back."
"After all, it will probably be the case with the 2010 budget, too, that Dutch citizens are left holding the baby and have to dig deep into their pockets, whilst MEPs from 19 out of the 27 countries present here play Santa Claus with other people's money."
"This is termed 'solidarity', but it is theft, pure and simple."
"The PVV would never even dream of adopting a budget for the European Union that would so extremely and disproportionately disadvantage the Dutch public."
"(ES) Madam President, if the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, as we all hope, from January we will have new powers of joint decision regarding the whole budget that will also naturally apply to agriculture."
"Perhaps we will be happier in the Committee on Budgets when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force."
"However, the new powers will also mean new responsibilities."
"These new responsibilities affect all of us, whether we are MEPs, members of the Council or members of the Commission."
"The first of the obligations is to fulfil interinstitutional responsibilities and commitments."
"I am going to mention two of them."
"Firstly, the funding of the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"This is a disgrace."
"We have been negotiating for a year and we have still not been able to secure EUR 5 billion out of an overall European Union budget which this year amounts to more than EUR 130 billion."
"We have not yet been able to find a solution."
"Firstly, we lost a budget surplus from 2008 and now we do not have the funding guaranteed."
"If the Council tries to save on other items, we will find ourselves negotiating at a serious disadvantage, because the previous commitment involved funding the activities of the Recovery Plan with new money."
"The second matter is the Dairy Fund."
"We need to comply with the principles, with the needs for budgetary discipline, which require that a margin be left in Category 2."
"The Council and the Commission have just accepted EUR 280 million."
"I would like to put a question to the Commission, because it is very important that we are sure about what we are going to be voting on in two days' time."
"Do these EUR 280 million that we have accepted, that you have accepted, come from what was not spent in 2009 or can it be assumed that you are making commitments in relation to the money for 2010 that this House has not yet voted on?"
"We believe that this is a question that requires an immediate response from the Commissioner."
"In any case, these EUR 280 million are not part of the Dairy Fund, but rather we are talking about a one-off intervention."
"The Dairy Fund is another long-term intervention that involves restructuring and a financial commitment from the Commission and the Council."
"(DE) Madam President, the congratulations of my group to our rapporteur are all the warmer for the fact that, through the 2010 budget, we have brought about a state of ongoing works."
"It is a snapshot missing significant elements that we will be accruing as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, including obligations that we enter into under the Treaty, so that we work on the basis that we can and must re-visit this budget relatively speedily, even if, at that point, the focus may be more on the argument about Parliament's rights and less on the contents of the budget."
"The President-in-Office of the Council said that there would be a 7.3% increase in funding for research."
"We played our part in attaining that."
"We support it because we need this extra money for innovations and because this is how we will have to earn our money in future."
"At the same time, however, we must also consider the rules according to which we will provide this money and ensure that we do not provide it in such a way that the researchers for whom it is actually intended will no longer be able to access it because they fail to navigate through complicated rules."
"I would therefore like to call, at this point, for greater collaboration between the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control will be discussing two reserves on Thursday that failed to pass in the Committee on Budgets and I would like to ask, as the spokesperson for our group in the Committee on Budgetary Control, that these reserves be approved."
"One of the reserves relates to Commission staffing, specifically in connection with an idea from the Committee on Budgets known as 'staff screening'."
"By this point we are very well informed about 30% of the staff at the Commission, but we know nothing about the other 70%, who are still not covered."
"This reserve is designed to obtain information about the 70% about whom we currently know nothing."
"The second reserve relates to the Financial Regulation."
"At the end of this year, the scheduled revision of the Financial Regulation will take place, and our aim with this reserve is to help the Commission out a little, as we believe that we need simplifications and that we must implement certain proposals in the Financial Regulation."
"I am very grateful to Commissioner Šemeta for the fact that the Commission, under his leadership, has now, for the first time, carried out a consultation amongst subsidy recipients on the subject of 'Obstacles and difficulties in the application procedure'."
"I also want to argue in favour of this reserve as it relates to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"The Commission has been refusing to provide us with a working paper since November last year and in so doing, has obstructed the progress of the consultations about OLAF and its legal basis."
"It is important, therefore, to obtain a majority for these two reserves."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gräßle."
"As you are addressing the Commission directly, I would encourage the Commissioner to listen closely to what you have to say."
"That makes it much easier to answer afterwards."
"(NL) Madam President, I should very much like to contribute from the perspective of the Committee on Regional Development."
"It is this committee that makes the citizen-focused policy that is needed, particularly in the context of the crisis we are seeing at the moment."
"I should like to start by thanking Mr Surján, who has cooperated on responding to good signals."
"In a time of crisis, it is unacceptable for financial arrangements - particularly in regional policy - to be violated and amounts to be reduced."
"It is excellent, in my view, that this is now being set to rights."
"It is necessary to be alert in a time of crisis, and the European Parliament and the Commission have done so in the proposals that were adopted just before the recess."
"We have more flexibility, we can provide our budgets earlier, and we can invest more in energy-efficient buildings and housing, for example."
"I also welcome the additional budgets that have been provided for three pilot projects."
"In recent weeks, representatives of the regions have been meeting at the Open Days in Brussels, and have said that they can put these resources to very good use in enabling better participation in policy in all kinds of fields."
"This is the citizen-focused policy I referred to."
"I have just heard Mr van der Stoep, another Dutch representative, say he rejects these resources."
"Take cross-border language projects, for example: these promote participation by the people, something we are happy to endorse."
"There was one small sticking point, but Mr Surján found a good solution to that, too."
"It has been said in the course of the debate that the Green New Deal should be paid for out of these resources: the regional resources."
"Sustainability policy is an excellent thing, of course, but adopting such a proposal in its entirety would give rise to a great many unrealistic expectations in the regions and also among our fellow Members."
"We have specified in the Structural Funds regulations what can be done in the way of innovation, of sustainability policy and of ecology, and so it is good to include that just by way of example rather than declaring we are going to adapt the regulation to this."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, Madam President, to thank the Committee on Budgets for its work which, with regard to the needs of the farming world, has sought to provide a global framework of resources to resolve the issue of dairy farmers and milk, which is certainly of concern to many European countries today."
"Nevertheless, the need for a minimum margin has prevented us from exceeding EUR 300 million for the milk fund."
"This is nonetheless a robust intervention if these resources, as the Commissioner was asked, are additional resources and envisage, naturally, a package of appropriate measures."
"On the other hand, we have heard some other groups proposing, probably playing in part to public opinion, a far higher figure, albeit in the knowledge that there is no way that these resources can be found, and merely so they can send a certain message to the outside world."
"Allow me also to highlight another budget area which needs adequate attention: long-term buildings policy."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, with the new powers that will be conferred on Parliament, the clear need to strengthen relations with regional parliaments and the new thematic areas, we will need more room in the Brussels offices and so, given that 97% of the current buildings are already occupied, I think that we have to put in place a serious policy for the construction of an even larger European quarter which gives a clear sense of unity to Europe, through an appropriate buildings policy."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I think that, with this budget, we have succeeded once again in developing new strategies."
"I am pleased that the House has decided to support the Small Business Act, at least with EUR 1 million for obligations and EUR 500 000 for payments."
"Commissioner Verheugen has promised that he will use these funds accordingly."
"We have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium-sized businesses."
"Doing so is especially important in a crisis situation, and the SOLVIT programme is also to be significantly reinforced."
"This relates to getting across borders within the internal market, which often represents a very particular challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am pleased that the 'ERASMUS for journalists' programme is finally on the agenda and that 'ERASMUS for young entrepreneurs' is successfully operating."
"(EL) Madam President, although it is commonly accepted that the Structural Funds and the cohesion funds are the spearhead in combating the economic crisis, the Council unfortunately is being contradictory by making cuts to the relevant payment appropriations."
"Unlike the Council and the Commission, we are endeavouring to safeguard adequate financing for the European Economic Recovery Plan by strengthening energy infrastructures and research and innovation."
"At the same time, we need to safeguard the viability of existing Community infrastructures and tools in the civil protection sector, especially by further strengthening the rapid response capacity of the European Union in the event of natural disasters, thereby paving the way for the future creation of a European civil protection force."
"Finally, we need to point out that green development and strengthening research and innovation must be the basic component of the Community budget for a clean and viable environment in all sectors."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"The financial crisis Recovery Plan and the milk crisis have made the budgetary procedure for the coming year very challenging."
"We still face challenges and we await with great interest the Commission's proposal next week for financing the Recovery Plan."
"Important questions have been raised here, some of which relate to the milk crisis."
"For my part, I want to mention just one special matter."
"The economic situation has meant that the Member States are keeping their purse strings tight where it concerns the forthcoming budget."
"Budgetary discipline on the part of the Member States may well be partly understandable in an economic whirlwind, but it is inexcusable that over these past few years, Member States have had to be refunded sums of money out of the Structural Funds budget in the form of unused appropriations."
"The reason for this passivity is the Administration and Control System, which needs simplifying urgently."
"In view of the economic situation, it is extremely important that the Structural Funds are exploited effectively in the outermost regions in order to support recovery measures."
"Madam President, during the economic and financial crisis, Wales benefited from cohesion policy and structural funds under Headings 1a and 1b."
"So, although the recovery plan was welcome and indeed necessary, we must not now cut important lines under Heading 1 to fund the GBP 1.98 billion required."
"I fear that may happen and I also fear that the proposals to do so are part of a wider attack on cohesion policy."
"I refer to the budget review paper produced by the Budget DG, which was referred to by Mr Lamassoure earlier."
"I understand this includes the possibility of renationalising convergence funding, watering down competitiveness and saying 'no' to transitional status for regions coming out of convergence."
"I think Members should resist all this."
"Indeed, I would welcome the views of the Commission on these proposals, because these proposals would damage cohesion policy and damage places like Wales and similar regions."
"(PL) Madam President, we are all aware of the difficult situation we find ourselves in regarding the economic and financial crisis."
"I am therefore particularly glad that the Committee on Budgets and the rapporteur himself have taken a positive view of the amendment on holding the Special Olympics."
"The Special Olympics are, if I may explain, sports competitions for people with intellectual disabilities, enabling them to play a full part in society and giving them the opportunity for self-expression."
"I am very glad it has been made possible to hold the Special Olympics European Summer Games in Warsaw in 2010 and the Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens in 2011."
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to appeal to the Council to look favourably on this financial commitment, and to ask the European Commission for help in practical matters relating to the organisation of this annual event."
"(PL) Madam President, the proposed budget has to be a direct measure in the fight against the crisis."
"One branch of industry which has been affected especially badly as a result of the world crisis is shipbuilding and maritime transport."
"In addition, the European Commission, by its restrictive policy, has contributed to the destruction of the shipbuilding industry in Europe."
"Where Poland is concerned, the European Commission's actions have destroyed its shipbuilding industry and made thousands of people unemployed."
"This way of strengthening the economy strengthens the economies of countries in the Far East."
"Therefore, I would like to make an appeal, and to point out that it is important for next year's budget to provide funds to rescue this industry, that is to say, the shipbuilding industry, throughout Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, the budget for next year also foresees an increase of funds for security and defence."
"This has evoked remarks and reservations from some politicians."
"Such remarks have also been heard during the debate."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a specific question - what will the increased funds for defence be used for?"
"Does this concern a joint mission of some kind, or are these additional funds related to the promotion of new technologies or the promotion of joint military programmes?"
"For if this were so, I think it would certainly be a move in the right direction."
"This is because the Army also generates new technologies, and can create new, modern jobs."
"I would therefore ask for more information on the subject."
"Madam President, recently, the Irish Government decided to scrap the REPS scheme for farmers: that is the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme."
"That scheme, like many more, was cofunded by the European Union."
"I want to know: what happens to the money when it is not utilised by the particular government; whether the same happens in other countries; where this money goes and how is it utilised when it is not used within the country for which it is designated."
"(LT) Firstly, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta, who today, with Parliament's approval, participated probably for the first time in such a debate."
"However, on the matter of the 2010 budget, today we can surely all accept that the situation has changed somewhat since we debated the 2009 budget."
"There really was a lot of talk about solidarity, about solving those problems linked to the current financial crisis."
"To my understanding, the 2010 budget should have been slightly different."
"Whether we want to or not, we still have to consider the real situation which brings us new challenges every day."
"I would like to congratulate Parliament, which very recently in Brussels, a few days ago, unanimously agreed on support for certain states that have suffered from various natural problems."
"I believe that the same sort of problems also exist in some of the other small Member States of the European Union which today lack funding."
"Therefore, I really believe that in future, specific measures should be designed that would allow those states to come out of the financial crisis."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will be very brief."
"First of all, I would like to thank all the Members of the Parliament for their proposals regarding the budget for 2010, and hope that in the further budgetary procedure, we will find proper solutions in order to establish a good budget for 2010."
"I just wanted to respond concretely to this very important issue of milk funds and say that what Mrs Fischer Boel stated yesterday was the commitment by the Commission to come up with a proposal on certain amounts of money, namely EUR 280 million."
"The Commission will discuss this issue next week and we will come up with a concrete proposal on this issue according to the Rules of Procedure."
"These are my brief remarks regarding the discussion."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Šemeta."
"There were a few more questions from the Members, but it is my understanding that you do not want to answer Mr Garriga and the other Members directly."
"Perhaps you would like to get your answers to the Members in question in writing."
"They would certainly appreciate that enormously."
"Mrs Gräßle, Mr Garriga and numerous other Members have asked additional questions."
"rapporteur. - (HU) I would first of all like to address the Council, even though the State Secretary has had to leave."
"I totally agree with his statement that there is a problem."
"I also entirely agree that everything he considers important Parliament also considers important, such as education and research."
"There is also a great deal of consensus on the objectives."
"However, there is a large gap when it comes to the means to be used."
"We somehow have to reach a consensus on this by the middle of November."
"The Commissioner mentioned that he welcomed steps Parliament was taking to restore lines featuring in the Commission's preliminary budget."
"I would ask him to realise that this does not happen in a few lines."
"In fact, I mentioned that we tried to adopt a position using a nuanced approach."
"However, I must mention a few ideas expressed during the debate which I do not agree with."
"I cannot accept the attitude that we describe as theft the amounts being transferred from one contributing country to another beneficiary country as a gesture of solidarity."
"I do not think that this is what the issue is about here."
"The European Union has been built on the basis that members show solidarity to each other."
"In fact, I know of a contributing country whose leaders say that their revenue has substantially increased thanks to enlargement which has granted them access to a huge market."
"The European Union cannot be measured in terms of the ratio of payments to contributions."
"This is spurious and misleading, and it will ruin our whole common future."
"At the same time, I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that some people here very enthusiastically referred to each proposal in the past tense: we raised and arranged it, and this is the way it will be."
"What we will vote on now on Thursday is a draft and a political message."
"The political message is about how this Parliament would like to lead the European Union to greener pastures."
"I also ask the Council to realise that what the rapporteur represents is not an individual's opinion, nor is it the opinion of a party, or only the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"So many people have spoken here from different committees and different political groups, but all with the same message: we need a better, more practical and more powerful budget."
"My time has run out."
"Thank you for your respectful attention."
"I would like to express my thanks for the debate in the Chamber and also for the cooperation in the Committee on Budgets, in the political groups and in the arbitration proceedings."
"I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the European Parliament and all of the representatives of the Directorates-General of the European Parliament; we have been working together since January looking for the best solutions to help us make effective use of the financial resources of Europe's citizens."
"I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators."
"I had the feeling in our discussions that we really were looking for positive solutions."
"It is thanks to you also that we found these solutions and many of them form part of my report."
"I would like to thank my advisers and the staff of the Committee on Budgets."
"The numerous discussions that we had with representatives of all institutions helped us to develop a more objective view of the matter and, more importantly, we discovered where to look for solutions."
"I highly appreciate the agreement from the arbitration proceedings concerning the implementation of an organisational audit of the INFO Directorate-General and of the security services."
"The aim is to assess whether resources are being used in the best possible way."
"In the past, only the Court of Auditors agreed to external inspections of their work - and it paid off."
"Following the audit, the Court of Auditors reduced its administrative costs and achieved higher productivity levels."
"The Committee on Budgets has also worked constructively with other institutions in the past."
"On this occasion, too, we worked together to find the best solutions when creating the budgets of European institutions."
"Where the requests of the institutions were justifiable, we reinstated some of the original requests which the Council had reduced."
"I would like to applaud the method of creating budgets at these institutions, which are already creating their budgets not only on the basis of the inflation rate, but also on the basis of real needs."
"That brings the joint debate to a close."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The draft Community budget for 2010 is much too low given that we are in the midst of an economic and social crisis, with a dramatic effect on employment and the living conditions of many people."
"The fact that it even falls about EUR 6 billion short of what was agreed in the multiannual financial framework for 2010 is unacceptable."
"In view of the serious social reality in many Member States, particularly the so-called 'cohesion countries' like Portugal, we think that the budget should be revised and increased as a matter of urgency, and we have put forward proposals to that effect, including:"
"Greater financial support for structural and cohesion policies;"
"The re-evaluation of the N+2 and N+3 rules which, to date, have meant a loss of around EUR 106 million for Portugal within the previous financial framework;"
"An increase in the rate of Community cofinancing in the structural and cohesion funds."
"It is unfortunate that other proposals with a significant social and environmental impact were not accepted during the budget discussions, including, for example:"
"A development programme for Portuguese industry;"
"A programme for supporting the textile and clothing industry;"
"A programme for supporting small-scale, artisanal coastal fisheries;"
"An increase in funding for the LIFE+ programme."
"in writing. - Following the adoption of Budget 2010 and in light of the positive developments in Ireland concerning the Lisbon Treaty, I believe that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the budgetary procedure aiming to improve the process as a whole and make it more efficient, relevant and visible to European citizens."
"In this regard, I believe that a key goal of the revision must be to enhance transparency in decision making and during the implementation phase."
"For that purpose, we should consider the introduction of uniform control standards and statistical mechanisms across Member States to get higher quality feedback on the budget delivery results."
"Furthermore, the budgetary procedure should incorporate a better balance between long-term stability and flexibility to respond to changing needs, while preserving the principle of subsidiary by providing clear advantages and added value in comparison to national budgets."
"There are also certain policy areas that need to be developed further."
"Europe is facing today significant challenges due to the financial crisis, climate change, energy supply, security and immigration."
"I appreciate the efforts of the Commission in addressing them, but I think we need a stronger, more coordinated and holistic approach in order to be effective."
"Preparing a budget is never an easy process, even less so during an economic crisis."
"However, this is all the more reason why this task is even more important."
"Managing a crisis of the magnitude of the current one also depends at EU level on the balance that exists in the negotiations between the authorised European institutions."
"The European Parliament has undoubtedly a crucial role to play in this debate."
"The main issues at the heart of the discussions on the 2010 budget have been the Economic Recovery Plan and the European Milk Fund."
"These issues have, in a sense, highlighted how rigid the 2007-2013 financial framework is, as they are new financial projects and therefore new money."
"The EU budget needs to make full use of the financial margins to respond to the economic crisis."
"However, this budget is likely to have a limited impact if Member States are not going to adopt an active approach to accessing the available resources."
"We must send out a strong message to the capitals of Europe, and especially to Bucharest, in my case."
"Our efforts here to obtain as much money as possible for the European funds are in vain if, in our home countries, the powers that be do not take the measures required to access and use the funds efficiently."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the fact that the pilot programme for Roma social integration proposed by the European Parliament in 2009 is still included in the 2010 Community budget."
"The European Commission's Directorate-General for regional policy issued an invitation to tender for the programme at the end of July."
"Its aim was to devise original and complex solutions for dealing with the wide-ranging problems affecting Roma communities."
"The explicit objective of the draft is to devise such measures which, based on existing experience, can promote Roma integration through education, social and economic measures, with cross-border cooperation and the sharing of best practices."
"According to the original proposal from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the cornerstone of the programme is, on the one hand, the development of early years education and, on the other, the promotion of self-employment and granting of micro-credits."
"In addition, information and awareness-raising campaigns will also be run in connection with the pilot programme."
"This project will hopefully provide the opportunity to draft the guidelines for a Community action plan, aimed at Roma social integration, and contribute, through the expansion of the ideas that prove to be effective, to the drafting of a regulatory Community action plan, extending beyond the instruments currently available."
"I should like to raise a question which is significant for the economy and employment, and not only in my own country."
"We expect to receive a proposal from the Commission in the near future on the possible extension of current antidumping duties imposed on the importing of footwear with leather uppers from China and Vietnam."
"The positions of individual Member States on this matter are very different."
"In view of the significant levels of employment in the industry, maintaining the current duties is extremely important."
"Extension of existing legislation does not give rise to any objections from a technical point of view."
"I would, therefore, like to ask for an assurance from the Commission that it will base its proposal on the substantive findings of an investigation, while at the same time taking note of the fact that this is an opportunity to verify promises made not long ago by the President of the Commission about protecting jobs."
"in writing. - I welcome the proposal of the draft budget for 2010 as it is a balanced report, taking into consideration in a realistic manner the EU's priorities."
"Two matters are to be highlighted - the increases to payments on the main lines (ERDF, ESF, Cohesion Fund) for regional development, and the creation of a 'milk fund'."
"The increases to payments are important as they will boost the implementation of structural policy in the Member States for the benefit of all European citizens, while the setting-up of a special 'milk fund' would represent a strong signal sent out by the European institutions to European farmers."
"A third key point in the budget is represented by energy policy, an essential area for 2010, as it will be the year of the adoption of a new energy plan for the period 2010-2014 aimed at boosting the EU's energy security and competitiveness."
"In the coming years, the Commission should also consider as a priority investments in infrastructure, especially in the new Member States, as they have a positive effect on economic and territorial cohesion."
"Establishing the Milk Fund would send an important signal to European farmers, highlighting the genuine concern that the EU's institutions show for the crisis the dairy product sector has endured."
"The dairy market is one of the most volatile markets and has been hit hard by the economic crisis we are currently experiencing."
"Such a basic solution as establishing a fund to support the sector's modernisation is patently preferable to a palliative solution, such as a return to the traditional ways of controlling production via milk quotas."
"We would all like to see a larger financial allocation."
"However, the sum being proposed for setting up this fund, which is EUR 300 million, is the maximum amount compatible with the budgetary ceiling."
"If this ceiling were to be exceeded, it would make it impossible for the Council of Ministers to approve the establishment of the fund."
"At the same time, new steps must be taken to boost the use of rural development funds by livestock farmers."
"I believe that the most useful measures would be those linked to information access, the exchange of good practices and providing instruction on how to apply for these funds, which are currently underused in certain Member States."
"Democracy building in external relations (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question by Gabriele Albertini and Heidi Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, to the Council on democracy building in external relations (B7-0213/2009)."
"Madam President, I am delighted that, during its presidency, Sweden has made support for democracy in external relations an important issue."
"From the viewpoint of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I would like to stress that democracy and human rights belong inseparably together."
"This is patently obvious from the different definitions of democracy that exist, and I would like to draw your attention to the fact, for example, that the United Nations attempted to define democracy in 2005."
"The definition contains a long list of items, from a pluralist political system to the rule of law, transparency of government, freedom of the media, and so on. This clearly shows us that human rights cannot be divorced from democracy."
"If it wants to use them, the European Union has a very wide range of resources at its disposal to promote democracy in the world."
"The entire development policy and the Common Foreign and Security Policy cover this whole spectrum."
"The resources available to us are dialogue with other countries, various financial instruments, involvement in international forums and election observation, which are obviously very important to us."
"There are also situations where we have to think about various negative measures."
"I would like to bring to Minister Malmström's attention the fact that next week, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is preparing to discuss the revocation of the ban on the exporting of weapons to Uzbekistan."
"I think that everything indicates that this is quite the wrong signal to send, as Uzbekistan has not really listened to the demands of the international community."
"The international community, including the European Union, requested it to conduct an independent, international investigation into the tragic and shocking events in the spring of 2005 in Andizhan, when democracy was well and truly suppressed."
"I would also like to hear what Minister Malmström thinks about this situation."
"How can we promote democracy when some Member States now want to end this ban on the exporting of weapons?"
"I would also like to say that democracy cannot be exported."
"It is no product for export."
"It does not really work as something brought in from the outside, and that is why I would like to emphasise the importance of including civil society in the process, because that way, democracy grows organically, as it were: from the grassroots of society."
"I would like to mention that Russia is a cooperation partner that systematically refuses to agree to the involvement of NGOs in dialogues on human rights between it and the Union."
"In my view, we cannot accept this situation in the future."
"Finally, I would like to say that support for democracy should be higher up the agenda in the Union's foreign and security policy and development policy."
"It also needs more resources."
"For example, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is very modestly resourced and we should increase its funding."
"Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, democracy and human rights are inextricably linked."
"It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised."
"We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance."
"The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate."
"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this."
"Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock."
"Where is the European Union's consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles?"
"And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report?"
"Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace."
"It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values."
"Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result."
"We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues."
"The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU."
"We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy."
"What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term?"
"What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens?"
"The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive."
"It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level."
"Madam President, honourable Members, in the EU consensus on development, the term 'poverty' is defined with a number of dimensions."
"Poverty means an absence of power, opportunities and security."
"Development is impeded if there is no freedom, and freedom is restricted without democracy."
"It is difficult to have peace without democracy."
"Consequently, there can be no development without peace."
"Both require full respect for human rights."
"These concepts are intertwined and we need a coherent overall framework for better use of existing policies and instruments in support of democracy building."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for its great interest in and support for this work."
"After seven years as a Member, including on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am only too aware of Parliament's wholehearted commitment and real contributions to democracy building within the context of the EU's external relations."
"This initiative, which was launched by the Czech and Swedish Presidencies, has been discussed here previously on a number of occasions, including with my colleague, Mrs Carlsson."
"The starting point of the initiative is that democracy building is a key factor not only in the EU's development cooperation, but also in the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"That is undisputed."
"However, the intention is for the initiative to go one step further."
"As a global player, with 27 Member States and the European Parliament, and as the world's largest contributor of aid, the EU has a key role to play in terms of supporting democracy building in its external relations."
"There is a symbolic dimension to this, since we hope that our successes at home will serve to inspire our partner countries around the world."
"However, it is also intended that the initiative will work at a pragmatic and operational level."
"The aim is to ensure that we fully utilise the instruments at our disposal within the EU's legal and political frameworks and our institutions in a coordinated, effective way."
"We are not starting from scratch."
"We have already achieved a great deal."
"We are experienced in supporting democracy building in our external relations."
"This is a priority area in our relationships with ACP countries - written into the Cotonou Agreement - and with other regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe."
"We have strong rules on human rights that include dialogue with third countries and seven common EU strategies."
"Certainly, there is substantial room for improvement, however."
"We can do more."
"We can do better."
"The essence of democracy demands a new political framework, and the current distribution of labour between the various pillars does not necessarily correspond to the needs that exist."
"Various instruments are used in parallel, and sometimes not very consistently."
"This is undermining the impact of what we are doing."
"It may also affect our visibility and credibility and limit our opportunities for effective cooperation."
"Without therefore inventing new tools or models, we quite simply want to bring about greater coordination and coherence in the way we work on supporting democracy."
"How can we do this?"
"Well, by identifying specific ways of using the EU's instruments more effectively within a uniform framework."
"We can draw inspiration from some of our success stories."
"Our involvement in the Western Balkans is one such example."
"It combines first and third pillar instruments and is, at the same time, oriented towards supporting political reforms, including institution building."
"That is why it is becoming a stable environment for democracy."
"The 'two hats' that the EU's special representative has help to bring about better coordination and coherence between the EU's various instruments."
"We must be humble, however."
"We face substantial challenges in the region."
"I want to make myself clear."
"Some people - perhaps not those of you here - are concerned that this initiative will introduce new conditionality into development aid."
"Naturally, this is a sensitive issue."
"However, talking about human rights and democracy with our partner countries can never embody conditionality."
"Where are we now?"
"The relevant working groups have initiated discussions on proposals for the Council's conclusions, based on various contributions."
"We are building on the work started by the Czech Presidency, which held a special conference on the EU and democracy building."
"I have also seen a very interesting report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance that compares our intentions when carrying out democracy building with how they are perceived by our partners."
"It is too early to assess the initiative, but I want to emphasise that the process is already providing added value."
"Those responsible for development and human rights issues are working together more closely."
"Discussions in the Council working groups on development and human rights are taking place in parallel or at joint meetings."
"That alone is an added value and an important point of the whole initiative."
"We are working towards the Council's conclusions being adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in November."
"One of the proposals being discussed is the need for country-specific approaches that are based on an in-depth analysis of a country's situation and that feed into democracy building at EU level, affecting the choice of appropriate instrument."
"Another proposal is the need for real partnership, based on dialogue and consultations, in which support for democracy is treated as a separate topic and in which various dialogues are more coherent and coordinated."
"The EU's support for election processes around the world is important."
"The Council and the European Parliament are largely of the same view concerning this."
"We share the concern that Parliament sometimes feels as regards the need to 'go beyond the elections'."
"Election support needs to be made part of a continual process that involves following political developments over a long period of time."
"This means we must focus on what is happening in the lead-up to elections, during elections and between elections in order to ensure there are functioning mechanisms for demanding responsibility."
"I cannot emphasise enough the role of our various parliaments - in other words, the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments - in the democracy building process."
"They must be fully involved in the EU's activities."
"I hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will enter into force in the near future."
"These new 'rules of the game' for the Union will bring about a more democratic and effective EU."
"The Treaty will also help make Europe a stronger player on the global stage by establishing the European External Action Service."
"The idea behind this is, after all, to make the EU's external policies more concordant and to bridge the gap between the Commission's and the Council's work so that the policies are moving in the same direction."
"Along with the European External Action Service, the political framework for supporting democracy building will improve so that the EU can provide even better support for developments in various places in the world."
"EU support for democracy building is incredibly important."
"If a democratic state cannot meet its citizens' basic needs and stimulate economic and social development, this will result in dissatisfaction with how democracy works."
"The government then risks losing both legitimacy and political support."
"I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for pushing this issue."
"You contribute through your commitment, through legislation, through your relations and contacts with parliaments around the world and through your participation in the EU's election observation missions."
"For this reason, you are a key force in democracy building, and I hope that the European Parliament will continue to perform this role for a long time to come."
"Madam President, how can one bring democracy to a nation?"
"Well, by relying on and strengthening its civil society, by combating poverty and exclusion, and by liberating its women."
"Europe has not been naive enough to believe that it can bring democracy with tanks and bombs, even if certain Member States may have laboured under this misapprehension."
"Europe must therefore assume its role as a soft power."
"This is a thankless, difficult role."
"It has equipped itself with a European instrument for democracy and human rights, which today resembles a newborn child."
"It is fragile but promising, if taken great care of."
"The NGOs can submit projects to it without the support of their government, and that is important."
"However, it is also out of the very limited budget for this instrument that the election observation missions are financed."
"These are crucial missions which, in the space of around 10 years, have succeeded in proving their worth, but for which Parliament has already requested more resources and certainly more follow-up action - thank you, Mrs Malmström - but also more political consistency in terms of the way in which we monitor their legitimacy, and here I fully support what Mrs Joly said regarding some of our missions."
"It is not normal for a country that embarks on the democratic electoral process not to be supported in its consolidation."
"Those who take a short-term view no doubt think that democracy is costly."
"It is less costly than war, that is for sure, and this is data that the External Action Service will most certainly take into account in its operations."
"Mr President, can there be democracy without freedom?"
"No."
"Can there be freedom without rights?"
"Of course not."
"This brings us back to the notion of human rights in this debate."
"Joseph Ki-Zerbo, a great Burkinabe scholar, gave the following answer to that question: 'He who lives in absolute poverty has no freedom because he cannot choose between several options.'"
"Poverty is therefore synonymous with a lack of freedom."
"There is therefore a close relationship between freedom, democracy and human rights."
"It is no surprise, then, to see many references to this in the basic texts that govern relations between the European Union and third countries, starting with the Cotonou Agreement, which includes, in particular, a clause on human rights and democracy in the context of the political dialogue with the ACP countries."
"Promoting democracy therefore raises fundamental issues linked to the intelligent stipulation of conditions."
"On the basis of these few observations, we come to the conclusion that democracy is not at the origin of development, but is very often the result of it."
"The partnerships between the European Union and third countries cannot ignore this fact."
"We will not make progress without determination, but we will not make progress without patience, either."
"Today there are a significant number of countries that are embarking on the democratic process."
"Europe can be credited with having supported these processes thanks to a strategy that incorporates the imperatives of the fight against poverty, the codification of human rights, and the promotion of democratic principles and the rule of law."
"In spite of all the criticisms that have just been directed at the policy and which I share, I nevertheless remain convinced that what has been proven to work in the past should also guide us in our future action."
"Mr President, democratisation assists the peaceful pursuit of politics, political change and the management of power in society, as well as respect for human rights."
"Supporting democracy underpins our foreign policy goals of preventing conflict and reducing poverty."
"That is why I was pleased to put the parliamentary amendment calling for European consensus on democratisation, and I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for its initiative in this respect."
"I strongly believe that democratisation should inform all of the European Union's policies vis-à-vis third countries."
"I have to say that I condemn the European Conservative and Reform Group when they oppose paragraph 10 in our text and seem to suggest that Europe can say one thing about democracy and do another about undemocratic countries when it suits us."
"No."
"Finally, as Mrs Malmström has said, democracy building is much more than about elections: it is about building pluralist civil society."
"That is why Europe should fund NGOs that increase citizen participation, support the inclusion of marginalised groups, provide training for legal professionals, promote freedom of expression and of association, and strengthen political parties in parliament."
"It means supporting a civilian surge."
"Mr President, I would like to address the issue of democracy building with regard to our eastern neighbours."
"In recent years there has been a stagnation and, in some cases, a backsliding in terms of democratic standards in these countries."
"Developments in Georgia and Moldova raise most concerns."
"The backbone of any democratic polity: a well-functioning - and I stress well-functioning - civil society is essentially absent in all of our eastern neighbours."
"I would like to congratulate Sweden, the current presiding country, for being one of the initiators of the Eastern Partnership policy."
"This policy has the potential to draw our eastern neighbours closer to the EU."
"However, in many respects, the Eastern Partnership stops short of providing really significant incentives for these countries to embark on painful and lengthy reforms."
"My additional question is: what is the position of the Council in this regard?"
"In other words, what is in the pipeline?"
"Do we intend to act more robustly in order to ensure that democracy in this and many other troubled and fragile areas will be strengthened?"
"(FI) Mr President, I would finally like to say to Minister Malmström that, in my opinion, we as a Union have two weaknesses when it comes to attempts to promote democracy and human rights throughout the world."
"Member States often have very conflicting and differing aspirations."
"The ban on the export of weapons to Uzbekistan would appear to be just such a case: not all Member States are of the same view."
"How can we pursue a common policy like this?"
"Secondly, I want to say that Uzbekistan is also a good example of a country that says to us that the European Union has nothing to teach them about democracy and human rights because the Union has its own defects and problems."
"How can we rid ourselves of these double standards?"
"We are in the habit of lecturing to others, but we do not necessarily practise what we preach."
"I also think that the idea you mentioned of an account of an organisation's democracy focused attention on these double standards."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the Members for being committed to this issue."
"We are entirely in agreement on the need to strengthen democracy in the EU's foreign policy."
"Today, during a period of economic crisis, it is particularly important that this dimension is not overlooked."
"We know that many developing countries are being hit very hard by the crisis."
"Recession results in dissatisfaction and social unrest."
"If there are not well functioning democratic institutions in such a situation, things can go seriously wrong."
"That is why it is important that there are secure democratic institutions and a strong civil society capable of dealing with such crises."
"The eastern partnership is a very important instrument, not least for strengthening democracy."
"We are working intensively on this. We will have a meeting of foreign ministers in December and we hope to be able to launch a great many specific measures at the start of 2010."
"The eastern partnership is an important instrument for strengthening democracy among our immediate neighbours."
"Mrs Hautala brought up the issue of Uzbekistan."
"This is, of course, a very serious matter."
"The human rights situation there is far from satisfactory."
"As Mrs Hautala is aware, extending sanctions requires unanimity in the Council."
"At present, the Council is not unanimous."
"We agree on the objective, however, which is to strengthen democracy and human rights in Uzbekistan."
"We hope that the means of achieving this is through stronger commitment."
"We hope to be able to find alternative ways of strengthening democracy by continually assessing the human rights situation and considering what sort of relations we should have with Uzbekistan."
"There are other ways of having an influence which may be more effective than an arms embargo."
"Very few countries trade in arms with Uzbekistan, so an arms embargo might be more of a symbolic gesture than anything else."
"Perhaps we can find other ways."
"As I mentioned, however, we first require unanimity in the Council and we do not have that at present."
"If the EU is to be credible in its relations with the outside world in the area of human rights and democracy, we must also be strong within the EU."
"Shortcomings exist."
"Perhaps they are not comparable with the terrible injustices committed in other countries, but there are shortcomings internally within the EU."
"We must be vigilant of this at all times if we are to be credible in our dealings with the outside world."
"Finally, I would like to thank you for this debate and also for the excellent resolution that I have seen that has been tabled by Parliament."
"I have not yet managed to look at all the amendments, but I think the resolution tabled is very good."
"It accords entirely with the ambitions of the Swedish Presidency."
"As mentioned, we hope to be able to adopt the Council's conclusions at the meeting with the General Affairs and External Relations Council in November."
"We then look forward to continued discussions with Parliament on this issue."
"in writing. - I fully support this call for a more coherent and effective framework for EU support for democracy-building, the promotion of democratic values and respect for human rights in the world."
"The European Union itself is founded on the very values of democracy and human rights."
"Indeed, the Copenhagen Criteria governing conditions of EU accession demand of candidate members ""stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities""."
"Moreover, the Lisbon Treaty enhances Union's commitment to continue its external action according to its founding principles."
"Indeed, a key objective of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is to consolidate democracy, rule of law, and, respect for human rights."
"I urge that the European External Action Service (EEAS) be established speedily not only an aid to democracy building but also be established as a democratically accountable service to European Parliament."
"Democracy is a universal value."
"Democratisation and good governance are not only ends in themselves but are vital for poverty reduction, sustainable development, peace and stability."
"Indeed, democracy, development and respect for human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, are interdependent and mutually reinforcing."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0212/2009)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Women's participation in positions of responsibility in the job market"
"Recent data have recorded the continuing under-representation of women in positions of responsibility in the European job market: in the larger European enterprises, there is, on average, only one woman in every 10 board members."
"What is the Commission's opinion of the Member States' initiatives to promote more women to positions of economic responsibility?"
"What good practices have been identified, particularly through the work of the European Network of Women in Decision Making in Politics and the Economy?"
"Is the Commission in favour of the proposals on quotas for women on the boards of major enterprises?"
"What proposals and initiatives does it intend to put forward with a view to the final evaluation of the Roadmap for equality between women and men and the revision of the Lisbon Strategy guidelines in 2010?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the number of women taking part in decision making may have been rising over recent years but power in the political and economic areas still lies firmly in male hands."
"Stereotypical preconceptions about the role of women and men and the difficulties of establishing a work-life balance, along with other forms of overt or hidden discrimination, constitute obstacles that prevent women from gaining access to responsible, leading positions."
"Over recent decades, women have become more involved in political decision making in most EU countries."
"The speed of these changes is slow and, unfortunately, the overall proportion of women in powerful positions remains low."
"In the economic sphere, the proportion of women with decision-making powers is very unsatisfactory."
"In the private sector, men account for nine out of ten directors of top European companies."
"Only 3% of these companies have boards headed by a woman."
"The Commission cares very much about supporting the better representation of women in senior roles and it backs the activities of Member States in this regard by collecting, analysing and disseminating comparable data for this area, supporting networks of interested parties and encouraging the sharing of experience and proven approaches at a European level."
"The European network for supporting women in managerial positions, which the Commission set up in June 2008, has stressed the importance of measures aimed at supporting mentoring, developing networks for supporting women, raising the profile of women who take on important roles and encouraging women to apply for senior positions."
"During 2010 the Commission will arrange information activities and the sharing of proven approaches."
"The Commission reports with satisfaction that many Member States have launched initiatives to support the access of women to leading roles, particularly through cultural events in the private sector, educational programmes for women who are interested in careers at the most senior levels, the development of a charter or mark for companies that support gender equality, the introduction of codes of good practice in companies and events in support of the work-life balance and the fight against gender-based prejudice."
"The question of quotas for women on the boards of large companies is under discussion."
"In my opinion, there is a need in this context to study the experience of Scandinavia, where this radical approach has been adopted."
"It is, however, entirely up to the Member States which strategy to choose, based on their specific circumstances."
"I would like to point out that Article 141 Paragraph 4 of the Treaty allows Member States to adopt 'positive action measures'."
"The European Court of Justice, however, has interpreted this option narrowly and has prohibited the automatic adoption of such measures, requiring that each case be examined individually according to objective criteria."
"The Commission intends to submit a new strategic framework for gender equality in mid-2010 which will be accompanied by a detailed impact analysis and will take account of the results of implementing the existing plan for the period 2006-2010."
"It should be a Commission priority to support the greater participation of women in senior roles."
"Last but not least, the Commission will submit a proposal at the beginning of next year for a new post-2010 growth and employment strategy."
"The issue of gender equality should be a central element in the new strategy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that the equal representation of women and men is an issue not only of political principle, democracy and ethics, but is, in essence, a fundamental economic issue, since there can be no hope for future development unless our society makes use of all of its talents in the best possible way."
"I must therefore state clearly that gender equality and an appropriate representation of women in leading roles in itself constitutes an active component of European competitiveness."
"(EL) Commissioner, thank you once again for your commitment to the promotion of women to positions of responsibility."
"May I say that my question was more specific."
"In light of the review of the Lisbon objectives and the evaluation of the roadmap, will the European Commission propose specific measures to combat the lack of women in positions of responsibility in the labour market."
"Will the models, the Norwegian model to which you referred, be an inspiration in terms of a guideline?"
"How does the case law of the European Court of Justice, to which you referred, link in with this?"
"Is it encouraging or discouraging you, as the European Commission, to take a position in favour of one direction?"
"Thank you for the supplementary question."
"In my opinion, I expressed myself clearly on this matter, but nonetheless I think there is a need to be clearer still."
"The Commission generally considers equal opportunities to be a major component of European competitiveness, regardless of the moral obligations that are associated with it."
"This form of equality will therefore be a very high priority component of future strategies and we are proposing appropriate measures that may advance this issue in all of the relevant documents."
"I would like to state that we must always remain within the framework of the Treaty, of course, but we are prepared to use this framework to the full."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, what you have just had to say did sound very good, but politicians must always have an eye on whether their actions live up to their words."
"I have a question for you, namely how can it be that, over the last five years, it has only been male high-ranking members of the Commission that I have had the opportunity of working with?"
"How can it be that the Commission does not have gender parity in its composition?"
"It also appears that it will not be possible for the Commission to have a balanced gender make-up in future, either."
"Would it not be a good thing to set an example for once, in order to be much more credible when taking further steps?"
"I think it would be appropriate to emphasise that the Commission currently has a greater representation of women than ever before."
"It would also be appropriate to point out that my female colleagues have held, and are holding, the most important portfolios."
"There is no doubt at all about this."
"I could mention Neelie Kroes, Dalia Grybauskaite and so on, as simply all of my female colleagues hold very significant portfolios."
"The Commission is therefore setting an example from this perspective, but it is clear that the appointment of commissioners is in the hands of Member States and if the Member States do not put forward female candidates, then that will naturally be reflected in the make-up of the Commission."
"As far as the structure of the European administration is concerned, you are well aware that the Commission has plans to improve the situation and to carry on improving it, as we are still far from having an appropriate representation of men and women and I am delighted to say that, thanks to the efforts of my colleague Siim Kallas, we have made some very clear progress if you compare the numbers at the outset with the situation today."
"However, you are right to say that the situation is still far from satisfactory."
"Mr President, we have this conversation every year, and it strikes me that the politics needs to change if we want to have more people - and specifically more women - involved in the Commission, Council and Parliament, which does not seem to want that."
"The way we function as a parliament does not suit parents with children - be they men or women - and one has to make a choice."
"I chose this career but I have somebody who has chosen to be at home."
"I think we need to be realistic in our discussions about what is practical."
"I pointed out in my introduction that there were many situations that were either negative or positive."
"It is obvious that we all take our own fundamental decisions in the end, although some institutions, some policies and some arrangements clearly give people much more freedom of choice than others."
"I am therefore quite clear in my mind that, apart from anything else, we need to take a constitutional approach to equal opportunity and to the elimination of all types of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, because at the moment, it is not true that men and women are afforded the same choices."
"Women are still in a disadvantaged position unfortunately which, apart from anything else, manifests itself overtly in their lack of access to roles in which political or economic decisions are taken."
"As the questioners are not present, Questions 22 and 23 lapse."
"Part two"
"Subject: Language learning in border regions"
"Does the Commission consider that enough is being done in the Member States and at EU level to ensure that young people living in the border regions between Member States learn the language of the neighbouring country?"
"Can national minorities and cross-border Euroregions make a specific and positive contribution to this?"
"In accordance with Article 149 of the EC Treaty, educational content and the organisation of education systems are the sole responsibility of Member States."
"As is mentioned in the relevant article, the EU will contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting their actions."
"On the other hand, the Commission believes that the selection of languages taught in Member State schools must take into account geographical location and the presence of national minorities."
"This point was emphasised in the September 2008 Communication entitled 'Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment', where it is stated that efforts are still required to increase the number of languages being taught, particularly with regard to choosing the second foreign language, while taking account of local conditions."
"As part of the procedures for extending the options in terms of the languages taught, the European Commission suggests that dialogue is established between the education bodies and education providers, supported, for instance, through the Comenius Regio programme, partnerships with the interested local parties, and through twinning with institutions in other countries."
"The EU's programmes for education, training and young people support the learning of all the languages spoken in the European Union, including those spoken by minorities, by also supporting young people travelling abroad in order to learn these languages."
"The programmes promoting European cross-border territorial cooperation can also support actions relating to training and social inclusion, including the study of languages."
"For example, the project Avenir éducatif commun, supported by the France-UK cross-border programme for the 2007-2013 period, is intended to set up a cross-border network of schools, especially for the study of languages and getting started in business."
"The total cost is EUR 2.2 million, with partners involved on both sides of the Channel."
"Another example from another part of Europe is highlighted by a project being run as three cross-border programmes involving Vienna: Austria-Czech Republic, Austria-Slovakia and Austria-Hungary."
"The project entails preparing young people for life in the cross-border region within Central Europe, particularly through offering an education aimed at acquiring a range of skills: linguistic, intercultural, communication and knowledge."
"The total cost of this project is EUR 791 000."
"I would like to ask Mr Posselt whether he has an additional question."
"(DE) Mr President, you are an impressive example of multilingualism."
"First of all, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether a similar project to the one he mentioned, namely between Austria and Hungary and between Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, could not be put in place between Hungary and Slovakia?"
"That would certainly be very beneficial and useful from a political point of view."
"My second point is that I believe that there should be more real-life learning of the languages of the neighbouring countries in border regions, such as Czech in eastern Bavaria, but that this should not be restricted to schools."
"In Schirnding, for example, we have a German-Czech nursery school."
"Could you also support nurseries?"
"I am also interested in adult learning - lifelong learning - whereby older generations in border regions, too, have an opportunity to learn the neighbouring language."
"Thank you for the additional questions."
"As regards the first issue concerning a possible project between Hungary and Slovakia, if such a project is submitted to the European Commission, we will certainly give it our utmost attention."
"We want to contribute in this way to finding solutions of mutual interest to both countries."
"As regards the second issue, I would first of all like to emphasise that in September, we launched an initiative linked to the early learning of foreign languages."
"This initiative will last a number of years and is already enjoying a particular degree of success."
"There is also a campaign in Member States as part of this initiative to encourage the parents of children aged between 2 and 6 to motivate their children to learn foreign languages."
"With regard to the second part of the question about lifelong learning, this is the main objective of the policy we are promoting."
"We have a large number of projects aimed at learning foreign languages and also acquiring intercultural skills for people who are outside the education system, including for those attending vocational colleges, those who have, so to speak, fewer opportunities, as well as for retired people and the unemployed."
"This situation is not only reflected in the way in which we finance different projects, but it is also very clearly highlighted in the strategy the European Commission adopted in 2008."
"We want all of the European Union's citizens, not only young people, to be able to have the means and opportunity to learn at least two foreign languages."
"(PL) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for that interesting information, but in your answer, you concentrated on schools, whereas attempts have also been made in several border cities to set up universities."
"This type of university has been established, for example, on the border of Poland and Germany in Frankfurt - European University Viadrina."
"I would like to ask this: within the framework of the various schools which you spoke about, is support also being considered for this type of institution of higher education, namely universities which have come into being in various cities situated on national borders inside the European Union?"
"If universities are able to submit projects to meet the requirements of the lifelong learning programme during the 2007-2013 period, the European Commission is prepared to finance these projects as well."
"In fact, I want to mention to you that a whole series of projects already being financed by the European Commission also include a large number of universities as partners throughout the whole European Union."
"Therefore, my answer is a definite 'yes'."
"What matters is the quality of the project submitted by the various representatives."
"(DE) Mr President, we have numerous Erasmus programmes for students, young entrepreneurs and now for journalists."
"Do you think that it would also be possible to use Erasmus programmes in order to improve communication in border regions, and where would you put the emphasis in that regard?"
"My answer to this question is a definite 'yes'."
"On the subject of the Erasmus Programme, what started around 20 years ago as a programme that was not viewed in a very positive light by various agencies in the EU is currently one of the most successful programmes in the European Union."
"During the frequent visits that I have made, not only to the capitals of Member States but also to very many regions in the European Union, I have been able to witness the extremely positive impact of this programme."
"The subject of universities in Poland and Germany has already been mentioned earlier."
"I remember with pleasure that when I visited the University of Warsaw, I had the opportunity to see a large number of German students in Poland who had the chance, through the Erasmus Programme, to acquire some knowledge of Polish and of Polish culture as well, in other words, what we would term as intercultural knowledge."
"They demonstrate very clearly how efficient and effective this knowledge is."
"In conclusion to my response, I wish to remind you that the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, mentioned his intention to promote during his future mandate in the period ahead those initiatives which relate to strengthening and accelerating the movement of young people, precisely so that they can acquire these skills which are increasingly necessary."
"Subject: Commission negligence in investigation of Siemens scandal"
"The biggest case of corruption to hit the European Union in the last five years is the Siemens scandal."
"It emerges from the judicial investigation, court judgments, the confessions of those involved and public statements by the company itself that political parties and individuals in positions of responsibility in various countries, including Greece, were bribed so that the company would gain an advantage in obtaining contracts for projects and procurement on behalf of government and public enterprises, many of which were co-financed from Community funds."
"Since the Siemens scandal came to light, the Commissioner responsible for combating fraud, Mr Siim Kallas, has stated, in response to parliamentary scrutiny of the case, that the investigation is not within the competence of the European Union and that the Member States have not requested the assistance of the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"In the light of that statement, will the Commission say in what way the Commission and OLAF, which is competent to investigate cases of fraud against the Community budget, have protected European citizens' money?"
"In what way have the Commission and OLAF intervened in this important case to demand transparency?"
"What are the Commission's and OLAF's conclusions in relation to this case?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission pays great attention to all corruption cases all over Europe, but I must say that the number of current matters directly and indirectly involving Siemens in which EU funds are involved is quite limited."
"The following is an overview of four of the matters concerned."
"A case currently investigated by OLAF and closed in the last quarter of 2003, involving external aid, is in judicial follow-up in Germany."
"OLAF is following closely the judicial proceedings in that country."
"A second OLAF case relating to projects funded by the EIB is currently being investigated."
"It involves public procurement procedures."
"Thirdly, another matter relating to projects funded by the European Investment Bank and involving public procurement procedures is currently being evaluated by OLAF in order to determine whether there are sufficiently serious suspicions of fraud or irregularity detrimental to the financial interests of the EU."
"Based on the outcome of this evaluation, OLAF will decide if a case needs to be opened in this matter."
"Finally, fourthly, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a ruling on 4 November 2008 in a case involving Structural Funds and in which Siemens was originally implicated."
"It was investigated by the national authorities in the mid-1990s, and the resulting judicial proceedings have been closely followed by UCLAF and subsequently OLAF."
"This ruling, inter alia, sentenced several persons to terms of imprisonment, and imposed fines for forgery."
"However, it should also be noted that in this instance, Siemens was acquitted in the case in the first ruling of the Criminal Court of Madrid issued on 22 June 2006."
"As with all these kinds of cases, the general point is that OLAF is not a law enforcement agency."
"OLAF cooperates closely with Member States; the latter have an obligation to inform OLAF, and OLAF naturally follows up and gives serious attention to all the cases where EU funds are somehow involved or have been under investigation."
"This is the general picture."
"OLAF also participates closely in international cooperation with all other international institutions in combating misuse of money made available for humanitarian aid and other projects."
"In relation to possible specific case elements, if the honourable Member is in possession of material which could be relevant to such matters, the Commission would encourage him to transmit it to OLAF, which will assess it and take appropriate decisions on it in accordance with its mandate."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the feeling in Greece about the Siemens scandal is basically as reported in the press."
"In other words, the feeling is that the scandal - the biggest in post-war Greece - is heading definitively towards limitation following the second ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court in Germany, which states that Mr Christoforakos, the former CEO of Siemens Hellas and high priest of the corruption, cannot be extradited from Germany to Greece."
"That is the feeling."
"This is how the scandal is developing in Greece, the scandal in which, further to confessions and convictions by German courts, state officials have been involved and included, officials who, for years, were bribed with its dirty money to award an unknown number of procurement and works contracts to Siemens."
"I ask again, Commissioner; while everyone knows that most of these procurements were cofinanced works, only your services - and unfortunately your reply confirms as much - pretend that they do not know this, taking refuge in my view in arbitrary terms of Community provisions."
"Questions are being asked and the answers are: give us information, we are investigating the matter, we are monitoring it."
"I want a specific answer."
"Commissioner, you have an obligation to save European taxpayers' money."
"What will the Commission do in order to bring persons who it has been confirmed are infringing Community procurement legislation to justice?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - In my area of responsibility for budget discharge, I will soon appear before Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control to explain what should be done to protect and to ensure the proper use of European money; these are very large topics."
"Again, if you have any information concerning the misuse of money in cofinanced projects, we would be very happy - as would DG REGIO and other departments - to receive such information."
"I can assure you that this information will be handled very seriously."
"However, as regards the extradition of an individual from one Member State to another, this is purely a matter in the hands of Member States, and none of the directorates-general in my area of responsibility can do anything to facilitate the extradition of a person for whom this is requested."
"Subject: Cigarette smuggling and revenue"
"A European Anti-Fraud Office press release in August told of the conviction of a major cigarette smuggler in the US."
"While this is to be welcomed, the fact remains that the illicit cigarette trade costs the EU as much as €9.5 billion in lost revenue each year and that this money goes to criminals and has been used to fund terrorist organisations such as the Real IRA."
"What is the Commission's strategy to deal with the fact that 97% of illegal cigarettes are evading the legitimate tax net at the European taxpayer's expense and, subsequently, to the detriment of European security?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I should like to thank the honourable Member for this question, which allows me once again to pay attention to this huge issue which is damaging to the budgets of the Member States."
"This is again a matter where Member States act, but where cooperation between Member States is vital and also where our service, OLAF, is very active and plays an important role in fighting international cigarette smuggling."
"OLAF has a clear strategy."
"Firstly, OLAF assists and supports law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union with their cases, and organises and coordinates Europe-wide operations: Operation Diabolo in 2007 aimed at counterfeit from China which is smuggled in shipping containers to the EU;"
"OLAF provides intelligence to its partners about the emerging threats and cooperates with Member States, so this is really an area of international cooperation."
"OLAF's work demonstrates that this cooperation should be enforced, but I must also say that there have been two very important events during the five-year tenure of this Commission in which OLAF has been extremely instrumental."
"These are the Philip Morris agreement, and subsequently the Japan Tobacco agreement in December 2007, where the biggest tobacco corporations admitted that they had some shortcomings in dealing with fair trade in cigarettes, and paid substantial amounts of money to the EU budget; they are also cooperating very closely to fight cigarette smuggling, which is not in their interests either."
"These were very important achievements, and all Member States are signatories to the latest Japan Tobacco agreement."
"We continue to cooperate in this difficult field, but I think that with these two big agreements, the landscape has changed a little and we notice modest progress."
"The case referred to by the honourable Member, of the prosecution and jailing of a third country national, is a very important case, and this is one of the many international investigations coordinated by the Office on the basis of such an agreement."
"There have been many prosecutions in the EU based on OLAF's work."
"This is the first prosecution in a third country of a non-EU national directly related to the smuggling of cigarettes into the EU, so it also shows worldwide cooperation."
"I can produce several other details from liaison officers in China and other places."
"We all have an interest in enhancing this cooperation and combating cigarette smuggling."
"Leaving aside the jobs which have been undermined in registered businesses, the health implications of this are extraordinary."
"Half of all the patients admitted to the largest hospital in Ireland, St James's Hospital, are admitted with smoke-related illnesses."
"If you care to check in all the other Member States, you will find a similar situation."
"These cigarettes are contributing to that problem but not making any contribution to the cost of treating it."
"I understand that the figure that has been put on the amount of illicit trade coming into the European Union by way of cigarettes is EUR 9.5 billion, and 97% of it goes undetected."
"Is it not time for a comprehensive approach by the Commission, including, for example, looking at the possibility of a coastguard to deal with this problem?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I recently visited a country outside the European Union where smoking is not prohibited, and I really noticed how big a difference there is in the European Union where you cannot smell the odour of cigarettes in public places at least."
"I suppose that this is the most important step to take in order to avoid all health risks."
"As regards the fight against cigarette smuggling, we must use all our law enforcement agencies."
"This is clearly the most important priority, but it is again the duty of border guards in the Member States to seize illegal cigarettes."
"I myself have visited a port which has very sophisticated equipment for discovering shipments of illegal cigarettes, but this is the province of each individual Member State."
"We can only facilitate, we can only provide intelligence, and do everything we can to help the Member States."
"It is up to their border services to seize such shipments and stop them at the border."
"(DE) Commissioner, cigarette smuggling can be divided into three streams: the funds, the goods and, finally, the accompanying documentation."
"Can you envisage the introduction of dedicated taxation or duties for the funding streams which, after all, are known and do flow here?"
"We are, of course, already familiar with this kind of financial transactions tax, where it is not the product, not the paperwork, but the financial transactions that are heavily taxed."
"It is an attractive challenge to consider this with countries such as Switzerland."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I agree that this is a very important issue for the tax authorities."
"We in Europe have quite a substantial excise tax on tobacco products, but as I know from the experience of dealing with the Philip Morris agreement and the Japan Tobacco agreement, this involves largely the same corporations, which are our main producers of tobacco."
"This is also the outcome: that they are cooperating."
"I do not know about Switzerland; we do not have any indications that Switzerland is behaving problematically in this field in Europe in general."
"All states recognise the threats from the illegal cigarette trade, so if we have some indications, we will definitely be in contact with the Swiss authorities."
"As the questioner is not present, Question No 27 lapses."
"Subject: Education under the new European political strategy"
"In the current context of economic recession, there have been many calls for a new European strategy for employment and sustainable and intelligent growth."
"In this regard, a number of recommendations have been made in a wide variety of fields but no indication has been given as to what should be done for education, nor have any actual initiatives been taken by either the Commission or the Member States."
"In view of the need to complete the implementation of the Bologna Process, itself fraught with difficulties, to modernise universities and other higher education institutions, to foster the education/innovation/research triangle and to encourage the accreditation of professional training across Europe, does the Commission intend to take measures or initiatives in this field under the new European strategy to create a fully integrated, globally competitive, socially inclusive, high-quality European Higher Education Area by 2010?"
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you for that question because it is very relevant these days."
"I would like to highlight that, under the umbrella of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, the Commission has, for several years, been pursuing its modernisation agenda for European higher education."
"This agenda is particularly focused on the three specific areas of curricula, governance and funding."
"Reforms in the area of curricula are largely pursued within the framework of the Bologna Process, which seeks to create a European higher education area by 2010."
"As you know, the Bologna Process is not a Commission initiative, but an intergovernmental process of 46 European countries."
"The Commission, however, recognises its utmost importance and has joined the process, and is fully supporting it because of its relevance to its own modernisation agenda for higher education."
"Just to highlight some of the related initiatives over the past year, I would mention the fostering of the knowledge triangle by creating the European Institute for Innovation and Technology, encouragement for recognition of education and training across Europe, the introduction of the European qualification framework for lifelong learning, the European credit transfer and accumulation system, diploma supplements and European credits for vocational education and training."
"One of the goals is also to make European higher education more transparent and comparable, and therefore the projects for classification and ranking of higher education institutions are under way."
"The Commission also recognises the high importance of today's and tomorrow's labour markets and the challenges which this brings, especially for the young generation, and we have therefore come up with the 'new skills for new jobs' initiative, and the establishment of a university business forum where very important exchanges of views, opinions and experience are taking place both in academia and businesses."
"Regarding the European higher education area, there is consensus among the participating countries that, although a lot has been achieved up to now and since 1999, the project will not come to an end in 2010 but will continue at least until 2020."
"From the Commission perspective, the Bologna Process should, in the coming years, focus on how to further promote mobility in higher education, strengthen the social dimension through equitable access to higher education, and develop the global dimension of the process, meaning cooperation between European higher education institutions and their partners worldwide."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, for the second time today, I have the pleasure of putting questions to you and hearing your answers."
"Thank you for your words."
"Obviously we agree on the assessment of everything that is happening in the Bologna Process."
"My question was more in relation to the immediate future and the not so immediate future, because the economic crisis that we are suffering means that there is an entire series of sectors, some mature sectors, that are not going to generate new jobs."
"And we are talking about new jobs in a new economy that we are calling 'green', among many other things."
"Therefore my question is: how does this new situation, this new economy that we are trying to start up, translate into the plans and studies, both in universities and in professional training, particularly now that, as you are perfectly aware, we have already begun to implement the Copenhagen Process on professional training?"
"I would like to hear more about your views on this."
"Member of the Commission. - I think that again you have pointed to a very important problem."
"We already discussed this morning that we now have 78 million people in the European Union with basic or lower skills, and it is very clear that, by the deadline which we have set for ourselves of 2020, we will definitely not have the same number of jobs for those people with basic or lower skills."
"Therefore, it is absolutely imperative to prepare for that time: we have to upgrade and modernise our educational system, and we have to progress with analysing and searching to ascertain what these new skills and jobs might be."
"We have to prepare the younger generation, in particular, but also the middle generation, for this."
"Therefore we would like to continue with the ongoing research under the strategic framework 'Education and Training 2020' for policy cooperation and mutual learning."
"This is just one of the frameworks in which we would like to continue and to cooperate with educational institutions and with businesses on future requirements for the most wide-ranging and most relevant mix of skills that our citizens will need by 2020."
"Clearly, education is largely a matter for Member State governments, but one issue that the Commissioner could help to coordinate is putting an end to what I would call apartheid in the educational system."
"In whole sections of our community, people just do not have access to third-level education."
"If you take Dublin, for example, I could identify five areas which make up 75% of the prisoner population at Mountjoy Jail, which is our biggest prison."
"Needless to say, access to third-level education in those same communities in the 21st century is still at an all-time low."
"I presume that is the case right across Europe."
"Could you not promote standards to end apartheid and open up third-level education to everybody?"
"Member of the Commission. - You started your question with a very clear analysis that there is a division of labour and division of competences, but it is very clear that the Commission is strongly behind all efforts to increase the proportion of the population with the highest possible level of education."
"It is very clear that only by improving the level of education, by enlarging access to high-quality tertiary education, as you mentioned, that we can preserve the cutting edge of the European economy and preserve the prosperity and high living standards we enjoy in Europe."
"I think therefore that the Commission and the Member States have to work very closely in this respect to create the conditions whereby students or pupils from difficult socio-economic backgrounds can also get a fair chance and fair access to higher and university education."
"Nowadays, 19% of young people in Europe drop out of school."
"The European Union cannot achieve sustainable economic development if it is going to fail to invest in education and research."
"So far, only five Member States have invested more than 2% of GDP in research and innovation."
"Both Member States' GDP and the Community budget are decreasing due to the economic crisis."
"There is therefore a risk that the budgets assigned to education and research will be reduced in the coming years."
"However, we need to invest in education and innovation so that the European Union can maintain its economic competitiveness and create new jobs."
"What measures can the Commission, along with Member States, adopt to ensure that a minimum level of investment in research and education will be guaranteed in the coming years?"
"Member of the Commission. - You are absolutely right that the percentage of early school leavers in Europe is very high."
"We set ourselves the level of 10%, to be achieved by 2010."
"It is quite obvious that this benchmark will not be reached because currently, there are around 15% of early school leavers, and you are absolutely right that this does not reflect well on the need for quality in our educational systems around Europe."
"You are also right that, under current circumstances - where national governments are under different constraints regarding public finances and the financing of stimulus packages, and are very often implementing exit strategies aimed at restoring public finances to a sound footing in the coming years - there is much debate over the budget."
"What should be the priorities?"
"Where should we place our emphasis?"
"I think you have already noticed that there is always a strong voice from the Commission side highlighting the need to keep an adequate level of financing for research and innovation in the educational sectors, because we believe this is how we will preserve and improve our competitive edge and prepare our future researchers, our future workers in highly competitive areas for better performance in the future."
"You will certainly hear voices from the Commission appealing clearly to keep financing for education-related activities and for research and innovatory aid at the highest possible level, even under these very difficult economic constraints."
"Subject: Measures to guarantee young people access to quality education, to encourage and assist them to continue their studies and to ease their entry onto the job market"
"There are 96 million young people between the ages of 15 and 29 in the EU, which represents around 20% of the total population."
"20% of young people under the age of 25 are exposed to the risk of poverty, according to Eurostat statistics for 2007, while stable jobs are increasingly hard to find owing to the economic and financial crisis."
"Approximately 15% of young Europeans abandon their schooling."
"In February 2009, some 17.5% of Europeans under the age of 25 did not have a job, with this being more than twice the overall unemployment rate for the EU, which stood at 7.9% for the same period."
"Similarly, many young Europeans are being forced to accept temporary jobs because they cannot find permanent ones."
"Since the future of Europe depends on the younger generation, could the Commission state what measures it is contemplating to guarantee young people access to quality education, to encourage and assist them to continue their studies and to ease their entry onto the job market, thereby ensuring their fuller integration into society?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I already used some of the arguments in my previous answer, but it is clear that this is a very important area and I will try to highlight some other additional information in responding to this question."
"As you know, in accordance with Articles 149 and 150 of the EC Treaty, responsibility for the content and organisation of education and training systems rests with the Member States."
"It is really up to them to decide the content of their educational programmes for all levels of education and training."
"The Commission recognises, however, the importance of the issue raised by the honourable Member and supports Member States in implementing their reforms through the open method of coordination."
"The 2006 recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning defines the key competences young people should develop during their initial education and training to a level that equips them for adult life and which would allow them to develop very good job skills for the future."
"We should also look at the aforementioned strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training ('ET 2020') from this perspective."
"I would underline that among the priority areas for the first cycle of this programme, the Commission aims to develop cooperation among Member States on improving basic skills in reading, mathematics and science, and to intensify work on reducing the number of early leavers from education and training."
"Through the Copenhagen Process, European Union Member States are increasingly cooperating to share experience and improve links between vocational education and training and the labour market to help youngsters access the labour market on better terms."
"Boosting the attractiveness and quality of vocational educational training is a main priority, as is fostering the notion of lifelong learning and related policies so that the European workforce is flexible and able to adapt to changes in labour market conditions."
"Just to highlight some other programmes, the Leonardo da Vinci programme's mobility action is also a highly effective tool to help youngsters access the labour market."
"This mostly concerns apprentices and other youngsters on the job market."
"Thanks to this programme, they can undertake part of their training in another country."
"So far, the results have been very positive because these placements abroad have improved skills that are useful for employers."
"They have improved their language abilities and intercultural skills."
"I should also mention the Erasmus Programme, but in a slightly different light because, up to now, we have been speaking mostly about exchanges for students among universities."
"Since 2007, however, the Erasmus Programme has also been supporting student placements in enterprises."
"This programme has been very successful since the start, as in its first year of operation alone, over 20 000 students carried out a work placement abroad and over 15 000 enterprises have participated in this effort."
"This is one example of how we can enhance the employability of graduates and foster better cooperation between academia and business."
"We have already discussed the positive impact of the Bologna Process on student mobility and on cooperation among universities and higher education institutions, so I will not repeat what I already said a few minutes ago."
"To conclude, I would like to underline that the Commission acknowledges the particular difficulties that young people face when they are entering the labour market."
"In the framework of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and more and better jobs, both the Commission and the European Council have put a particular focus on improving the employment situation of young people."
"Member States have committed themselves through the adoption of the European Youth Pact in 2005 to devote more attention to the integration of young people into education, employment and society overall, but the initial very promising progress has been stalled because of the current economic crisis."
"It is true that young people have been hit particularly hard as they have been the first to lose their jobs under the current circumstances."
"In its Communication 'A shared commitment for employment' of June 2009, the Commission has encouraged Member States and social partners to ensure that young people, despite the difficult economic environment, have access to quality education and training and, in particular, to high-quality apprenticeships and traineeships."
"(RO) There is a risk due to the economic crisis that it will be harder for young people to find a job, that they will have to accept a job that is beneath their level of qualifications or that they will be forced to spend longer periods in unemployment."
"The Commission should ensure that these young people have the opportunity to receive training during this period of unemployment and are not put at a disadvantage by employment terms requiring a minimum period of experience, sometimes of 5-10 years."
"What measures does the Commission envisage adopting with this in mind?"
"Member of the Commission. - You are absolutely right that, under the current circumstances, the Commission and the Member States must be very creative in improving conditions for young people to enable them either to keep their jobs or, if they have lost them, to retrain them and better prepare them for the next opportunity, the next possible employment."
"The Commission is working very closely with the Member States and experts, and in the current situation, they are focusing on three areas: how to use this period to ensure that they achieve the right basic skills and key competences, how to make high-quality education more equitable and how to ensure the quality of teaching and learning in schools."
"I believe that these are basic preconditions for preparing young people to overcome this very difficult period and better prepare them for the next wave of jobs which, hopefully, will be created once the crisis has subsided."
"Subject: Volunteerism in Sport"
"Can the Commission outline the initiatives that it intends to pursue to promote volunteerism in sport in Europe to a greater extent?"
"Member of the Commission. - Volunteering in third sector activities plays an important role in EU policy making, given the benefits for society in terms of cohesion, inclusion, democracy, citizenship and also bringing us very clear, inherent, economic value."
"Volunteering provides many occasions for non-formal education and deserves to be adequately recognised."
"While volunteering takes place in many sectors, there are structural specificities regarding the field of sport."
"Voluntary activity in sport forms the basis for the organisation, administration and implementation of sport activities in new Member States and plays a fundamental role in supporting the entire sport structure."
"This importance of voluntary activity in sport has repeatedly been acknowledged at the EU political level: in its 2007 White Paper on Sport, the Commission explicitly recognises the role of voluntary activity as one of the common elements of the European approach to sport."
"In its 'Pierre de Coubertin' action plan, the White Paper therefore seeks to promote volunteering in sport and non-profit sport organisations through specific actions, including a study on volunteering and exchange of good practices within the informal EU 'non-profit sport organisation' working group."
"In addition, projects relating to volunteering in sport have been financed through the 'Europe for Citizens' and 'Youth in Action' programmes."
"A new study on volunteering was launched in spring 2009 and it described volunteering and it will describe the volunteering in all 27 Member States."
"This will bring deep analyses of the main opportunities and challenges, and it will be followed by the recommendation to the European Union Member States, civil society and sport organisations."
"The study results are expected before the end of 2009, so we will definitely be receiving them in the coming weeks."
"We believe that this study should contribute to an increased understanding of volunteering in sports, in both societal and economic terms, as a basis for responding to the political demand to promote voluntary activities in sport and its underlying structure in an EU context."
"As stipulated in its proposal, which is still subject to the legislative procedure, the Commission also intends to promote voluntary activity in sport under the framework of European Year on Volunteering 2011."
"Provided that the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, the implementation of new provisions on sport, which include the specific reference to the promotion of sports structures based on voluntary activities at EU level, will require due reflection."
"In that event, the Commission will hold consultations with all concerned stakeholders to develop policy and suitable initiatives with a clear EU added value."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner, particularly for his references to the White Paper on Sport, which I welcome."
"I want to refer to obesity, which is one of the most serious public health problems in Europe at the present time."
"It is estimated that there are 22 million overweight children in the European Union, of which 5.1 million are considered obese."
"The increase in child obesity is extremely worrying."
"As childhood obesity is also strongly linked to obesity in adulthood, the best time to address the problem is early in life."
"How does the Commission intend to link volunteerism in sport and the 'sport for all' concept with the battle against rising obesity levels amongst children within the European Union and within Member States?"
"Is there any possibility that an education programme could be run by your department to ensure that message is got across throughout Europe and in each Member State?"
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you for raising this very important topic, which is a little bit related to the subsequent question."
"I agree with you 100% that obesity in children and, later on, among adults, is one of the urgent problems we are facing in the European Union."
"I will speak later about the studies which we have completed and evaluated on this subject, and it is very clear that there are two sides to the coin."
"On the one hand, we have to work very hard on improving sports activities in schools and on encouraging sports activities among adults; on the other hand we have to be very careful about nutritional guidelines."
"As I am sure you are fully aware, the latest studies have clearly established that we probably had a higher intake of calories in the 1950s."
"At that time, we consumed more fat, but we did not have the problem with obesity."
"The answer is very clear that people then moved about much more and had much more physical activity."
"One of the conclusions is therefore that we cannot win the battle against obesity through dietary recommendations alone, but that these must be combined with adequate physical activity."
"In this respect, the European Union is still waiting for real competences in sport."
"We are waiting for the completion of the Lisbon Treaty ratification process, and then the Commission will engage in wide consultations with all stakeholders so that we can prepare very good, widely accepted and positive initiatives."
"This will be one of the topics on which we should concentrate, as one way to positively improve the situation among children is to increase the number of hours in school devoted to physical activity."
"This will not be so difficult to introduce and I am sure it would bring very important and positive results."
"You said in your response to Mr Aylward that volunteering brings clear economic value."
"Indeed it does, and social value as well."
"Given that you also mention 2011 as the European Year on Volunteering in your response, I would like to ask why the Commission has only proposed a budget of EUR 6 million for this year; the year 2010 will have a budget of EUR 18 million."
"Volunteering is free in the sense that it is freely given, but that is not a good reason for the European Commission not to invest in the 100 million volunteers across the EU."
"I would therefore like your views on the amount of funding that has been allocated to this year, because I genuinely believe it is not sufficient."
"Member of the Commission. - I was just consulting my chef de cabinet to give you as precise an answer as possible."
"As far as my information goes, EUR 8 million was allocated for the whole Year of Volunteering."
"I believe that with appropriate planning - which I hope we could start very soon once the decision is taken - and this amount of money, we can really highlight the importance of volunteering, the benefits it brings to social life and the savings it brings to the organisation of societal, cultural and other activities."
"I hope that we can definitely achieve the goals you mentioned in your question with this amount of money."
"Subject: White Paper on sport"
"In accordance with the policy objectives of the EU White Paper on sport, what programmes is the European Commission implementing to highlight the benefits of better dietary practices in Europe?"
"Member of the Commission. - This question is still related to a certain extent to my previous answer as to how we can combine better dietary practices, how we can promote a healthier lifestyle, and how we can bring European value added to the national policies in these areas."
"I should first of all mention that the Commission's White Paper 'A strategy for Europe on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues' highlighted the importance of taking proactive steps to reverse the decline in physical activity, and the actions suggested in the area of physical activity in this White Paper and in the White Paper on Sport mutually reinforce and complement each other."
"The Commission has created a High Level Group on Nutrition and Physical Activity where officials from all Member States can exchange policy ideas and best practices and gain an overview of all government policies in this area."
"As you probably know, this High Level Group meets at least three times a year."
"Through the Public Health Programme, the Commission has been giving support to initiatives, among others, to network local partnerships targeting nutrition and physical activity in young people."
"Coming back to the White Paper on Nutrition, I have to underline that this paper highlights that the private sector and NGOs have very important roles to play in helping us to ensure that there will be an actual decline in obesity levels."
"The work of the European Platform on diet, physical activity and health is ongoing, and Platform members commit themselves to actions in their area to try to reverse the trend."
"In the area of sport, the White Paper remains the single most important reference point."
"It foresees several actions in the area of sport and health, known under the concept of 'Health-Enhancing Physical Activity' (HEPA), which include the support of the HEPA network."
"It also proposed more funding opportunities for projects in this area, namely in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the EU Public Health Programme, the Youth and Citizenship programmes and the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"The EU Physical Activity Guidelines adopted in 2008 can also be regarded as a contribution to informing citizens about the benefits of physical activity and maintaining an appropriate balance between nutrition and physical activity."
"The Commission is currently implementing a preparatory action in the field of sport in order to prepare future EU actions in accordance with the budgetary decisions taken by Parliament, and the 2009 preparatory action has already provided a clear indication about the high interest in the area of HEPA, with 64% of the applications for the action being in this area."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"In fact, it was not related to the previous question; I was taking a different angle."
"The Commissioner touched on two points that I wanted to bring up: first of all, with regard to the Nutrition and Health Group that is meeting with regard to types of food and dietary conditions, but also with regard to false advertising by many people involved in saying that sport is linked to certain types of products and additives, which can be very harmful to health."
"Instead of using natural products to create a better, healthy environment for those people who want to train in sports, they are using supplements such as growth hormones condensed into certain drinks and high-performance drinks, which are sold on the basis that they give you extra pep or extra zip but, in reality, cause huge health problems."
"This is why I wanted to link the very finest of sport and what sportsmen and women do to get to the condition they are in, while also encouraging those at lesser levels of sport to understand that taking a quick drink is not going to make you the best sportsperson in the world."
"Member of the Commission. - I think your angle is absolutely right because, if you go to a fitness centre today, even before you actually get to the machine you see the shelves full of different kinds of products, dietary supplements, energy drinks and so on. You are absolutely right that this area is very big business and that we should think very carefully about how to approach it and how to find an appropriate balance in offering the possibility for sports people to have good products but, at the same time, ensuring that they have proper information about what kind of products they are using."
"I think an information campaign on the negative consequences of this type of product would be very important."
"At consumer protection level, these products must be very clearly described and it must be very clearly marked what kind of harmful consequences the consumption of these products could bring upon sportsmen."
"I think that you are absolutely right in saying that we have to think how we can avoid the negative consequences of taking part in sport and then totally wiping out the benefits by using products which are actually harmful to health."
"Subject: Difficulties of the Slovene theatre in Trieste"
"The EU urgently needs a Commissioner for Human Rights."
"The rights of minorities are being flagrantly violated in the EU. Here is an example from Italy."
"One of the pillars of the national identity and culture of the Slovene minority in Italy is the Slovene theatre (Slovensko stalno gledališče) in Trieste, which was established as long ago as 1945 by the municipal, provincial and regional authorities of Italy."
"The theatre has always faced financial difficulties because the Italian authorities do not provide regular funding."
"The theatre had to stop performing its programme in September because of financial difficulties."
"The Italian state has an important internal and international obligation to provide for those Italian citizens who are members of the Slovene minority."
"The Italian state is not respecting the rights of its own citizens, and by preventing the theatre from operating, it is carrying out a policy of active assimilation of a minority."
"In Slovenia, this behaviour is viewed as a flagrant violation of Italy's obligations towards a minority, in this case the Slovene minority."
"What can you as European Commissioners do to preserve the Slovene theatre in Trieste, and with it the Slovene language?"
"Member of the Commission. - I would also like to thank the honourable Member for this question."
"It is clear he is trying to explore all possible avenues of how to help and improve the situation in this theatre."
"I have to start by underlining that Community action in the field of culture is based on Article 151, which provides that Community action shall be aimed at encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, supporting and supplementing their action."
"However, the decision on the allocation of national funds to cultural institutions belongs to Member States, and no Community competence allows the Commission to influence such choices."
"Nevertheless, intercultural dialogue and the promotion of cultural diversity are key objectives of the European cultural agenda, and transnational projects in this field may therefore be eligible for Community support under the culture programme."
"It aims, more specifically, at encouraging creativity and mobility of artists, public access to culture, the dissemination of art and culture, intercultural dialogue and knowledge of the history and cultural heritage of the peoples of Europe."
"Only projects with a European dimension can be financed, meaning at least three - or, in the case of multiannual projects, six - organisations from different Member States must participate in the project."
"Operating grants for a single cultural institution are only possible if the activities are carried out at European level in at least seven countries participating in the cultural programme."
"It should also be mentioned that the Commission has developed a strategy to promote multilingualism in the European Union which covers official, national, regional, minority and migrant languages."
"The communication of September 2008, 'Multilingualism: an Asset for Europe and a Shared Commitment', confirms Commission support for all languages spoken in the Community, including the languages spoken by minorities."
"This strategy is implemented in close cooperation with the Member States, who remain, however, the decision makers with respect to internal language policy."
"The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is also one of the general objectives of the lifelong learning programme."
"Under this programme, the European Union supports projects and networks to promote all languages present in the EU, including minority languages."
"In addition to that, it must be stressed that the protection of persons belonging to minorities is one of the principles on which the Union is founded."
"Therefore, the Commission considers that Member States must use all available legal instruments in order to guarantee the rights of individuals - including those belonging to national minorities - and act proactively against all sources of discrimination."
"The European Commission reaffirms its commitment to the protection of fundamental rights and non-discrimination."
"(SL) Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"It answers my question in principle, but this is not a problem of principle."
"This is a very specific problem and one that concerns people's lives."
"The Commission is, indeed, of the opinion that this is a matter which ought to fall within the competence of the Member States, but this House is of the view that not everything in Italy is working as well as it should."
"For precisely that reason, we shall be voting here tomorrow on a resolution which is a product of the debate on media freedom in Italy."
"Although, admittedly, the Commission believes that it has no authority in this regard, the majority of us here are of the view that the Commission actually is in a position to deal with such issues as well."
"The minorities issue is not merely one of citizens' rights."
"It is also an issue of the State itself being responsible for, and obliged to respect, the rights of its minorities."
"Commissioner, I am pleased that you have spoken about discrimination and countering it, but the fact is that no minority can survive unless it is granted positive discrimination."
"A minority needs extra understanding and help and extra moral, political and financial support if it is to survive."
"That is positive discrimination."
"And in this particular case, Commissioner, we are talking about an institution which was established by the aforementioned State."
"This theatre has been up and running for more than forty, fifty, years, but every year, we hear the same old story."
"Refusing to grant funding until the very end of the year is a form of political pressure, and as you yourself know, all the Slavic peoples have a similar saying: an empty bag cannot stand upright."
"What we need is concrete financial action."
"Member of the Commission. - I fully understand your preoccupation, but we in the Commission have to operate under the very clear rules established, especially for the field of budget allocations and budget disbursement."
"Therefore, I was trying in my answer to provide you with possibilities of how we, from the European level, can help Slovenian theatre."
"The only way in which the Commission can financially assist in this respect would be if the administration of the theatre could establish cooperation with their neighbours and become active in the cultural programme under the current conditions."
"This, I think, would be achievable and possible, and I believe it would also be for the benefit not only of the theatres but also for other reviewers and other partners with whom the Slovenian theatre would cooperate in the future, because only under these conditions can the Commission have a positive look at the financing of these concrete actions, which very clearly describe the element of European value added and European cooperation in this respect."
"As you know, if we do not have a special budget line for this type of project, we cannot finance them."
"I fully understand that the debate on this issue is very often very intense, because it really concerns nations, nationality and languages."
"Therefore, I think the European Parliament is very well placed to debate this issue, as you highlighted in your supplementary question."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"Modification of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (the 'Single CMO Regulation') (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) - C7-0223/2009 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking you for allowing the urgent procedure to be applied to the two proposals that I hope will help the situation in the dairy market - one proposing that milk be included in the scope of Article 186, and one regarding the management of the buy-out scheme for quotas."
"These proposals are the latest in a long series of dairy-oriented measures that we have adopted."
"I have taken note of your resolution of 17 September, and I hope you have noted that many of your recommendations are already covered in practice, covered by ongoing studies or will be covered by today's proposals."
"As regards the long-term measures mentioned in your resolution, we have set up a high level group."
"The first meeting has taken place and we expect that the final paper will be delivered before the end of June next year."
"I am very happy to be able to say that the reality today in the dairy market is that prices are increasing and we are no longer seeing any buy-up into intervention because the market prices are better than the intervention prices."
"Regarding my proposal, Article 186 is an existing provision for a large number of products, but milk is not included."
"The recent price volatility that we saw, starting in 2007, has shown that it is, or it will be, necessary to include milk under this article, because this would then allow the Commission to take faster action."
"Yesterday, in the Council of Agricultural Ministers and in COMAGRI, I also announced this EUR 280 million for dairy farmers."
"In order to be able to pay out this money quickly, I simply need the legal basis in Article 186."
"The idea will be to allocate the money in national envelopes, according to production in the year 2008-9 and, of course, within the ceiling of the national quotas, distributed in a non-discriminatory manner to those dairy farmers most affected by the crisis."
"Again, to use this possibility, we need to include milk in Article 186."
"When I say I announced the possibility of proposing EUR 280 million, you have to be aware that the budget authority, which is the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers, will have to decide on this amount at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 November."
"I also said yesterday that this is the last money that I have in my pockets, with the exception of the EUR 300 million which is necessary as a buffer to avoid financial discipline."
"It is important for me to say clearly to you that Article 186 is not a carte blanche to propose whatever ideas the Commission might get."
"At this stage, I can only say that private storage for different products - and this could include cheese - is a candidate, provided that the market situation is such that we can justify it."
"The second part of the proposal is the management of the quota system."
"The possibility already exists today for Member States to buy up quotas."
"What we are introducing here is the possibility that the Member States simply reduce the overall national ceiling of the quota with the amount of quotas they have been buying out of the market."
"This is a voluntary scheme because it has been obvious in our discussions that compulsory schemes simply would not work politically."
"I look forward to hearing your comments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that this request to use the urgent procedure was passed here in Parliament today by a large majority."
"In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility."
"In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time."
"It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible."
"That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all."
"The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely."
"The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all."
"Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council."
"Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas."
"The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force."
"The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed."
"Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years."
"If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension."
"Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million."
"Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament."
"I know that you do not have any more money available to you."
"I ask that the - possibly amended - motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday."
"Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to take the opportunity to say how pleased I am at the responsibility shown this morning by the House when it adopted the urgent procedure to include the dairy sector under Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation, along with many other agricultural products."
"The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular."
"At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament's requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis."
"Parliament's openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation."
"I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, could I, too, thank the Commissioner for coming here tonight to further explain the powers she seeks."
"Commissioner, could I first of all thank you for responding positively to the resolution agreed with this House on 27 September."
"I welcome the moves you have taken to try and stabilise what is a very serious situation for dairy farmers."
"I also welcome the EUR 280 million that you have announced for restructuring."
"In terms of the first part of your proposal, the question we all have to ask today is: why are we being asked to approve urgency measures at this late stage, and will they assist market recovery?"
"Because clearly, as you said in your speech, the green shoots of recovery are already starting to show."
"I am not convinced that the proposed quota changes will make a great deal of difference but, as they are voluntary on Member States, this group will certainly not oppose them being granted."
"Turning to the proposal on widening the scope of Article 186 to include milk and milk products, in my experience, ministers - or in this case commissioners - usually come to parliaments asking for powers so they can take action to solve a problem."
"Tonight, we seem to be being asked to grant the powers to the Commission without first being told exactly what action they will be used to address."
"As I understand from your contribution early on, you did mention that you needed this extra power as a legal basis to pay out the EUR 280 million."
"I would be grateful if you could clarify whether that is the case."
"Is that why you require the powers?"
"Because the great concern we all have is that we may well be handing over a blank cheque to the Commission."
"Commissioner, you said you had been financially plucked of your last feather, so, if you have other ideas for action you might take, clearly there is not much financial scope to do anything at all significant."
"Our group will only grant these powers if they are time limited and they are constrained to extreme circumstances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, finally there is movement in this debate."
"The Commission must now bear the overall responsibility again."
"This morning, we saw something different, although we would have liked Parliament to have been more involved."
"Let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support."
"We must be clear, however, that such support is just a drop in the ocean, in the truest sense of the expression."
"The decisions made in Luxembourg unfortunately also did not help us bring about a rebalancing of supply and demand - which is, of course, the crucial element here."
"The voluntary buying up of quotas is all well and good, but it will not have a major impact as it does not contribute significantly to a reduction in volume."
"I already mentioned yesterday that we must give proper consideration to the Court of Auditors' report and set about implementing a policy aimed at the long term and that we need to look at what the Court of Auditors has said."
"The Court said that we need supplies to be managed in future or else the whole system will be incapable of being financed, and we need a dairy policy based on quality products in the European market."
"We must move away from export refunds as quickly as possible - this is an old demand on our part and we have often pointed out the disastrous consequences of these measures."
"We really need a policy that goes beyond this current crisis and we also expect longer-term answers from the Commission."
"Regrettably, the Commission has not given us such answers so far, specifically as regards how we need to strengthen the producer organisations in order to give them more market power and restrain the supermarket chains."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I certainly welcome this decision, and I think the debate last night in the committee and tonight in plenary allows us to bring more clarity to the situation."
"The reality, and I think the cause of the frustration that many dairy farmers feel, is that while they have seen to some extent what Mr Lyon referred to as the green shoots emerging, this money has not passed through into their bank accounts yet."
"So this does create a degree of frustration for the dairy farmers."
"Many have been under financial pressure for a long time."
"It is a good and useful thing that we can talk, because I do now accept the need for Article 186 to be brought into place so that we can get this money direct to the producers as fast as we possibly can."
"I think that is the challenge."
"I like Mr Deß's idea of an amendment, and if he puts it forward I think I would like to support that amendment for a limit of two or even three years to get this job done."
"However, I remain unconvinced by the buy-out scheme."
"We must do this to protect the industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am obliged to tell you again, this evening, that the financial provisions that you are proposing are a mere drop in the ocean when it comes to the crisis and the despair in which farmers are living today."
"You are going to release EUR 280 million, when only a few weeks ago it was going to be EUR 600 million."
"You are therefore going to give a one-off payment of EUR 1 000 to farmers who are now losing EUR 100 to 200 per day."
"We are therefore calling for a real emergency financial plan, not a plaster to treat a life-threatening illness."
"On the other hand, you want to use public money for a huge plan to slaughter dairy cattle and to shut farms."
"In so doing, you are going to destroy the future of our farmers, as it is the young farmers who will be the hardest hit, the smallest farmers, those who develop the land, who produce milk products and quality cheese, and who preserve the environment."
"How dare you propose that, when so many families, in Europe and elsewhere, do not have access to food, starting with milk!"
"I would add that, with your plan, we will have a milk shortage in the future."
"The fact is, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is being pitched so strongly to us, we can only be surprised that you should want to enforce this Article 186 of the regulation, which will give you full powers."
"You had these full powers, though, and it was these that led you to opt for the liberalisation of quotas that is plunging us into the crisis that we are in today, for the sole benefit of manufacturers and distributors, because, even today, the European Court of Auditors points out that, between 2000 and 2007, the consumer prices of milk products increased by 17% while the producer prices fell by 6%."
"Commissioner, I say to you once again that there is an urgent, a very urgent, need to provide a huge amount of help to the agricultural sector by means of a major European emergency fund, to return to a policy of minimum agricultural prices, and not to let the capitalist market destroy our farmers."
"(HU) Commissioner, I will, of course, vote in favour of the proposal, even though I am aware that this handout will not resolve the situation for farmers."
"However, I have three questions to ask."
"The first one is as follows. What do you see as the lesson from this crisis?"
"Have we learnt any lesson from it?"
"Commissioner, this crisis has not been caused by any kind of natural disaster, tsunami or other similar event, but by a series of bad decisions and a basically failed agricultural policy."
"Looking at the future, what can you promise farmers?"
"How will they avoid a similar crisis in the future?"
"I would like to hear a clear-cut, detailed answer from you."
"Now for my next question."
"You said yesterday at the Committee hearing that Member States can freely use this sum of money."
"What does this mean exactly?"
"Will Member States be able to distribute this money fairly so that it is not given to farming's big business and large farms, but to smallholders, family farmers who are most in need and whose livelihood depends on it?"
"These farmers have ended up in the direst situation."
"The other large group that should be considered are farmers in the new Member States, especially smallholders."
"How do you want to get rid of this intolerable discrimination which derives from the fact that we Hungarians, for instance, had to hand over our markets lock, stock and barrel to the European Union, but we have received only a fraction of the subsidies?"
"How and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated?"
"(IT) Mr President, Mrs Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commissioner's approach in deciding to come before Parliament to set out the package of measures in the dairy sector."
"With reference to the content of the proposed measures, despite a lack of adequate operational details for them, I think that things are moving in the right direction towards solving the problems which our farmers are currently experiencing."
"I do not believe, however, that the proposed measures alone can solve the problems we are facing."
"Nevertheless, I think it is vital to vote in favour of the proposal to amend Articles 78 and 79 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007."
"With regard to Article 186 of the same CMO Regulation, I would point out first of all that paragraphs a) and b) of this article lay down different levels of protection for different goods, intervening for some when prices rise and fall significantly, whereas for others - pigmeat, olive oil and other products - only when prices rise significantly."
"I think this is an unacceptable discrepancy."
"I would like to put forward, also on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), an amendment with the aim of ensuring that the Commission informs Parliament prior to undertaking the measures set out in Article 186, and I think that this amendment is compatible with what the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament just proposed."
"Lastly, I call on the Commissioner to increase, as requested in Parliament's resolution of 17 September, the amount of de minimis aid for all productive sectors regardless of the national ceilings currently in place."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, we are all unfortunately aware of the grave state of the dairy sector in Europe."
"My political group has been calling for months for the adoption of urgent measures to try to save thousands of farmers threatened with ruin."
"We have adopted our own initiatives and backed initiatives by other political groups in order to achieve this."
"That leaves us with little choice but to welcome the Commission's initiatives, however inadequate they may seem to us."
"That was also why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament voted this morning in favour of the urgent procedure that was put before us."
"We will, however, propose and demand that the European Parliament be kept permanently informed of the measures which will be adopted over the coming days, under the powers which we now transfer to the Commission."
"We will continue to do our utmost to restore the balance of the market, so that it can guarantee adequate returns to the producers, as reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(SV) Mr President, obviously it is necessary to take action promptly when crises occur in certain sectors, such as has happened with banking, with the car industry and with dairy farmers."
"However, such crises recur again and again."
"Perhaps it will not be dairy next time."
"Perhaps it will be cereals, or something else."
"If I may take the discussion slightly beyond the actual scope of this debate, we cannot keep addressing only the immediate problems."
"We also need to find the time and the energy and the political planning to bring about a Common Agricultural Policy for Europe which is strong, sustainable, flexible and which removes the worst consequences of the price instability that we can expect."
"I want the countryside to be viable in Europe, and the countryside cannot survive without farmers and animals!"
"(DE) Mr President, unfortunately, Mr Bové cannot be here tonight, so I am speaking again."
"I have more questions for the Commissioner."
"Does she really, seriously believe that paying out this money will end the protests?"
"As I said earlier, I believe that Parliament's decision this morning equated to granting the Commission a blank cheque because we do not know what it will do with it."
"I will say it again: the Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually part of the problem."
"I stand by that view."
"Yet I also simply accept the decision - as you have to see the facts as they are and this is what has been decided - and I would say to the other Members that we must limit these measures."
"We should limit them to a manageable period, so that we in Parliament can also get our hand back on the tiller."
"I have another question for you, Commissioner, as it is repeatedly said for all the programmes that we need to continue to promote restructuring."
"So what do you mean by restructuring?"
"Do you really think it is right that we continue to give out money in order basically to encourage smaller-scale farmers to give up so that we can give money to the bigger farms?"
"This policy is no longer an effective means to an end."
"We must ensure that we employ the money in a targeted way, specifically in the disadvantaged regions, in order to maintain the structures in those regions that are in greatest jeopardy."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission acknowledges the failure of its policy for the dairy sector, but leaves its disastrous basic policy guidelines for the sector untouched."
"The millions mentioned here are far below the amount needed to compensate producers for the falling prices that they have been suffering."
"Contrary to what is claimed, it is necessary to reverse the route that the CAP has been heading down, where successive reforms have dismantled the instruments to regulate the market, quotas and production rights, leading many thousands of producers to gradually abandon the sector."
"Thousands of jobs are in the balance: whole families who depend on farming, and the dairy sector in particular."
"Vast regions are at stake, where the land will be increasingly abandoned, with drastic social and environmental consequences."
"All this cries out for immediate intervention to restore fair prices for producers, but this will require more resources than those now being made available."
"Above all, and we repeat, the situation demands measures with a greater scope that are not merely palliative, such as the cancellation of the annual increase in milk quotas, returning them to the levels in place prior to the decision to increase them, and the repeal of the decision to abolish the quota system in 2015."
"Mr President, like the majority of Members of this House, I voted today to support the urgent procedure in relation to Article 186."
"Any financial aid to the dairy sector is imperative to its survival, especially the survival of small family farms as we find in Northern Ireland."
"If, as you say, Commissioner, you need the changes to Article 186 to trigger the EUR 280 million fund, then it will have my broad support."
"We can only hope that the money is paid and distributed quickly."
"Many farmers have waited too long to have the aid that is required."
"I am, however, underwhelmed by the proposals concerning Articles 65 to 84."
"It is almost certain that these will not impact on the UK, and I have a number of questions surrounding them, particularly in that I feel it will create an uneven playing field between the regions of Europe and it seems contradictory in the light of the Commission's current policy."
"(FR) Mr President, there has to be consistency in politics."
"Over the last few weeks, many of us in this House have demanded measures from the Commission."
"When solutions are proposed to us, we will vote in favour of those solutions, even if - I agree with what has been said - they are slow in coming and even if they have had to be extracted by means of the positions adopted both within the European Parliament and among ministers."
"This amount, which will be useful in the very short term, does not resolve, as many have already said, the long-term issues concerning the way in which the planned end of quotas is dealt with."
"If we want to be in a position to cope with and to prevent repeated crises within the agricultural produce sector, there is no way that we can do so without production regulation and control tools or without a combination of the two."
"That is not the issue at stake this evening, however."
"The issue at stake this evening, the only issue that counts at the moment, is that of Article 186."
"Commissioner, I have one simple question: in concrete terms, what is Article 186 meant to do, and from when and in what way?"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, a month ago, we debated a Parliament resolution here and the proposals for the intervention in the dairy sector."
"Today we are dealing with two new measures: the change in the management of the quotas and the measure on Article 186, measures which we agree to process urgently, as you have requested."
"However, Commissioner, the sector needs to be considered as a whole, and it is not good to have this trickle of proposals on a matter that we have been dealing with for several months now."
"We demand common, European solutions."
"In this respect, the reported increase in minimum aid for all sectors will cause distortions between Member States and make it difficult to apply the CAP in a uniform way."
"To conclude, one final thought: aid of EUR 280 million is being considered, which we do of course welcome, but I would like to remind you, Commissioner, that this Parliament adopted a resolution raising the need for an additional fund of EUR 600 million to deal with the crisis in the dairy sector."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a farmer, I see the tabled amendment of Articles 78 and 79 as a deviation by the Commission from its hitherto sound route through agricultural reform at the expense of efficient and forward-looking farms."
"It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto."
"It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover."
"I therefore reject this amendment."
"It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament's call for urgent measures for its own ends."
"It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament's consent through this amendment of Article 186."
"I therefore reject this amendment."
"However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis."
"This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the dairy industry is in crisis, and I want to record my thanks here and compliment the Commissioner on her very timely actions, which I think were precisely right."
"I think EUR 280 million is a realistic sum and will be welcome within the industry."
"I am persuaded that it will be necessary to grant powers under Article 186 in order to deliver this benefit in a timely manner to the producers, so it has my support."
"It has my support, although I prefer that we limit this concession until 2013 at the latest."
"With regard to the national quota buy-back scheme, which I note will include powers to raise super levies from producers exceeding quotas, I have reservations."
"I think it is penalising the efficient and progressive producers - often the young men, the young people who are the very future lifeblood of our industry - and I think it is sending all the wrong messages."
"We live in a very volatile marketplace, and what this industry needs is not short-term reactions but long-term strategy."
"I have been a long-time supporter of the Commissioner for her long-term vision for the future of the industry, and I would encourage her to go down that path, which is long-term strategy, not short-term reaction."
"(PL) Mr President, I hope that the milk producers now have the worst behind them."
"This hope is strengthened by the decision to support milk producers with a sum of EUR 280 million next year."
"A fundamental question, however, remains: what should be done about milk production and milk producers in the long term?"
"The most important question in this matter is the future of milk production quotas."
"At present, there are two approaches."
"The first, which is the effect of the review of the common agricultural policy, increases production quotas gradually, and aims to lift them in 2015."
"The second approach, which is contained in the present proposal of the European Commission, aims to limit milk supply by a new method of calculating the charge for exceeding the national quota."
"These two approaches contradict each other."
"Personally, I am in favour of maintaining the quotas, but only when the breakdown of quotas among EU countries and producers is based on objective and fair criteria."
"The development and adoption of such fair and objective criteria would be very difficult, but perhaps it is worth making the attempt."
"If we are talking about extension - I fully support the extension of Article 186, but I think this should be accompanied by a definition of the role of the Commission and the instruments it will be able to use."
"Mr President, I would say this to the Commissioner: If you will forgive the pun, the milk crisis is something the Commission has made a pig's ear of, a saying we have in Ireland when somebody has made a complete hash of something."
"Only 18 months ago, you were saying that milk prices would increase substantially, only to see them fall by half in some countries."
"This is why the Commission must be able to intervene more quickly in the market, and this motion is positive in that respect."
"In my constituency of Munster in Ireland, many in the dairy industry, both big and small farmers, and particularly family farms, are just subsisting or are just teetering close to bankruptcy."
"They are looking at their difficulties and the paltry amounts being offered while others, like banks and bankers, are being bailed out to the tune of huge sums."
"(The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)"
"The EUR 280 million milk fund announced yesterday is welcome but is merely a sticking plaster over a much wider problem."
"The House voted last September that EUR 600 million should be made available."
"In the interests of showing solidarity with small farmers in particular, this figure should be maintained."
"The next priority for the Commission must be to address the whole issue of milk supply."
"I firmly believe this."
"Until this is addressed, we will be facing more problems and we are quickly going to run out of sticking plasters."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, yes, we should agree to milk being incorporated into Article 186, and I hope that we will do so tomorrow."
"We cannot always criticise the Commission for acting too slowly, for lagging behind, for saying that there is still a silver lining that is not there in reality."
"The Commission now has the chance to act quickly and we should grant it this chance and in so doing, we should always demonstrate our own willingness to hold it to account."
"Mr Deß's amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will enable us to do that together."
"The EUR 280 million that many have spoken about is just a drop in the ocean."
"We must also recognise, though, that it is the end of the financial year."
"We have to understand that there simply is no more money available."
"How should we handle the overall situation?"
"We would like to see those dairy farmers who have been hardest hit by the crisis receive the EUR 280 million."
"We talk about the milk market, but these are real people and the rural areas that we discuss and that we are always saying we want to protect when we are debating other subjects."
"Commissioner, support the dairy fund!"
"This afternoon, the Commissioner speaking in the budget debate spoke out in favour of the fund, I want to make that quite clear."
"I was very pleased about it."
"We also need this signal urgently, and this money, too, is within the 2010 budget."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I too am delighted at the approval of the urgent procedure in this Chamber, as I think that the inclusion of the milk issue in Article 186 is both timely and important."
"I have argued that a situation as serious as the one faced by the dairy sector requires urgent measures to defend the sector, for both economic and social reasons."
"I actually come from a country, Portugal, and a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and embedded in regions that are socially rather fragile and where, in fact, it would be vital to maintain the quota system beyond 2015."
"The measures proposed here are somewhat flimsy, but they are nonetheless necessary and imperative."
"I am also worried about how the Commission will use the new powers it is to be given, especially since it has acted in quite an insensitive way in this crisis, putting forward weak measures, too late, and only under intense pressure."
"In view of this, I would like the Commission to submit an annex to Article 186, setting out measures which can be used for a radical intervention in the dairy sector so as to ensure its sustainability."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I very much welcome your motion."
"There is one point that I feel the need to criticise, however, which is the voluntary buy-up programme for milk quotas."
"A programme of this kind, if it is to succeed, must be obligatory, not voluntary."
"I find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quotas counterproductive."
"I believe this not only because this arrangement will initially mean that we retain a quota increase which it will then be very difficult to rein back in."
"By buying back the milk quotas, we will be giving them a financial value again, and the main effect of that will be that it hampers the ability to do the balancing out."
"I feel I must reject any measure that restricts balancing out."
"Particularly in the phasing out period for the milk quotas, balancing out is a necessary tool in order for individual farms to be able to orient themselves better in the market."
"For the reasons I have mentioned, I will be forced to reject this part of the motion, although I will vote in favour of the motion as a whole."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we are going to adopt measures aimed at a partial solution for the crisis in the dairy sector."
"Everyone here is aware of the livestock rearing situation for our farmers and we know what these measures mean for them and their families."
"Our farmers do not want to be constantly subsidised."
"They are asking us to be able to do the work in a dignified way, selling their products at respectable, fair prices that are in line with the effort and investment they have put in."
"Commissioner, apart from the boost and the confidence that we can give our farmers with these new measures, we are on the way to future reforms, major reforms that will be discussed further in Parliament."
"Mr President, the most important words that came from the Commissioner are that market prices are beginning to rise."
"We should acknowledge that in this House and push to ensure that they are passed on to farmers."
"We are saying there is EUR 280 million available to them, but every additional cent they receive is worth much more than the doling out of payments to them."
"That is most important."
"I think it is important that some have criticised the Commission hugely."
"Let us acknowledge that intervention and export refunds have been used to maintain prices, even with that horribly low price for producers, so I think some of the criticism is unnecessary and harsh."
"I support the extension of Article 186 if you needed to pay out this EUR 280 million, which I regard as symbolic rather than significant."
"Let us look at the lessons."
"We need to look at what is going to happen to CAP reform post-2013; the high-level group is focusing on it."
"I would say to those political groups who tonight support funding for dairying: make sure that you also support a properly funded common agricultural policy after 2013; otherwise your words are empty."
"(FR) Mr President, please excuse me, I was supposed to come earlier, but I was tied up."
"I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg."
"I believe that the Council's decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is 'restructuring'."
"In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today."
"Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped - this appears in the text - will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota."
"Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out."
"This is the wrong approach."
"The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million - the figure has already been quoted - equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year."
"That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through."
"Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission."
"(RO) I would like to ask the Commissioner a question, as well as thank her for appearing before the House."
"You said that the resources promised for the funds to support the dairy sector will be allocated to Member States according to an historical factor, in other words, based on the negotiated quotas."
"However, many Member States claim that these quotas are unfair."
"In fact, this is the reason why many Member States insist that the market should be deregulated."
"For example, some states cannot even produce enough to cover their own consumption."
"Do you not think that using an historical factor will maintain these injustices..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I will have to summarise my question so as not to exceed the time allotted to me by too much."
"The Commissioner said that the resources will be allocated to Member States according to an historical factor."
"However, many Member States claim that the quotas currently allocated are unfair."
"In fact, this is also the reason why many Member States insist that the market should be deregulated."
"Do you not think that using an historical factor would maintain these injustices?"
"(BG) I would like to welcome the decision made by the Council and Commission to allocate an additional package of EUR 280 million in subsidies for dairy production in 2010."
"This sends out a clear signal to all those who are suffering the adverse consequences of the crisis every day."
"I urge that this adequate response will not be a one-off economic solution, but part of a targeted, long-term strategy for restoring, stabilising and developing this sector in Europe."
"This is why it is important to take into consideration the measures which each Member State is going to adopt."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that Bulgaria can only partially accept the proposals to amend Regulation 1234."
"We insist that it is explicitly recorded in the draft that the opportunities to manage national milk quotas will be exercised at Member States' discretion."
"It is important that the option is retained to choose the existing scheme for buying up and redistributing milk quotas through the national reserve."
"We can ill afford either to hold back or collect payment from producers as the Bulgarian sector is in the process of being modernised."
"Otherwise, Bulgarian producers will not be competitive even after 2015."
"(PL) Mr President, we are, of course, pleased to accept these new solutions, which are intended to help farmers, including farmers in Poland."
"However, it should also be remembered that when we are talking about money - and it is money which we are talking about - the way in which the money is actually distributed is important."
"It should reach those who are feeling the effects of the crisis the most, because I will not agree to a policy under which we give everyone an equal amount, which means a small amount, so that, in fact, quite literally, we do not help anyone."
"Secondly, I would like, if I may, to refer to history before turning to the future in a moment."
"I am sure we remember the wonderful years, over a year ago now, when the farmers were getting a very good price for milk."
"At the same time, they were benefiting from large EU subsidies for modernisation of the dairy sector."
"Therefore, it is important that we plan the future based on this experience, and that we draw conclusions from our mistakes, because mistakes were certainly made."
"It is equally important for us to think about how to plan the development of this sector, since money is available both as direct subsidies and also for the development of rural areas."
"In addition, we have the instrument of milk quotas at our disposal."
"(PL) Commissioner, I would like to ask you this question: What does the Commission want to spend the EUR 280 million on?"
"On further restructuring, or better, perhaps, as 21 Member States wanted, on an injection for the market, on market mechanisms?"
"In fact, the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms."
"Currently, they are not able to take out further loans or to improve productivity."
"They are not able, at the moment, to continue with modernisation, because they have lost liquidity."
"They do not want to buy refrigerators or milking machines now, this is not the time for further investment."
"The EUR 280 million works out at not quite EUR 2 per tonne of milk produced in the European Union."
"When the European Commission proposes what it calls a 'mechanism for management of the quota system', it really wants to limit production."
"We should consider whether we will not see a repeat of the situation which followed reform of the sugar market, and which has meant that we now have problems with the supply of that resource."
"Is now the time for restrictions on the production of milk or cereals?"
"I am sure that is not what we want."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased, Commissioner, that, just a few weeks after this House adopted a resolution on milk, you are here bringing forward measures to meet our demands."
"I agree with your proposal, in respect of Article 186, including with the time limit, which seems reasonable to me."
"I am also in favour of the differentiated granting of quotas that you propose."
"I have to say that the proposal concerning the buying back of quotas leaves me more perplexed."
"You yourself said over weeks and months that the current crisis was not caused by the quota system and, with that in mind, personally I do not think that this buy-back proposal is completely coherent."
"Finally, I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet."
"We must continue to take steps, and specifically as regards the dairy sector in difficult areas, in mountain areas, where there are simply no alternatives to dairy farming."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks for the EUR 280 million."
"I really hope, above all, that the full extent of this money reaches our 40 000 Austrian dairy farmers, as they really need it."
"You are surely aware of the situation in mountain regions and the situation in small-scale family farms."
"Commissioner, Austria was always against the phasing out of the quotas."
"OK, you have chosen your path and followed it consistently."
"We will, of course, attempt to prepare our farmers for it and to help them with it as much as possible."
"With the best will in the world, I cannot understand your proposal for a voluntary quota buy-up programme."
"If we apply this, it will result in an appreciation in value and price of exactly the quotas that you are phasing out."
"How are we supposed to explain that to the farmers of Austria?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, having listened carefully to the discussion here tonight, I think you might get the impression from some speeches that this is the first step we are taking to help the dairy sector within the European Union."
"Nothing could be more wrong."
"I am quite sure that at least some of you know what has been going on since January this year when we started on the public and private storage, we started intervention, and we started export refunds."
"We have been taking lots of different measures over the summer so I think we should devise a special study to tell the new Members of this Parliament exactly what has been going on since last January."
"On the specific points on the two proposals here today, I have to repeat again that the buy-up scheme is not a new scheme."
"It is already there for Member States to use if they want to help specific dairy farmers out of business."
"It is an offer, and that is why I do not want to make it compulsory; it is a possibility for helping farmers out of business."
"The quota they buy out can be kept in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if Member States so wish."
"This was one part of the discussion."
"The other part, which has aroused by far the most interest today, is Article 186."
"The reason for introducing dairy farming into Article 186 is the fact that we need to be able to react fast."
"By the way, I do not see any reason why dairy farming should not be part of Article 186, as areas specifically within the meat sector are already there."
"And, in general, those who fear that the Commission will get a blank cheque and do whatever they want should keep in mind that Article 186 is normally by nature a very positive scheme where it is possible to try to help people who are in difficulties by reacting very fast."
"So it is not a blank cheque."
"It will be discussed, as you probably know, in the Management Committee."
"I have listened to your ideas concerning a more limited period of three or four years."
"I think it would disqualify dairy farmers - but of course I have listened to what you say."
"Then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round."
"This EUR 280 million is not for restructuring."
"It simply offers a possibility of paying out very quickly as soon as we have the formalities in place, with the acceptance from the Ecofin meeting in November and the signing of the budget for 2010."
"This means we can act immediately, which would not be the case if we do not have Article 186 in place."
"So it is not restructuring."
"As I said before, it gives Member States the possibility of paying the most needy from this national budget."
"How should it be distributed?"
"I have clearly said it has to be on the basis of production."
"I can hear that there may be other ideas but if we start discussing internally how to distribute, then I think it would take at least to the end of next year because there would be so many great ideas we would never be able to find a common line on this issue."
"I will reply to some of the specific questions."
"I would like to say that producer organisations are an excellent option."
"It is actually necessary."
"I have said that clearly in plenary before, specifically when discussing the fruit and vegetable scheme."
"If farmers spend their time and efforts competing against each other instead of competing with the strong retail sector, I know who the winners and the losers will be."
"Therefore I say: do work together to be a much stronger body in the whole food chain."
"I completely agree with you that we have a global problem, that we have one billion people starving, not being able to get what they need to eat every day."
"That is why I was hurt to see European farmers spreading milk all over the fields in a situation where we are facing starvation problems globally."
"That is not the best image for European agriculture."
"I have to say that I am very impressed at the way in which two Members, Mr Bové and Mr Häusling, managed to gear their speaking time."
"I noticed very carefully how it was done."
"I do not know if it is a new procedure of the House that one speaker can substitute for another who then goes in to speak under catch-the-eye."
"It was quite smart, I would say."
"(Applause)"
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Commissioner, having long struggled to have these measures put forward by the Commission, we are in no position to reject any contribution you may bring us at this very difficult time for dairy farmers and their families."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has taken a long time to act."
"It has only done so when faced with intense pressure from dairy producers, the European Parliament and 21 Member States."
"I would make the following points on the measures that you have presented here:"
"1: The fund of EUR 280 million is too little compared with the amount of EUR 600 million unanimously deemed necessary by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the committee with both technical and political expertise in this matter."
"This policy statement was approved by the European Parliament itself."
"We cannot, therefore, consider less than half the sum that Parliament deemed essential only a month ago to be sufficient."
"2: The inclusion of milk in Article 186 gives the Commission an operational tool that can be deployed instantly, but that does not mean that Parliament will no longer monitor the issue."
"We still need instruments to regulate the market."
"We should maintain the quota system and introduce transparency into the milk marketing chain."
"Without these two instruments, it will be impossible to restore and guarantee stability in Europe's rural areas."
"I welcome the measures proposed by the European Commission to help Europe's dairy producers."
"However, these measures can only alleviate the crisis, but cannot end it altogether."
"In order to do this, the decisions regarding the milk quota increases should be dropped."
"However, neither the European Commission, nor Mariann Fischer Boel personally, is inclined to acknowledge that wrong decisions have been made."
"I agree with the European farmers' demand to drop the quota increase."
"I also oppose the permanent abolition of the quota system scheduled for 2015."
"I concur with the point of view of the largest European farmers organisation COPA-COGECA, which is that the dairy market requires regulation after 2015 as well."
"The important lesson to be learned from the current crisis is that the dairy market needs to be regulated."
"Without this, prices will become unpredictable."
"European dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large-scale price volatility."
"On the subject of the current emergency measures, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the increase in the minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems for Member States in a more difficult budgetary situation."
"What I am afraid of is that in these countries, such as Hungary, the governments will not provide the maximum support."
"As a result, farmers in these countries may end up at an even bigger competitive disadvantage."
"I am confident that during the vote on the 2010 budget taking place on Thursday, the European Parliament will support the proposed amendment, submitted by a number of Members including myself, which would increase support for the school milk programme."
"The rallies that milk producers have been carrying out for weeks in a bid to save their crisis-hit sector have been answered by the European Commission with the creation of a EUR 280 million 'milk fund'."
"Mrs Fischer Boel has therefore succumbed to the pressure after turning a deaf ear, for weeks on end, to the distress of farmers on the brink of bankruptcy."
"However, this financial measure is derisory and is intended merely to calm the producers down for a while."
"It will do nothing to solve the problem of a sector that is on its way out with the planned end of milk quotas."
"Milk producers do not want charity or handouts, they want the market to be regulated so that they can sell their milk at prices that will allow them to live a dignified life from their efforts and to guarantee their children's future."
"Through its stubborn desire to impose the dogma of free and fair competition, the European Union is going to leave thousands of farmers at the mercy of the law of the market, and that alone."
"This is the same ultraliberalism that each month makes thousands of industrial workers unemployed."
"The carnage must be stopped now as a matter of urgency."
"I welcome the agreement in principle reached by agricultural ministers at their council meeting in Luxembourg on providing specific aid to the dairy sector of EUR 280 million."
"At EU level, this amounts to an additional one cent in aid per litre of milk, which is absolutely negligible."
"After putting up bold resistance for several months, the European Commission gave in slightly to the pressure exerted by farmers, 21 Member States, including Hungary, and the European Parliament, which already demanded additional resources for the sector during their informal meeting held in Brussels last Monday."
"In spite of the tardy measures from the EU, the Hungarian Government has acted quickly to support dairy farmers and has done everything to help them, taking into account the budget resources available."
"Hungary has helped the dairy sector by using all the sums that can be reallocated as part of rural development resources and the European Economic Development Programme."
"Apart from us, only Latvia and Malta have such outstanding indicators."
"Hungarian dairy farmers will receive directly around EUR 3.3 million from the EUR 280 million envelope, roughly equivalent to HUF 890 million."
"The Hungarian government can freely decide how to use this money."
"The Commission only made the suggestion that the most needy producers should receive this special aid, which coincides with Hungarian objectives."
"Following approval of the 2010 budget, this sum will be paid out at the start of next year."

"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 21.10)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Preparation of the European Council (29 and 30 October 2009) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation of the European Council."
"Mr President, next week, we have a meeting of the European Council."
"We have a comprehensive agenda, which includes many issues that affect the welfare of us all."
"We will be discussing the issues of combating climate change, finding ways to lead the EU out of the financial and economic crisis, promoting energy security and dealing with the problem of illegal migration."
"The European Union will be best prepared to tackle all of these issues if we have clarity on the issue of the Treaty."
"It is important for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force as soon as possible so that, among other things, we can continue the work of appointing the new Commission."
"That is why the European Council will also look at these issues."
"I will begin with the issues in which I know there is a strong interest in the European Parliament."
"At the end of next week, the Heads of State or Government will attempt to obtain clarity on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and how the process will proceed."
"The overwhelming 'yes' vote in Ireland and the signature of the Polish President have given the work renewed vigour, but, as you all know, the Treaty cannot enter into force until all of the Member States have ratified it - 26 of the 27 have done so, but we are still waiting for the Czech Republic."
"The country's lower house and Senate approved the Treaty, but then 17 senators petitioned the Czech constitutional court to examine whether the Treaty of Lisbon is compatible with the Czech constitution."
"We must, of course, respect the democratic process in the Czech Republic."
"On 27 October, in other words next week, the country's constitutional court will hold a public hearing on this matter."
"We believe that the court will give its ruling very shortly afterwards, but we still do not have a date for this."
"As you know, President Klaus has also stipulated certain conditions for signing the Treaty."
"We are waiting and attempting to find out exactly what these requirements and conditions will be."
"The debate in the European Council will therefore depend to a large extent on what happens in the Czech Republic."
"The statement by the Czech constitutional court and the subsequent procedure will be crucial for determining when the Treaty of Lisbon can enter into force."
"In the European Council, we will also be discussing the preparations that have so far been made to ensure that the entry into force of the Treaty goes as smoothly as possible."
"In this connection, the Presidency will present a report describing the state of play with regard to all of these issues."
"In this report, we will present the Member States' views on issues relating, for example, to the European External Action Service - an issue that we will debate here this afternoon - the scope of this Service, its legal position, staffing and financing."
"I have read Mr Brok's report, which was adopted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on Monday."
"As I said, we will discuss this in more detail this afternoon."
"I can already say that, for next week's meeting, this report will provide guidance for the High Representative's considerations to enable him or her, once the Treaty has entered into force, to very quickly produce a formal proposal for how the European External Action Service will function."
"The Council should be able to adopt this proposal very quickly, hopefully some time during the next few months."
"We have discussed many of these issues with the European Parliament and we hope that this will continue over the coming weeks."
"The major issue at the European Council meeting will be climate change."
"Our aim is for the Council to take appropriate decisions, including on the issue of financing, so that the EU can continue to play the necessary leading role and thereby contribute to a successful outcome in Copenhagen."
"At the Ecofin meeting yesterday, there was a long and involved discussion of the financing issue."
"The Presidency did its utmost to reach an agreement, but it decided in the end that this matter has to be decided by the European Council."
"Further debates are needed in some Member States to enable us to make progress in this regard."
"It is extremely important that we agree so that this process does not falter."
"At this stage in the international negotiations, we are well aware of the difficulties we are facing."
"Therefore, the EU, with an agreement on the issue of financing, could bring us a good deal further on in the negotiations."
"The European Council meeting comes at an opportune time, shortly before the negotiation session of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Barcelona and the meeting of the G20 finance ministers in St Andrews."
"We will only reach agreement in Copenhagen if all parties take action."
"Right now, the EU's environment ministers are meeting to discuss the conclusions concerning climate change."
"The aim is to be able to give a comprehensive picture of the EU's position on the issues that are currently under negotiation."
"An important part of the Environment Council's conclusions will be to clarify the EU's strategy for a long-term reduction in emissions and to attempt to reach an agreement that may facilitate our decision regarding raising our emissions reduction target from 20 to 30% compared with 1990 levels."
"The Environment Council's conclusions will also deal with the question of a decision concerning the EU's proposal in the negotiations on emissions reductions for international aviation and maritime transport, develop the EU's strategy for measures in developing countries with regard to measurement, reporting and verification of investments and the role of sectoral mechanisms, and will further develop the EU's strategy to combat deforestation and forest degradation in order to speed up the negotiations."
"The European Council will also evaluate the progress made in creating a new framework for the EU's supervision of the financial markets."
"As you know, the Heads of State or Government reached a very ambitious agreement in June with the goal of setting up a special body that will be responsible for the macro-supervision of the EU's financial system and three European supervisory authorities for the banking, insurance and securities markets."
"At the end of September, the Commission tabled its package of legislative proposals."
"This is one of the Presidency's absolute top priorities and we have established an ambitious timetable."
"Our goal is to have an agreement on the whole package by the end of the year."
"I am therefore very pleased that the Ecofin Council was yesterday able to take a major step forward and reach a broad political agreement on setting up the new macro-supervisory body without pre-empting the debate in the national parliaments."
"The Swedish Presidency was also asked by the finance ministers to continue the dialogue with the European Parliament."
"We have had very good experience of this dialogue and we think that it works well."
"It is now important to take the opportunity to push the work forward as quickly as possible."
"We need to show that we are doing our utmost to prevent future crises and that we are shouldering our shared responsibility by ensuring that consumers and investors regain their trust in the financial system."
"I would also like to say a few words about employment in Europe - an issue that I know the European Council will discuss."
"Recently, we have noticed cautious indications of a recovery in the economy."
"However, the situation on the labour markets is expected to get worse yet and we will still need stimulus and support measures."
"One issue that it is important for the European Council to highlight is how we will be able to deal with the consequences of the crisis while, at the same time, meeting our long-term goal of increasing the labour supply."
"A high level of employment is required for sustainable public finances."
"A high level of employment is also necessary for economic growth, for people's welfare and for a socially more cohesive Europe."
"In this connection I would also like to remind you of what we said regarding exit strategies."
"The finance ministers confirmed that the recovery is real, but fragile."
"It is therefore important for us to continue with the expansive financial policy."
"Talks at the Council meeting led to an agreement to formulate strategies on the basis of the principles discussed by the finance ministers at their informal meeting in Gothenburg."
"I would also like to say something about energy security."
"In line with the conclusions from June 2009, the European Council will next week assess what has been achieved with regard to energy infrastructure (interconnections) and crisis mechanisms."
"We have prepared a report on the progress made since January."
"The European Council will take note of the report."
"The European Council will also adopt the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region."
"We had a very rewarding debate on this during Parliament's plenary sitting in September."
"The Heads of State or Government will approve the Presidency's conclusions, which are to be adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday."
"This strategy forms an integrated framework for dealing with the challenges we face and contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion within the EU."
"I am convinced that this strategy can serve as inspiration for other macro-regions within the EU and, in so doing, strengthen European integration."
"The EU strategy for the Danube region is already taking shape and will be ready to be presented in time for the Hungarian Presidency in 2011."
"It is with great satisfaction that the Swedish Presidency can now present the result of this initiative, the inception of which, of course, took place here in the European Parliament."
"We hope that the European Council will be able to urge all of the relevant players to start implementing the strategy very quickly."
"That is absolutely necessary if we want to start tackling the serious environmental problems and achieve the objectives of the strategy."
"The European Council will also evaluate the progress made in implementing the conclusions relating to the migration situation in the Mediterranean."
"The Council will welcome the measures that have been taken in the short term - the launch of the pilot project in Malta, for example - as well as the progress made in setting up the European Asylum Support Office."
"It will also be noted that the EU and Turkey have resumed talks on migration."
"We expect the European Council to call for further efforts to deal with the current situation in the Mediterranean region and to continue the work towards long-term solutions based on solidarity between the Member States."
"We also expect the Council to emphasise the need for increased efforts to implement the EU's Global Approach to Migration."
"The Council will be urged to strengthen Frontex and to introduce common rules for Frontex operations at sea."
"Finally, there will also be a debate on external relations."
"In June, the institutions were asked by the General Affairs and External Relations Council to review how the EU can further engage in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"A first draft was discussed at the informal Gymnich meeting in September and the Member States are currently discussing a detailed proposal in the working groups."
"At the foreign ministers' meeting next week, the EU will adopt a plan to strengthen our engagement in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"The plan will focus on strengthening state capacity and the institutions in both countries."
"It is extremely important for it to be possible to implement this plan immediately."
"Extensive international measures are needed if we are to be able to turn developments around in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Military solutions alone can never lead to a sustainable solution."
"Without security and control, the economic progress will be lost."
"We also need to invest in establishing democratic institutions and strengthening civil society."
"The EU has an extremely important role to play in this regard in both countries."
"There are common problems as well as regional aspects and, of course, the approach varies between the two countries."
"We will be discussing this at the European Council next week and I will, of course, be available to listen to any comments and questions from the Members of this House."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I broadly agree with the lines expressed by Cecilia Malmström on behalf of the European Council."
"Let me highlight two main issues: the Lisbon Treaty and all institutional matters on the one hand, and the fight against climate change and the prospects for Copenhagen, on the other."
"First of all, I think this European Council should be able to take the final decisions to see the Treaty of Lisbon pass into force."
"For many years, we have known that the ratification of a new Treaty is not an easy business."
"We have had many setbacks and some disappointments, but every time the overriding case for the Treaty has won through - the compelling case for a democratic and effective Europe."
"I am confident that this will continue to be the case in jumping this final hurdle to seeing the Treaty enter into force after the strong support given to the Lisbon Treaty by the people of Ireland."
"After the conclusion of the ratification process in Poland, we can now say that all Member States have democratically approved the Lisbon Treaty."
"We only need to see the process of ratification completed in the Czech Republic."
"Of course, the constitutional procedures under way in the Czech Republic must be respected, so too must be the need to respond to the democratic will to see the Treaty enter into force."
"That democratic will was clearly shown by the Parliament of the Czech Republic, so I hope that no artificial obstacles and no artificial delays will now cause more difficulties before full ratification."
"I have already set out to this Parliament the importance of minimising delays in the nomination of the European Commission."
"However, we must do all we can to have a Lisbon Treaty Commission as these are critical times for Europe."
"We need to be able to push ahead with an agenda this Parliament supported when it elected me President for a new term."
"To achieve this and to have the institutions working properly, we do need ratification of the Lisbon Treaty if we want a strong, coherent and effective European Union."
"So, I again make it clear that the European Council must assume its responsibilities and there must be a recognition of urgency and a realisation that there will be a real cost to Europe as long as the European institutions cannot work properly."
"At the same time, it is right to push ahead now with the work on implementation and to be ready for the entry into force of the Treaty."
"I know that this Parliament is fully committed to this work."
"I am pleased to be cooperating with you to ensure that the benefits of the Treaty will come into play as quickly as possible."
"There are many areas in which this Parliament has already begun its work and has made a major contribution, crystallising ideas in areas like the European citizens' initiative."
"I know that this afternoon, you will be debating Elmar Brok's report on the European External Action Service."
"The report starts from exactly the right basis to ensure that the service, like the rest of the Treaty's innovations, makes our Community system even stronger and better performing."
"I know there have been concerns from the outset that the EAS will be some kind of intergovernmental body floating outside the European Union system, but the service should be firmly anchored in the European Union system."
"It should inevitably work very closely with all the institutions, the Commission first and foremost."
"The decisions it prepares will be taken by the Commission or by the Council in CFSP matters."
"In fact, I am convinced that its success will depend on this to ensure that the European Union's external action is more than the sum of its institutional parts."
"If it can work with the democratic underpinning of this Parliament, the Council's connection with national administrations and the Commission's expertise and European vision, that service can truly become a powerful tool for the European Union to achieve its goals on the global stage."
"A communautaire European external service, a service based on the Community method, will be a strong service for Europe and a strong tool for a united Europe projecting its influence in the world."
"At the same time, the European Council must take forward an active policy agenda."
"It must maintain the momentum of our work to address the economic crisis, mainly its impact on unemployment."
"We must carry forward the work we agreed at the G20."
"We must do everything we can to see that the proposals made by the European Commission on financial supervision enter into force as soon as possible."
"We must push on with our programme to address energy security."
"The most important issue in policy terms in the Council will be Copenhagen."
"A successful outcome at Copenhagen remains a primary concern for Europeans and a major task for the global community."
"There are less than 50 days to go to Copenhagen."
"Progress in the negotiations remains slow."
"It falls again to the European Union to show leadership and to keep up the momentum."
"The targets we have put on the table have provided an inspiration for others to step up their actions, but we all know that to galvanise real global action, we need to take a further step."
"We need to help developing countries with concrete ideas on finance, as the European Commission proposed last month."
"We estimate that by 2020, developing countries will need an additional EUR 100 billion or so a year."
"Domestic finance, namely from the large emerging economies - developing but emerging economies - and the carbon market should cover a large part of this, but large-scale international public finance should also be forthcoming, with the European Union paying its fair share."
"The Copenhagen agenda is not just about climate change."
"This is, of course, the main target, but the climate is also a question of a development, and we should not forget that very important dimension."
"This will be a major commitment, especially at a time when public budgets are already under pressure, but we all know that the longer we wait, the higher the costs will be."
"The task for the European Council is again to find creative solutions, to show that the European Union is united behind the need to fight climate change."
"First, Copenhagen must show that the drive to cut emissions is on its way; second, it must show that we are prepared to help those ready to take that step."
"This is the best way to make the case for the kind of active Europe that the Lisbon Treaty brings - driving ahead with an agenda that shows that the European Union brings concrete benefits for its citizens."
"To have an ambitious agenda, we need to have an effective institutional framework, and I come back to my first point."
"The Lisbon Treaty is the first Treaty of the enlarged Europe."
"This generation, particularly among our friends in central and eastern Europe, remembers well when Europe was divided, but we are not here for ever."
"Institutions will last, so we need to have institutions for the enlarged Europe."
"The Lisbon Treaty is the Treaty for the Europe of the 21st century, with strong institutions which are able to deliver concrete results in the Europe of 27 and more members in the future."
"Institutions alone, however, are not enough."
"We need a strong political will to achieve our goals, and I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will show that will for a strong ambitious outcome at Copenhagen."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) expects the next European Council to bring to an end the overly long period of uncertainty over the European institutions and to provide the necessary impetus to establish the new Commission and also the stable President of the Council and the High Representative planned in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Above all, the Council must take the required measures to boost the recovery of growth and to put Europe in the best position to create employment, since the crisis will endure for as long as social cohesion is not re-established."
"Firstly, on the institutions, I would like to remind everyone that the Polish President's decision to sign the Treaty means that every country but one has cleared the way for Europe finally to move forward without wasting time."
"On 27 October, two days before the European Council, the Czech constitutional court will study the compatibility of the Treaty with the country's constitution."
"Of course, we will respect that decision, whatever it may be."
"On the other hand, my group deplores the fact that the Czech President, although his parliament has as such adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, has produced a new pretext for delaying his signature, since everyone well knows that this is just a pretext."
"I find it regrettable that other countries are following in his footsteps and, in their turn, demanding assurances on this or that aspect of the Treaty."
"We must not surrender to the temptation to open this Pandora's box and I congratulate the Presidency for stating this clearly."
"The PPE group expects the European Council to indicate clearly that the European Union will not accept any delaying tactics."
"Everyone in Europe has, directly or indirectly, supported the Treaty and now we must move ahead."
"Each of us knows that, as long as European public debate is monopolised by the institutional issue and as long as Europe does not have the tools needed to make decisions both democratically and effectively, the real political, economic, social and ecological issues will not be addressed with the speed and seriousness required."
"We can well see that currently, we are in a stalemate."
"Parliament must be able to proceed with the hearings of future Commissioners as quickly as possible and it must be able to decide on the appointments for all the positions available at the Commission and the Council before the end of the year, if possible."
"The PPE group also expects from the European Council some clear guidance on economic policy, drawing conclusions from the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, which produced mixed results, and we are already seeing in the press that it is as if nothing happened."
"Europe must do everything it can to enable its businesses to return to a sufficient level of activity to recruit but also to invest in research."
"Europe must also do everything it can to create a fair commercial environment."
"Finally, on climate, I expect the European Council to produce a strategy suited to the situation, that is, the weakness of our partners' commitments so far, less than two months before Copenhagen."
"I ask this clear question: what pressure are we going to put on the United States, China and all the emerging countries?"
"Moderate and polite pressure or maximum pressure?"
"As much as I congratulate myself that Europe is a pioneer on this issue, it cannot be the only party to make the efforts required to combat global warming."
"There are only 50 days before the Copenhagen Summit - 50 days is not much, but it is enough if we know how to be convincing, and therefore I ask you, Mr President of the Council and Mr President of the Commission, to tell us how you intend to use these 50 days."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the October session of the European Council will be a key moment and it will show whether or not Europe is aware of the urgent need to act on the economy, on social questions and to overcome institutional quarrels."
"My group, the PPE, appeals to the sense of responsibility of each of the EU's 27 Member States."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, before I look at the institutional issues, I would like to make a brief remark about Copenhagen."
"You are completely right, Mrs Malmström, and Mr Barroso has reinforced this, that one of the essential decisions which we now have to make concerns Copenhagen."
"We need binding objectives, not general statements."
"This will not be easy to achieve, because the Americans have not yet completed their legislative process."
"We will also have to take some decisions after Copenhagen during the course of next year."
"However, there must be binding objectives in place at the end of the process."
"That is absolutely essential."
"Secondly, as far as the financial markets and the economic situation are concerned, the bonuses which are currently being paid are both outrageous and provocative."
"This applies particularly to America, but it will also be the case in Europe."
"This is not the central problem, but it demonstrates how many managers still do not understand what the new regulation of the financial markets involves and what responsibilities they have to the population as a whole."
"Mrs Malmström, I admit that you are right that the question of employment policy in particular must be given priority."
"It is not just about retaining the stimuli which were put in place as part of the economic recovery plan."
"It is also about introducing new measures to stimulate employment."
"Yesterday, the President of the Commission gave a positive response to Stephen Hughes's request."
"I am very pleased that we have at least been able to reach a consensus that employment policy must lie at the heart of our activities over the next few years."
"Now I would like to say something about Lisbon."
"Firstly, with regard to the lack of a signature from Václav Klaus, I am assuming that the constitutional court will make a positive judgment."
"I find it unacceptable that the Beneš Decrees are being used in this way, that this issue may perhaps be reopened and that the signature may be delayed."
"I would like to remind my fellow members from the Czech Republic that before their accession, we commissioned a report on the Beneš Decrees - Mrs Malmström, you will remember, because at that time you were one of us - which investigated whether the Beneš Decrees presented an obstacle to the accession of the Czech Republic."
"The majority opinion at the time was that they did not."
"The decrees do not have a different impact now, but they did have an impact at the time that they were drawn up."
"When we say that the Beneš Decrees were not an obstacle to the accession of the Czech Republic, this means that it is unacceptable now to use the same decrees in order to refuse to sign the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must make our opinions quite clear in this regard."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has two main objectives: on the one hand, more democracy in Europe, which includes more parliamentary democracy, in particular in the European Parliament"
"(Protests)"
"you do not want that because you are not in favour of more democracy - and, on the other hand, more efficiency."
"Mrs Malmström, it is now a very important task for you to ensure in the next few weeks that the institutional issues and the staffing issues do not stand in the way of this."
"Yesterday, Mr Barroso rightly said that we need a Council President over whom we have no influence, but who can work well with the Commission - and I would add here with the Parliament - and who believes that the community method lies at the heart of the decision-making process."
"That is very important."
"We do not need a Council President who shows off, dazzles everyone and tries to pull the wool over our eyes."
"We need a Council President who can work with us effectively."
"Of course, we need an External Action Service, not only for the reasons mentioned by the President of the Commission and to provide effective regulations concerning unity and a common foreign policy, but also for reasons of parliamentary control."
"It is not acceptable for items suddenly to be removed from the Treaty of Lisbon, which is intended to give more parliamentary control, with the result that we ultimately have less parliamentary control, if the External Action Service is to be completely independent."
"I know that we must find a compromise."
"However, you must be aware that we - together with Mr Brok, the rapporteur - fully agree with the President of the Commission that we need a clear structure."
"The decisive factor for us is once again parliamentary control, including control over the External Action Service and the foreign policy drawn up by the High Representative, although, of course, we acknowledge the role of the Council."
"As you were once one of us and have fought for this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we see you as a fellow combatant in this area."
"I hope that we can implement the Treaty of Lisbon in the way in which it was intended in order to bring about more democracy, more parliamentary control and more efficient foreign policy."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) Mr Swoboda, you mentioned that the Czech Republic was reassured at the time of its accession that there was no need for concern about the Beneš Decrees as they were not valid."
"Are you aware that the serious consequences of these decrees are still valid?"
"Therefore, if we have rule of law here, and we regard the whole of Europe to be governed by such, in this respect, the Czech Republic still has outstanding business with both the Sudeten Germans and Hungarians."
"Mr Swoboda, could you comment on that?"
"Mr President, I have become heavily involved in this issue, because many Sudeten Germans live in Austria and I recognise their rights, hardships and worries."
"However, we must finally lay the ghosts of the past and look to the future."
"The future is not about the Beneš Decrees."
"It is about a free Europe with free citizens whose rights are based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That is my vision of Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, 'the train has already travelled so fast and so far that I guess it will not be possible to stop it or turn it'."
"That is a quote from President Klaus and it is probably the only time that I agree with him, that the train has already travelled so fast and so far that it is not possible to stop it or turn it."
"This is a major quote from President Klaus, because apparently, it seems that he has accepted the fact that nothing can delay the Lisbon Treaty any longer."
"I think it is normal that if 27 Member States have ratified it, and have approved it, we can also now have his signature."
"I think that this change in his attitude can only be explained by our and your determination to go forward with the whole process as foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty, and we have to continue doing that in the coming days and weeks."
"I hope days, not weeks."
"In other words, the best way, in my opinion, to secure President Klaus's signature and the final ratification of the Treaty is simply, Mrs Malmström, to go forward with the whole process and with implementation."
"He is saying that the train has travelled so fast that it is impossible to stop it, so you have to continue with the train."
"In that respect, it is absolutely necessary that the Council speeds up the procedure for the nomination of the new Commission, and puts forward as fast as possible the package for the President of the Council and the High Representative."
"I repeat that this is the best way to show President Klaus that he is right, that the train is running faster and faster every day, and that there is no other option for him than to put his signature under the Treaty."
"If you wait, he will wait."
"If you go forward, he will sign."
"That is my opinion."
"My second point is about the External Action Service."
"I hope that the Council can reach agreement on that, but not any agreement."
"We should avoid duplication."
"My fear is that we are creating two parallel structures at the moment: one is the Commission and Union delegations, as in the new Treaty, which today amounts to more than 6 000 people, local staff included, working for the Commission and the President of the Commission."
"The other is a new External Action Service with several thousand people working for the High Representative."
"At the end of this whole process, it is absolutely clear and necessary that we have only one structure dealing with external affairs and not this parallel structure of Commission delegations on the one hand, and external action services on the other."
"I hope that we have an agreement in the Council, but I also hope that it will be an agreement in which it is very clear that there can be no duplication in the Commission structures, with Commission delegations on the one side and the External Action Service on the other."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, on the subject of the Czech Republic, I would first of all like to say that I feel that Mr Klaus is a very bad loser and that his actions represent a particular kind of political impertinence."
"I would like to ask you very, very urgently not to respond to a bad loser who obviously does not even respect Czech law, because he does not respect the constitutional majority which voted in favour of the treaty in the Czech Republic and who disregards the legislation in the Czech Republic, when he demands an opt-out for the Czech Republic concerning the validity of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In my opinion, that would be one step too far in relation to this Czech troublemaker."
"The citizens of the Czech Republic, who have done so much for the reunification of Europe when the Germans fled there, deserve something better."
"That is all I have to say on President Klaus."
"(Applause)"
"On the subject of climate change, Mr Barroso, you have rarely heard me agree with you as much as I will today."
"I am very, very enthusiastic about the fact that you have once again said here how important it is for the Europeans to make a clear commitment to contributing a specific sum to the international fund for climate protection measures for the developing countries."
"Yesterday, I was ashamed to read that the German state secretary for finance, who was taking part in negotiations in Luxembourg, compared the negotiations to a game of poker."
"He said that when you play poker, you do not tell anyone what you have in your hand."
"However, the preparations for Copenhagen are certainly not a game of poker."
"As Mrs Merkel and other leading politicians in the European Union have repeatedly said, this is the biggest challenge of all."
"This is the most important challenge for the community of people who live together on this planet."
"I believe that this must be taken seriously."
"From 2020 onwards, EUR 100 billion should be available to help the developing countries to meet the obligations concerning climate protection that they must then take on and to carry out their adaptation measures."
"This would amount to around EUR 3 billion from 2020 onwards for a country like Germany."
"In comparison to what we are currently making available in economic recovery packages or to rescue the financial sector, this is peanuts."
"I am ashamed that failure in Copenhagen and this dreadful, embarrassing poker game are being accepted."
"The way in which the European Union negotiated yesterday in Luxembourg demonstrates that it is not the driving force."
"It has not taken on the leadership role in international climate protection."
"Instead, it is one of the major blocks to progress."
"You must realise that all of the negotiations today in Luxembourg and next week in Brussels are being followed throughout the world."
"I can only call on Mr Barroso urgently once again to ensure that the Commission stays on course."
"The financing for this international fund must be transparent."
"We have been talking about this for two years, ever since Bali."
"Mrs Malmström, I believe that the Swedes are doing the correct thing in the negotiations."
"You must remain consistent and respect the vote in Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The objective is to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020."
"If we lower our sights, we will never achieve the two degree goal."
"I have a major problem with the credibility of the Swedish Presidency of the Council."
"I believe that you should finally convince your state-owned company Vattenfall not to invest consistently and unrestrictedly in coal throughout Europe and, in particular, not to invest primarily where no certificates need to be purchased."
"This strategy on the part of Vattenfall goes against your good reputation in the preparations for the world climate negotiations."
"I would also ask you to ensure that the legal proceedings initiated by Vattenfall against the Federal Republic of Germany to bring about changes in Germany's environmental law in favour of Vattenfall's coal-fired power stations are dropped."
"I believe that unfortunately you have a small, but growing black spot on your otherwise spotless reputation."
"You should ensure that everything is in order before you go to Copenhagen."
"Colleagues, please keep to the allotted time."
"Your speeches are very important but nevertheless, I have another request for a blue-card question."
"I am not going to take every blue card because we must go ahead with our discussion."
"In a few minutes, there will be another request; if it is a Rule 149(8) request, I will take it."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, may I first of all congratulate the Swedish Government on its Presidency in general and particularly on the way it has attempted to advance the very important issues of climate change and dealing with the economic and financial crisis that faces us."
"I think Mr Reinfeldt and his government deserve our thanks for the way they have done this but, as has been the situation in many Presidencies, they have also had to accommodate a lot of internal institutional distractions - in this case, in relation to the Lisbon Treaty."
"Institutional theology is not the priority of the citizens of Europe."
"What we need, of course, is the Lisbon Agenda, not the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Lisbon Agenda has a noble objective: an objective of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs, greater social cohesion and respect for the environment by 2010."
"Now that should have made a real difference in the lives of millions of people and provided a firm foundation for our economic future and yet, as Mr Reinfeldt himself said, the Lisbon Agenda has been a failure."
"Why can we never actually get results that matter to our citizens?"
"The laudable aims in the Laeken Declaration were not then put into practice, and now the Lisbon Agenda faces the same lack of purpose and achievement."
"So near, Mr President, but so far, and again initiatives relating to the economies of Member States must be clearly understandable to ordinary people."
"Job creation should not be about creating jobs for former Prime Ministers to be President of the Council, or for globetrotting aficionados to be High Representatives for Foreign Affairs."
"Those two jobs will hardly help hard-pressed small and medium-sized businesses in any of our countries."
"They will not ease the crisis being borne by millions of families right now."
"And institutional changes do not help with climate changes."
"The greatest threats to our world need confronting, and practical and workable solutions need to be found."
"Thousands of pages of text, most of it too complicated for our citizens ever to understand, simply consumes the trees that we need to protect."
"Let us put pressure on the world community to come together to save the planet for future generations, not on those who do not fully share the enthusiasm of some people for the European institutions."
"Despite all this, I do hope that the Swedish Presidency is able, in the time remaining to it, and indeed at the summit, to focus the attention of all European leaders on the major issues that concern the people - those issues they concentrated upon at the start of their Presidency regarding the economy, Europe and indeed climate change."
"I wish them well in the remaining time and thank them for their work so far."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, there has been much speculation over staffing issues during the last three months and over the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which my group has rejected for three good reasons."
"In simplistic terms, firstly we want priority to be given to a social Europe rather than to a radical market orientation."
"Secondly, we want disarmament instead of the development of military capabilities and, thirdly, we want more direct democracy rather than a Europe made up of elites."
"We should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content."
"While we are arguing over names and positions, more and more people are losing their jobs."
"The banks have, of course, been rescued."
"At the same time, Mr Barroso is calling for us to bring an end to the economic recovery plans soon - yesterday the deadline was set for 2011 - and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be reduced quickly."
"This will mean reductions in salaries and pensions, cuts in public services and social security provision, higher value added tax and a lack of collective agreements."
"One current example of this can be found in the German commercial cleaning industry where workers have been on strike for three days."
"These are the problems which are affecting people in Europe and these are the problems which the Council should be dealing with."
"Instead of this, the main subject of concern is adding clauses to the Treaty of Lisbon to encourage the Czech President to sign it."
"If this is really as simple as it seems to be in practice, I would ask the Heads of Government to think more carefully about a social progress clause in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That would be much more appropriate."
"At the beginning of the parliamentary term, a series of positive proposals were made concerning a more social EU policy."
"This did not just relate to the social progress clause."
"It was also about a new economic recovery plan for Europe in order to create and retain jobs and about increased investment and sustainable environmental growth."
"A European Employment Pact for more and better jobs, for equal pay, for more rights for employees and better working conditions was called for."
"There were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems."
"I have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the Member States or the policies of the Commission which might lead us towards these objectives."
"Of course, the Council must now consider the appointments to the new Commission and the possible changes to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, the focus must be on the problems I have referred to and on their solutions."
"My group's vote on the College of Commissioners will be dependent on this."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, Mr Barroso said this morning that all Member States had democratically ratified this Treaty."
"That is not true."
"The British people have not had a say on this, despite being promised it, and until we get a referendum on this, I will refuse to recognise the legitimacy of this Treaty."
"(Protests)"
"Now all eyes are on President Klaus and what he may or may not do next week, and it is interesting."
"I know that you all hate President Klaus because he believes in national democracy."
"(Protests)"
"But what he is doing here is that he is standing up and defending the Czech national interest."
"He fears German claims over Sudeten properties and, having listened to German politicians on this subject, I think he is absolutely right to be fearful."
"So, hang on, President Klaus; if they do not give you what you want, do not sign the thing."
"If they do give you what you want, it will need to be reratified in 25 Member States, which will mean that the British will have a referendum, and I am sure, as democrats, you would all like to see a British referendum on this Treaty."
"I certainly would."
"And I wonder, at the end of this summit, are we really going to have a new European emperor?"
"Is it going to be Tony Blair with his Empress Cherie?"
"Well I have reached the conclusion that I want Tony Blair."
"Please do appoint Tony Blair, the man that gave away GBP 2 billion of the British rebate in return for nothing; the man who promised us a referendum on the constitution and refused to give it to us."
"It is perfectly clear that, in this European Union, the prize for national betrayal is a high one indeed."
"So please appoint Tony Blair."
"It will bring home the truth to the British people that it is not the elected representatives that matter in this European Union, it is people that give away national democracy in favour of the European Union that win the top jobs."
"Please, please, give us Tony Blair as the first President of Europe."
"Mr President, it is disappointing - but not unexpected - that the Council and the Commission are determined to push ahead with the Lisbon Treaty."
"I know that it might not be popular in this House, but it is my genuinely-held belief that in the United Kingdom, there should be a referendum on the Treaty."
"I do not understand why both Conservatives and Labour are unwilling to give that."
"However, this morning I want to direct your attention, Minister, in particular, to the financial crisis that continues to dog Europe."
"Last night, Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, indicated that UK lending to the banks was close to GBP 1 trillion."
"Indeed, he indicated that never before had so much money been owed by so few to so many people and with so little real reform."
"Mr King went further to indicate that regulation of the banks was not enough, but that there was a moral dilemma at the heart of this banking crisis in that financial and banking institutions knew that they were too big to fail and that the taxpayer, whether in the United Kingdom or in any of the other regions of Europe, would always have to help them out, no matter what the crisis."
"This is a very serious charge, Minister, and comes from one of the banking world's own leading members."
"There must be a will to tackle this moral dilemma at Council meetings, and this House would be interested to know what that will is and how it will be done."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a few comments now, even though I will, of course, remain here until the end of the debate."
"I would first like to address Mr Verhofstadt."
"No, I do not think that it will be possible to stop the train either."
"I hope that the train will enter the station very, very soon."
"I can assure both Mr Verhofstadt and the honourable Members that the Swedish Presidency is in very close contact with the Czech Republic and we hope very soon to be able to give a more exact and definite answer to the question of what is to happen with the Treaty and when."
"Like you, we are keen for everything to fall into place as quickly as possible, with regard to both the posts that are to be filled and the list of commissioners that is to be presented to the European Parliament for the hearing that you are to hold."
"During the summit, we will take all the necessary decisions that it is possible to take."
"We will have all the preparations in place for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force as soon as we have all the ratifications."
"I would also like to express my thanks for the huge amount of support that Members from all groups have shown for the Presidency's absolute top priority, namely to reach an agreement in Copenhagen."
"This is extremely important."
"There is a huge amount of responsibility resting on Europe's shoulders to settle the issue of financing so that we can show that we are taking our share of the global responsibility and can send out the appropriate signals."
"Mr Daul, we have very intensive contact with other players."
"In only a few weeks' time, we have the summit with Russia and China, as well as the US, and climate and energy issues will, of course, be given priority in discussions with all of these countries."
"We also have the working group meetings and the Barcelona Summit in ten days' time."
"In addition, the finance ministers will meet in St Andrews, so there are many opportunities to talk about this."
"I am not satisfied with the results so far, but I remain totally optimistic that we will still be able to reach an agreement in Copenhagen."
"People all over the world are expecting us to do so."
"I also believe that it will be a very good thing if the EU can show results with regard to the handling of the financial crisis."
"Even though we are now seeing some positive signs, we still must not forget that we need to have the new supervisory bodies in place so that we can be better equipped to avoid similar crises happening in future and to be able to recognise them in time."
"I therefore hope that monitoring systems and the macro-supervisory body can be established as soon as possible."
"Institutional issues are extremely important."
"It is important for the European Union to be able to take decisions and for this to be done democratically and in an effective manner."
"In this regard, the Treaty of Lisbon is an important instrument."
"At the same time, the European Union will never win the trust of its citizens if we do not deliver results on specific issues."
"The handling of the economic crisis and environmental issues are what people the world over, not least in the European Union, are concerned about."
"If we can move forward and achieve results at the summit and later in the autumn, then I believe that it will create a very good basis for increased legitimacy and trust in the European institutions."
"Mr President, I think that the Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Joseph Daul, and Mrs Harms have asked some very important questions."
"How can we ensure success at Copenhagen, especially when other partners are not making the same effort?"
"In fact, there are difficulties, because there is a clear lack of ambition on the part of some developed countries in terms of a concrete commitment to reduce emissions."
"The largest economies in the developing countries are also unwilling to integrate their national plans for mitigation with the global agreement and, at the moment, there is no credible financial plan."
"So, what do we do in this case?"
"Firstly, I believe this is not the time for Europe to rein in its ambition."
"That would provide an excuse for the negative elements not to make any effort."
"Consequently, it is our job to continue to demonstrate ambition and leadership but, at the same time, and here I am replying in concrete terms to Joseph Daul, to say that our offer, especially our financial offer, is a conditional one."
"We are prepared to help those countries which are making genuine efforts to reduce emissions."
"It is therefore important to make a conditional offer in financial terms, but to rein in our ambition would be a mistake."
"I believe success is still possible in Copenhagen."
"There are also positive aspects."
"The United States has re-entered the negotiations."
"It should be recalled that a few years ago, the United States was not really participating in the process but they are now committed to the negotiations."
"It should also be recalled that Australia and Japan have announced ambitious goals - not yet in binding terms, certainly, but at a political level."
"Even China, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea have announced ambitious national plans but have not yet agreed to integrate them into a global agreement."
"Let us, therefore, emphasise these positive aspects and create this dynamic and I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will not supply the sceptics and the Cassandras, who are already saying that we need a plan B, with ammunition. I have already said that there is no plan B, because there is no planet B. What we need to do is concentrate and not miss this historic opportunity afforded by Copenhagen."
"My final point is to express my surprise."
"I would never have expected a British Member of this Parliament to question that great institution that is the British Parliament."
"One of the greatest contributions of Britain to civilisation was, and is, the British Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Let us be clear."
"The British Government has negotiated the Treaty."
"The British Government has signed the Treaty."
"The Parliament of Britain - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - have approved the Treaty."
"Her Majesty the Queen has ratified the Treaty."
"The instruments of ratification of the UK are deposited in Rome."
"So the United Kingdom has ratified the Lisbon Treaty and I hope that everybody - particularly the British Members - respects the British democratic system."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Farage is now leaving."
"I hope that there is no one in this Chamber who hates what he has implied about us."
"Hate goes against the European ethos, and egoism, protectionism and nationalism are the greatest enemies of the Community of the European Union."
"Secondly, I hope that there is no one in this Chamber who is playing off parliamentary democracy against the citizens and who sees a dividing line between us and our job as representatives of the citizens, as he has implied."
"We have all seen the sparks flying in the run-up to the summit and we are hoping for a decisive, liberating judgment from the constitutional court."
"We expect the Council to fulfil its responsibility to Europe, not to allow itself to be held hostage by one person and to take the necessary decisions concerning staffing, the institutions, the schedule, the content and the finances."
"However, I also call on the governments not to look for the lowest common denominator when selecting and nominating the commissioners, but instead to find the best solution for the Community of which we are all a part."
"I call on the governments not to play the familiar old party political games when selecting the commissioners, but instead to put common European responsibility at the heart of the selection process."
"I call on the President of the Commission to produce an ambitious set of requirements for the commissioners and the Member States."
"My second point concerns supervision of the financial markets."
"I welcome the proposals for macro-supervision, but they do not go nearly far enough."
"We also need micro-supervision and, in my opinion, the Commission proposal represents the lowest common denominator, the minimum."
"We must go further."
"We must put in place a supervisory body for the European financial markets which has the authority to take the necessary measures, similar to the European Central Bank."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, the demand from Václav Klaus for an addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is both arbitrary and superfluous."
"However, it is easy to oppose, because the charter refers only to EU law and applies only to the future."
"Therefore, if necessary, the Council should make a political declaration."
"In a few weeks, the ratification of the treaty, which we have been waiting nine years for, should then take place."
"The European Council must make the necessary preparations, but should not jump to any hasty conclusions."
"This applies also to the European External Action Service."
"The High Representative is responsible for proposing a concept for the service, not the Council bureaucracy."
"I would therefore ask the Council Presidency to ensure that the service is not in a position off to one side, but can integrate itself into the community system, as Mr Barroso has said."
"This treaty gives us the legal basis for a common energy policy and for a common climate protection policy."
"I can only hope that the fog lifts before Copenhagen, because we must not leave these questions open until the conference."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear demands, including with regard to financing."
"I hope that there will be agreement on a financing concept next week at the summit."
"Furthermore, we need internal burden-sharing within the EU."
"Germany and other countries must give way, as we need a fair deal both within the EU and between the EU and the developing countries throughout the world."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask three questions."
"Firstly, there is the issue of climate change."
"Everyone can see that the European Union has a special duty to lead the nations of the world in Copenhagen."
"To do this, we must be demanding and ambitious as far as goals are concerned, but we must also acknowledge the debt we have to developing countries."
"Each country must agree to make an appropriate financial effort."
"If we cannot demonstrate solidarity, this will not work."
"My second point concerns the issue of migration."
"It is obviously good to improve the operations of Frontex, but if we really want to help the countries of southern Europe, then we must move towards harmonising the right to asylum, review the Dublin Convention and, most of all, finally draw up a genuine immigration policy."
"I believe this is the only way of addressing this issue in a calm and responsible way."
"Finally, the third issue is foreign policy."
"The Council is going to take the issue of the External Action Service forward."
"So much the better!"
"We are probably going to have a High Representative."
"So much the better!"
"Yet what would be better still would be to speak with a single voice, at least on the conflicts shaking the world."
"I am thinking particularly about Afghanistan, where I want to note that the number of European soldiers committed is almost the same as the number of US soldiers."
"There will be an EU-US Summit on 3 November and the Europeans have a special responsibility."
"They must propose a strategy that is not exclusively military."
"If we do not do this, no one else will."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is on the home straight and it is now time to look to the future."
"We must make Europe more social, more environmentally friendly and more democratic."
"We have a lot of catching up to do in these areas in particular."
"I would like to see a Europe in which the citizens regard themselves not just as observers or as the object of the European Community, but as its subject."
"I would like to see a Europe which people feel is a Europe for citizens, but we have a lot to do in order to achieve that."
"I said that the Treaty of Lisbon was on the home straight, but it is here in particular that it can easily be thrown off course."
"I am frustrated by the fact that shortly before the completion of the ratification process, we are seeing an increasing number of blatant violations of the European ethos and of European law."
"One individual European president is attempting to hold his people, his country and the whole of Europe to ransom."
"Now he suddenly explains that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not apply in his country."
"If what I found out yesterday is true, then he has even been given assurances of this kind."
"This would really be outrageous and I would be pleased if the situation could be clarified and a clear explanation given that assurances of this kind have not been made."
"Otherwise, it seems that we are returning to the Middle Ages, with despotic rulers granting their subjects only those rights that they are prepared to allow."
"However, we are not in the Middle Ages, we are in Europe and Europe is a community based on law, a democracy."
"The Czech parliament and senate have already voted in favour of this treaty, without making demands of this kind."
"They have, of course, done this for good reason, because they want the Charter of Fundamental Rights to apply in the Czech Republic."
"It lies at the heart of this treaty and we should not allow the heart to be torn out of the treaty without good cause."
"The fundamental rights are the inalienable rights of all citizens, which should not be available only to some of them."
"Europe is a community based on law, a democracy."
"It is not a bazaar."
"This means that we should prevent dreadful deals of this kind being done with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we should not, under any circumstances, allow it to be qualified or called into question."
"We should not permit things of this kind to become negotiable and Europe to be turned into a bazaar."
"These events are a demonstration of how important it is for us to strengthen democracy in Europe."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond to the previous speech."
"It is absolutely clear that the next meeting of the European Council will be dominated by institutional questions and the process for ratifying the Lisbon Treaty."
"In the debates on the future direction of the EU, we should, in my opinion, behave towards each other with an appropriate sense of humility and, at the same time, we should calmly respect the sovereign decision-making mechanisms of the various Member States and their constitutional actors."
"I would now like to return to my own topic."
"I personally consider macro-regional strategy to be no less an important item on the Council's discussion agenda."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was already agreed during the last parliament that the Baltic Sea region was suitable for a pilot project aimed at implementing an internal EU strategy for the macro-region and I am therefore pleased that this particular Council decision will most probably be ratified."
"At the same time, I believe that the time has now come to begin starting thinking about the issue of how to replicate this pilot strategy."
"If we take a look at the map of Europe in this context, we will see that the greatest differences, whether economic, social or cultural, still persist along the borders between the former socialist bloc and the West European capitalist states."
"These differences are apparent here in Parliament as well."
"Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we are still talking about the old and the new Member States."
"Twenty years after the Velvet Revolution, we are still applying exceptions to the free movement of persons when we make use of transition periods for the free movement of workers."
"These are absolutely clear barriers which should be systematically dismantled ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, the statements by the Council and the Commission on the forthcoming European Council summit signal an escalation in the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and of the governments of its Member States, with a new all-out attack on the working classes."
"The primary objective of the European Union and the governments of its Member States, be they centre right or centre left, is to safeguard the continuing profitability of the monopolies by shifting the burden of the capitalist economic crisis on to the working classes throughout the European Union."
"While the European Union has supported the monopoly behemoths with a package of hundreds of billions of euros, and a new round of funding for them cannot be excluded, in this new phase, the faster promotion of capitalist restructurings planned within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy is being favoured."
"At the epicentre of the anti-labour attack is the abolition of the eight-hour day and collective agreements, and the generalised application of flexicurity and temporary flexible and badly-paid jobs, by strengthening the institution of local employment agreements and internships."
"Social security, health, welfare and education systems are being laid on a Procrustean bed, with sweeping changes being made to the detriment of workers, further paving the way for the penetration of monopoly business groups in these wealth-producing sectors for capitalism."
"At the same time, mass redundancies, over five and a half million last year, employer terrorism and intensification of work have created mediaeval conditions in the workplace."
"One typical example is the long-standing crime being committed against the workers of France Telecom, where 25 workers have been pushed into suicide by unacceptable working conditions and the intensification of slavery."
"Mr President, the big problem for the Member States is, as Mr Bisky said earlier, the crisis in jobs."
"Youth unemployment is 24% in France, 25% in Italy and 39% in Spain."
"Nevertheless, we can be sure that the European Council meeting will be saturated with a colossal triumphalism in the context of mass unemployment."
"This triumphalism is improper and distasteful, and it will be there because the elite assume that they have got their Lisbon Treaty."
"All the moves so far towards your European superstate have taken place by stealth or manipulation and, in the case of the Lisbon Treaty, the manipulation has been so shameless and so blatant that the Treaty lacks democratic legitimacy."
"From that, there will be consequences."
"To quote, 'They are ringing the bells now; very soon they will be wringing their hands.'"
"(HU) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, any debate about the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon is superfluous until we have clarified with each other what our most fundamental values are."
"Allow me to give you a few examples relating to the largest disenfranchised minority in Europe, which is the Hungarian community living outside the Carpathian Basin."
"Are you aware, for example, that territorial self-determination for the two-million-strong Hungarian community in one of the European Union Member States is still not on the agenda even to this day, although we all know that territorial autonomy is a European legal institution?"
"Are you aware that in the same country, Romania, several tens of thousands of Csango Hungarians cannot, even to this day, worship and be taught in their mother tongue?"
"We then have a state which is younger than me, Slovakia, with its Slovak language law, which we can rightly say brings shame on Europe."
"To top it all, there are despicable politicians who are using the inhumane Beneš Decrees as a basis for negotiation."
"What kind of dictatorial, racist Europe do we live in then, where the Beneš Decrees can be regarded as a basis for negotiation?"
"We have had enough of having dictatorships being forced on us, always under the guise of democracy."
"We Jobbik MEPs would like to live in a Europe without the Beneš Decrees, without a Slovak language law and without a Treaty of Lisbon, where there is not a single Hungarian persecuted on account of their ethnic origin and mother tongue."
"I would like to ask Mr Swoboda then: if he said that the Beneš Decrees are not valid, when were the victims compensated?"
"(RO) There are certain speakers in this Parliament who, regardless of the topic being discussed, talk on the same subject, not always in an appropriate manner."
"The first priority during the European Council meeting must obviously be to find a solution so that the Czech Republic can finalise the procedures for ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, this solution must be a fair one for all the other Member States."
"At the same time, we must not forget the current economic crisis which we are still facing and which we must also find immediate solutions for."
"The economic and financial crisis, along with the special financial measures adopted last year, have destabilised in an alarming way the public finances of the majority of the European Union's Member States."
"So far the Commission has 17 of the 27 Member States in its sights for having an excessive deficit, with estimates showing that another three Member States will soon be in the same situation."
"Regardless of their economic power, Member States have exceeded the figures committed to as the crisis has caused a sharp drop in budget revenue and growth beyond the public expenditure planned for."
"There are actually clear conditions for an economic recovery in the near future, which is why we can initiate the discussions on reducing the financial incentives in certain areas."
"However, we need to take into account the specific situation of each Member State separately and the European institutions must acknowledge that we are not yet at the point where public support can be waived completely for all economic sectors."
"Member States must agree on continuing the recovery strategy and on suitable instruments for supporting this, including stepping up structural reforms which may, in the medium term, reduce the fiscal deficit and naturally contribute to economic recovery."
"If the post-recovery period is not managed properly by Member States, it may destabilise the European Union's internal market."
"Therefore, the decision in favour and permission to continue providing public support must be made based on the specific conditions from one state to the next."
"(FI) Mr President, I agree with Mr Marinescu that the forthcoming Council should find a solution to two issues."
"One is completing the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the other is new cures for the economic and financial crisis."
"We are presently living through the deepest crisis in Europe's economic history."
"This crisis will mean a thorough shake-up of people's opportunities, income, pensions and jobs, and we must be aware of that."
"The European Union began its recovery very well."
"We should thank the Commission for that."
"The Commission and the European Central Bank even acted so quickly that the United States of America followed Europe's example."
"Then things rather oddly began to slow down and people started to say that the crisis was over."
"The crisis, however, in fact lies ahead, because a four-bladed guillotine hangs over the European Union, in the shape of growing unemployment, indebted national economies, an ageing population, and the huge structural change which will take place in the forestry industry, the car industry, and so on."
"Actually, the only good thing about this economic crisis is that policy is required to resolve the problems."
"As for the new financial architecture, the Commission is being quite unambitious about this."
"Hopefully, the financial crisis work group that Parliament has set up will be a new source of guidance."
"The objective must be the regulation of the financial markets."
"Over-regulation, however, must not be allowed to prevent growth and employment."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, Mrs Wallström, I am guessing, Mrs Malmström, that you have so many subjects to discuss that you would rather have two weeks than two days for the summit next week."
"These are subjects which are of genuine importance to the citizens of Europe, such as the economic crisis and how it can be overcome, highlighting opportunities to create new jobs and, of course, Afghanistan."
"These are not new subjects."
"However, what is new is that this time, it is possible to discuss everything from the perspective that the EU will really be able to function more effectively and that we will have a new treaty."
"This is an exciting prospect and, therefore, you should now act quickly to implement a common supervisory structure for the European financial markets, to put in place a common foreign policy and to prepare for the summit in Copenhagen."
"You should also clarify quickly what the future leadership structure of the EU will be and bring an end to this self-absorption."
"What we need is less navel-gazing and more reports of success from the European Union."
"For this reason, I wish you success, luck and all the authority you need."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that I am unable to make my speech in Catalan since it is not yet an official language, even though it is the language of more than 10 million European citizens."
"For that reason, I am speaking today in Italian."
"The Finnish Government recently recognised the right of all citizens to have a broadband Internet connection as a universal service."
"This service is, in fact, an element of economic development, social justice and territorial balance, because it guarantees access to information, thus preventing the digital divide."
"In the same way, affordable broadband access is crucial when it comes to building the knowledge-based economy laid down in the Lisbon objectives."
"Will the next European Council adopt measures to ensure that the European Union as a whole sets the world an example in this area too?"
"Mr President, there will be many important issues discussed at the European Council, but from my point of view, one of the most important is the future of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Many speakers in this debate have spoken, without any apparent irony at all, of the Lisbon Treaty bringing increased democracy and accountability to the EU institutions, forgetting that they deliberately took a view that there should be no democracy or accountability in the progress of that Treaty itself."
"There was active collusion between the Heads of Government to avoid any referenda taking place on the Treaty lest the people were inconvenient enough to actually say they did not want it."
"I listened with great interest to Mr Barroso's comments earlier."
"Let me explain to him why people in the UK are so angry about this."
"In the 2005 UK general election, all three main political parties committed themselves in their manifestos to a referendum on the European Constitution, as it then was."
"It subsequently became the Lisbon Treaty, effectively the same document."
"In the vote in the House of Commons, two of those parties then reneged on those promises and refused people a referendum, so it is a matter of basic trust and accountability in politics."
"People want the referendum that they were promised."
"If they had not been promised it, then Mr Barroso's comments would have been correct and there would have been the normal parliamentary ratification process in the UK."
"I supported Mr Barroso in his re-election, but we do not need lectures from him about trust and accountability in politics when, at the same time, he seeks to support those who would deny people a referendum."
"So that, in short, is why people in the UK feel so strongly about this referendum."
"They look over the water to Ireland and see that the people of Ireland have been asked to vote twice on the document when we have been denied the possibility to even vote once."
"You cannot, on the one hand, argue that it will bring increased democracy and accountability to the EU whilst, at the same time, denying the electorates of the EU any say whatsoever on this document."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to make a few points which, in view of the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, must be developed, and also, I would say, above all, in the light of the very significant effect of the German constitutional court's recent judgment on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I should like to concentrate in particular on the issue of the lack of democratic legitimacy as a result of two aspects: the inadequate representation in the European Parliament, and also in the various European institutions, of countries with the largest populations, and the lack of consideration shown for the national parliaments with regard to the exercising of sovereign powers at European Union level."
"I should like to mention another, in my view significant, shortcoming of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that the role of the regional parliaments is basically ignored."
"While little consideration is shown for the national parliaments, I would say that the principle of subsidiarity has been dealt a kind of death blow by the Treaty of Lisbon as it stands today."
"The judgment by the German constitutional court, precisely because of its authority and its strength, should have led, and should still lead, to a comprehensive legal and political debate in this House that specifically deals with the dangers, the risks that may arise as a result of the European Union federalisation process introduced by this treaty."
"I also wish to mention the rights of stateless nations, from Padania to Brittany, Corsica to Valle d'Aosta."
"There are dozens of stateless nations that should be mentioned, bearing in mind the fact that what the founding fathers wanted to build was a Europe of the nations, not a federalist Europe or a Europe of the biggest interests."
"(DE) Mr President, with regard to the subject of illegal immigration in the European Union, I would like to point out that there has been a significant and very serious increase over the last year."
"According to the Commission, the number of illegal immigrants recorded has risen by around 63%."
"In 2008, 62 000 sets of fingerprints of illegal immigrants who had been apprehended were entered in the EURODAK database."
"We cannot even guess at the number of immigrants who were not caught."
"The geographical situation of Austria, where I come from, makes it a particularly popular destination and this has had disastrous consequences."
"For example, 58 of the 64 Kurds who were apprehended recently disappeared into the reception centre and immediately submitted applications for asylum, which involves a long-winded procedure."
"The burden represented by the constantly growing number of illegal immigrants - I would like to emphasise the word 'illegal' here - is becoming unbearable for the citizens of the EU."
"If we do not solve this problem quickly, we should not be surprised by the growing scepticism about the EU and the sense of resignation among our citizens."
"I therefore ask the European Council to consider this subject on 29 and 30 November."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Wallström, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon must now enter into force and be implemented quickly."
"More than ten years of debates among the institutions are enough."
"Now, at last, we need these instruments in order to be able to help the citizens of Europe."
"Particularly during this economic crisis, we must do something for the citizens in the fight against unemployment and similar problems."
"For this reason, we should rapidly bring these debates to an end."
"This is why I am asking President Klaus to clear the way for the treaty which has been ratified in all 27 countries."
"In the Czech Republic, the constitutional court has said 'yes' to the treaty on two occasions and it will do so again for a third time."
"It is also perfectly clear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is only applicable in the context of European law."
"Land regulations are exclusively a matter of national authority."
"The law in force before Community law will not be invalidated by Community law."
"These three safeguards are in place, so he has no need to worry."
"If necessary, the European Council will have to clarify this once again by issuing a declaration."
"In this context, I would like to make another comment."
"The implementation of the treaty must reflect the three principles of the draft constitution and the Constitutional Convention: efficiency, transparency and democracy."
"At this point, I would like to mention the External Action Service in particular, as we will be debating this subject again this afternoon."
"Transparency, democracy and, in particular, the principle of community must not be sacrificed in order to achieve efficiency."
"The necessary safeguards must be put in place."
"We could say that part of the Commission has a sui generis character, but it is possible to discuss all sorts of issues here."
"For this reason, Mrs Malmström, I would like to ask you to drop your government's current plans and not to draw up guidelines for the External Action Service during the meeting of the European Council next week, which would limit the scope for negotiation, but instead to come to final decisions on this subject together with the new High Representative so that we have a common, fair basis for negotiation."
"Mr Brok, you mentioned 10 years of debates about the Lisbon Treaty."
"Has it occurred to you that, in the 10 years of debates, you and your colleagues have simply failed to convince enough people, and that is why you and your colleagues have had to resort to the blatant manipulation to which I referred earlier to get the Treaty through?"
"(DE) I would like to say to my fellow Member that the institutional changes resulting from the Treaty of Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon have always had the broad support of the people of Europe and the broad support of the majority of European states."
"There have always been individual states which have made different decisions, partly for internal political purposes."
"Now the decision has been made in the parliaments of 27 states - and parliaments are not a second-class form of democracy - or in referendums as in Ireland."
"As a result, a vast majority is now in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, including the majority of your own people."
"(CS) I would like to make a few comments ahead of the European Council meeting concerning the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in my own country, the Czech Republic."
"The Czechs have given a clear 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty through their elected representatives in both chambers of parliament."
"All of the public opinion polls indicate that they want President Klaus to sign the Treaty quickly."
"The Czechs also want to be guaranteed the same human, civil and social rights in Europe as other Europeans."
"It is for this reason that they also gave a clear 'yes' to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"President Klaus is known for his long-standing opposition to the Charter, and particularly its social sections."
"Now, under the pretext of the so-called Sudeten threat, he is attempting under pressure of time to negotiate an opt-out for the Czech Republic."
"The European Union must not play this dishonourable game."
"A majority of Czechs want the Charter in its entirety, including the social sections."
"It is sad, regrettable and demeaning to the role of the Czech President to drag the Sudeten Germans into this game 65 years after the end of the Second World War."
"Both the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans have experienced more than enough horror and suffering through war and displacement."
"I firmly believe that both the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans have learned from this tragic experience and that the Czechs, Germans and Sudeten Germans want to live together and build a new united Europe together in peace and cooperation."
"Mr President, the Swedish Presidency and the Commission both refer to the importance of an EU agreement on the financing of climate change measures for developing countries."
"I agree."
"But the offer on the table from the Commission is a smoke-and-mirrors proposal which developing counties have every reason to question."
"Mr Barroso said just now that the carbon market in emerging countries will cover most of the EUR 100 billion a year estimated cost of climate change mitigation and adaptation."
"But there is no certainty that the international carbon market will deliver EUR 38 billion a year in financial flow to developing countries."
"We have seen how unstable the carbon price has been in the EU ETS and how long it is taking for a proper carbon market to emerge."
"A further major flaw is the assumption that developing and emerging countries will be happy to fund their own energy efficiency measures."
"That is absurd."
"What is blocking energy efficiency in our own Member States is the lack of up-front funding mechanisms, yet we are assuming that developing countries can find their own money."
"We need to have extra finance."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make three comments on the forthcoming Council meeting."
"Firstly, the Irish 'yes' vote is, in my opinion, primarily a result of the financial crisis, while the banks were rescued a year ago with taxpayers' money."
"Now the bankers will once again be receiving record salaries."
"The EU will certainly be measured by the extent to which it can bring an end to the disappearance of billions of euros of tax payers' money into this black hole."
"Secondly, new faces are filling the top positions within the EU as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Their professional qualifications are definitely second-rate, because the majority of the candidates are failed politicians who have been voted out of power in their native countries."
"Who will represent the EU now?"
"The Council President, the High Representative or the Commission President?"
"There is certain to be chaos."
"My third comment, Mr President, is as follows."
"If President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic signs the Treaty of Lisbon, on the condition that a footnote is included which ensures that the Beneš Decrees remain in force, in other words, decrees which run contrary to international law and human rights, then there will be two types of fundamental rights: those for Germans, for Sudeten Germans and for all the others."
"That cannot be allowed to happen!"
"Mr President, with the Lisbon Treaty approaching, we expect the October European Council to make progress on one of the priority issues - the European External Action Service."
"The European Parliament has consistently called for the creation of a genuine common European diplomacy."
"The EAS has the potential to ensure the unity and consistency of our external action, which is most needed if the Union is to act with one voice and meet external challenges such as energy security in an efficient manner."
"To seize the opportunity offered by setting up the EAS, we expect the Council to take into consideration the position of the European Parliament adopted this week in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and especially the following."
"To have a strong external policy, we need to equip the new head of European diplomacy with proper instruments to enable him or her to strengthen our foreign policy."
"The EAS should be based on the Community method with the clear involvement of the Commission and the European Parliament."
"The scope of the HR's competence needs to be large, involving such CFSP-related policies as enlargement, neighbourhood, trade and development."
"The condition for a strong, coherent foreign policy is democratic legitimacy, which can only be provided by the strong involvement of the European Parliament."
"This involvement should be considered at two stages: ex ante consultation of the Parliament during the process of setting up the service, and ex ante consultation of the Parliament in setting foreign policy goals."
"Once the High Representative and the service are in place, the European Parliament should have a strong mandate to play an active role in the scrutiny of the EU's foreign policy and the service."
"In the implementation phase, we should not allow the Lisbon Treaty-based foreign policy provisions to be diluted."
"The democratic legitimacy of the new service also depends on its composition."
"The geographic balance of the Union should be taken into account."
"Fair representation of all Member States in the EU institutions is a core principle, and the EAS should be no exception."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, more than four months after the election of this European Parliament, you are going to convene a European Council at a time of indecision for the European Union, with a Commission which is still in place to deal with day-to-day matters."
"If we do not want to drive European citizens completely to despair, it seems to me that this European Council could send out two messages."
"The first is that, one year after the solidarity shown by all European states regarding the banks, you must start a European debate on the tax on financial transactions or on the contribution that the banks must make to Member States' budgets to ensure solidarity in return."
"Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the European Commission, the President of the Commission yesterday told us that he was supporting the budget as set out today and that, one year after the recovery plan, nothing new would be included. However, over the last year, the situation on the employment front and the debt front has become considerably worse."
"The budget proposed to us today is a budget which will not even finance the second part of the recovery plan that you designed a year ago."
"So this is the advice that the European Council must act on: taxation of financial transactions, solidarity of the banks with regard to Member States' budgets and a real recovery plan, as it was initiated a year ago, even though we criticised it at the time for not going far enough."
"Mr President, firstly, I am pleased to see my former colleague Cecilia Malmström here, particularly in light of the convincing 'yes' to Lisbon in Ireland, followed by the signature of the democratically elected Polish President."
"I think these two further endorsements will, I hope, facilitate the Swedish Presidency to preside over the full ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"However, most European citizens are far more concerned about what the EU is doing to deal with the current economic crisis rather than the detail of Lisbon."
"So I say to my Eurosceptic friends: 'Get over it'."
"Before the Irish 'yes' vote, 27 million EU citizens voted 'yes', 24 million voted 'no'."
"That is democratic legitimacy."
"So let us deal with the real world."
"In this context, I want to speak about the Progress Microfinance Facility, which will give those who are unemployed a chance of a new start and open up the way to entrepreneurship."
"This facility will provide EUR 100 million and could leverage a further EUR 500 million of microcredit."
"But I am saying to the Commission and to the Council: this is not nearly enough."
"This is a real opportunity for the EU to be responsive to the real needs of its citizens, but we need greater investment."
"(NL) Mr President, it is good that the European Union is savouring the success of the Irish referendum for a while."
"We should also count our blessings that an important step has been taken towards the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Of course, we are all concerned about the Czech Republic."
"We shall await the court ruling with respect, but please do be patient and sensible in your dealings with Mr Klaus."
"If we hit out at him, it could well be counterproductive."
"Copenhagen and the success of this conference is a source of hope, not only for Europe but also for the world."
"Sustainability is a source of technological development."
"Important technological developments in Europe, for example, CO2 storage, can also help to combat the economic crisis."
"This brings me to my third point: the economic crisis."
"We want a citizens' Europe."
"More attention should be devoted to employment, and the Council's plans are good in that respect."
"Yet these plans are still very remote to many citizens, who are largely unaware of them."
"Financial supervision of banking institutions is also very important, and I hope you are able to make progress on this, too, next week."
"Finally, the approach to the asylum issue."
"I strongly support the intentions of the Swedish Presidency, but tangible results, including from the Council deliberations, have failed to materialise."
"Last week, at the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the complaint was raised that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are still achieving too few tangible results."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the time has come for this House to stop the endless debate on the Treaty of Lisbon, which we have still heard going on today."
"I believe that we must respect the wishes of this Parliament, of the great European countries, of the 27 and of the 26 that have ratified this treaty in various forms, but democratically, and thus the offences to the treaty and its democratic content must also be rejected."
"I also believe that the Council meeting at the end of the month will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the need to revive the idea of Europe beyond Lisbon and to revive the economy, as well as to ensure that Europe does not back down over the major issue of climate change."
"From that perspective, I believe that what we have heard lately from the President-in-Office, but also what we have heard today, is insufficient."
"Europe beyond Lisbon is failing to interpret the strong content of the new treaty and is failing to comply with the terms of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Therefore, if we 500 million Europeans want to remain the world's biggest economic power, a power that is preparing to become a major political player on the international stage, I urge the Commission to fully carry out its mandate of proposing European legislation on the major issues relating to the economy, the economic recovery and the labour market recovery, and I urge the Council to turn a long list of headings into an actual policy to help resolve the economic difficulties."
"This is what I believe we are lacking."
"We are lacking a major economic recovery plan, we are lacking in major areas such as the revival of the infrastructure policy with Eurobonds, and we are lacking a high-profile European approach."
"This is what we expect from the European Council at the end of the month."
"Mr President, it is extremely important to fight the economic crisis, and that also means helping the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must be committed to the outcome of the Stoiber Committee, and I want to hear from both the Commission and the Council whether they are committed to this process and what we are going to do, because we have to cut red tape."
"Another point I would like to discuss is the Ankara Protocol."
"The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a public interview in The Hague that Turkey will not ratify or implement the Ankara Protocol."
"That is a statement in an authorised interview in de Volkskrant of 7 October 2009."
"What are we going to do?"
"We cannot, as Commissioner Rehn said in the Foreign Affairs Committee, just kindly ask again."
"The deadline is 1 November."
"What action are we going to take?"
"(SV) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, it is nice to see you here."
"I would like to mention two things ahead of the European Council summit."
"The first point I would like to raise concerns the climate."
"I think it is important to go into the negotiations with the goal that the best solution to the issue is a solution that involves everyone making a joint commitment."
"I say this because, in the debate, we sometimes talk as if it was a matter of formulating the best solution here in Europe or in a particular country."
"However, that is not enough if we are unable to get China, India and a whole host of other countries that are currently not involved in the joint climate commitment on board."
"This means that pragmatism and results must take precedence."
"This type of solution must also be based on all countries being prepared to make a commitment."
"It must not be the case that commitments and policies in other parts of the world are based on continued investments from Europe."
"They must instead be based on a sound economy, sound growth and the sound development of new opportunities - with the help of Europe and other wealthy countries."
"My second point concerns the financial markets."
"I think it is important to emphasise that, more than anything else, stability on the financial markets requires what we call a stable macro-economy, in other words, stable public finances."
"This means that the debate about getting away from the large budget deficits is much more important than what individual financial market regulations should look like."
"However, it is also the case that stable financial markets require us to have stable growth, stable investments and the creation of new jobs."
"This means that, when we legislate on the financial markets, that legislation needs to involve better supervision, cross-border measures and transparency, but not so many regulations that investments and growth happen in other countries."
"That would put the stability of our own economy and our own financial markets under threat."
"(ES) Mr President, the positive outcome of the Irish referendum makes the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty more plausible and imminent than ever."
"This is good news, as it means that we will finally have institutions that are able to take action."
"First of all, they will be able to help us emerge from the crisis and address its social dimension, namely the matter of generating employment."
"However, in addition to this, climate change, energy and the rules of fair trade should also be on the agenda."
"The Summit also provides an opportunity to provide the initial, decisive momentum required to determine the membership of the new Commission, and we have already heard President Barroso make predictions concerning the selection criteria."
"I would like to highlight the importance of two things."
"Firstly, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I think that the membership of the Commission should be balanced."
"The S&D Group has mentioned how significant it would be for the High Representative to be a member of this political family, but there is no doubt that it is also important to ensure a gender balance."
"On the other hand, the group also mentioned the distribution of portfolios and referred to one which is important to me as a lawyer who is committed to freedom, and as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which is related to the subdivision of the Directorate-General for Justice and Home Affairs into a DG dealing with matters concerning justice and fundamental rights and another dedicated to security matters."
"I think that this is not the right solution."
"The right solution does not involve subordinating justice to the importance of security or setting them up against each other, but rather in creating a Directorate-General for Justice and Fundamental Rights, a second Directorate-General for Home Affairs and a third one which does not link security with immigration but instead separates them, thereby creating a Directorate-General for Security and another for Immigration, Asylum and Refugees, which includes the field of fundamental rights."
"Mr President, in our debates about these summits, you will find if you go back over 10 years that many ideas, many similar plans or proposals have come forward from Members within this House, from members of the Council and also from Commissioners, and, if anything, the last year has proven one thing to me, namely that when the Union acts together in solidarity with big plans and big ambitions, it moves the world."
"Maybe now is the time for greater plans and bigger ambitions as regards how we move forward."
"Many have spoken about the scourge of unemployment which has come upon so many people in the last number of months, and have said that now is the time to take serious action to remove the dead wood of regulation and get rid of the dead wood of blockages to businesses and to entrepreneurs creating those businesses."
"Could I say that when we speak about solidarity, it is not about the big against the small, and one fear that I have is that the new G20 could impact negatively on small countries and medium-sized countries which are emerging in these new markets."
"Finally a word to the President-in-Office: you might put the issue of copyright term extension on the agenda for the Council as well under the Swedish Presidency."
"Mr President, with the Lisbon Treaty about to enter into force, this is an historic moment to concentrate first of all on Europe's common future and common good."
"I am afraid that it is not the best opportunity to use these last moments to advance national interests, playing on the nerves of other partners."
"Global challenges to Europe cannot be solved without efficient common institutions and common policies."
"However, today's Europe needs more than ever the far-sightedness, moral commitment and perception of common European values that inspired our founding fathers to break the vicious circle of history and national egoisms."
"That is why we need for Europe's progress and credibility in the world not necessarily good conductors of affairs but real statesmen, strong democratic leaders having a vision and authority to bring about a change also in Europe."
"Therefore we need a clear commitment to, and practical implementation of, European common institutions."
"We need not only a common foreign and security policy, with an external service, but also a common energy policy."
"The European Council will also approve the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the Swedish Presidency once again for taking it on board. Now, the task of the Council is to implement it without losing time."
"I hope that the Baltic Sea Strategy will get the attention it deserves, also from the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies."
"I support the idea of Minister Malmström that the Baltic Sea Strategy can be seen as a model pilot project for other macroregions of Europe."
"Nevertheless, no EU strategy will be taken seriously without having sufficient resources for its implementation."
"The existing budget line needs some money and some credibility."
"(PT) I would like to make two brief points."
"The first is about the Treaty of Lisbon: following the 'yes' vote in Ireland and the signing by the President of Poland, it is expected that the Constitutional Tribunal of the Czech Republic will deliver its opinion and President Klaus will do what he should, and sign the Treaty."
"The Council cannot give in to the blackmail of the President of the Czech Republic."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is essential for the better functioning of the European institutions, in addition to providing other benefits, such as strengthening the powers of the European Parliament and the rights of citizens."
"That is why it is imperative that the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force soon."
"The Council and the Commission should give President Klaus a deadline for him to start behaving like the President of a democratic country that is a member of the European Union."
"We cannot entertain the thought for one moment that the whim of some leader can prevail over the will of the majority."
"My second point is about the Copenhagen conference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the world needs a global agreement to fight climate change; both developed and developing countries need to stop the planet from overheating, and so they need to pool their efforts and make a courageous decision."
"Copenhagen is our big opportunity to avoid catastrophe, as the scientists say."
"There is no argument to be had in invoking the financial crisis as a reason to delay or scale down the plans for Copenhagen, and such attempts are not to be taken seriously."
"We need a sense of ambition if we are to save the planet."
"Mr President, within a generation, the population of the European Union will be about 6% of the world's population."
"We are not far beyond that now, which is why we simply cannot continue to rotate the presidency of the European Council every six months and have up to five different people speaking on foreign affairs-related issues for the Union."
"But also within that generation, the population of the world will have increased by about two billion people."
"Ninety per cent of that increase will be in what is now the developing world, where up to 11 million children die each year, about five million of them for want of medicines that have been available in what we call the West for over 30 years."
"In that context it is not only important that we are well organised to run Europe internally; it is also important that we are equipped to deal with situations like this in the developing world, which is why I want to make a case for a strong, independent, separate Commissioner for development aid who will have his or her own clear budget and remit and who will be accountable to this Chamber through our Committee on Development."
"It is crucially important that the High Representative, Minister for External Affairs, whatever title you want to give that person, will have a lot on his or her plate, much to do, but there is one single issue which commands and must command our particular attention."
"I want to advocate strongly that not only do we continue to have an office of Commissioner for Development, but that this portfolio is given to somebody who is equal to the task and determined to ensure that these, our neighbours who are a short journey away from the European Union, are treated with respect, this for selfish as well as selfless reasons."
"(SK) The most important item for the forthcoming Council meeting will be to complete the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and to bring the Treaty to life."
"The process ushered in by the Lisbon Treaty will strengthen the Union both internally and in a global context."
"Strengthening the position of the Union is closely connected with strengthening cooperation in the area of the current third pillar."
"The Union will be more open, more effective and more democratic."
"The main challenge and priority is to secure fundamental rights and freedoms as well as integrity and security in Europe."
"The way to achieve these objectives is full support, effective implementation and sufficient respect for existing laws and instruments relating to the protection of human rights and civic freedoms."
"The Stockholm Programme emphasises the assertion of these rights, especially in the areas of justice and security."
"We must give precedence to mechanisms which facilitate the access of citizens to the courts so that their rights and lawful interests can be enforced throughout the Union."
"It must also be our strategy to strengthen police cooperation and the enforcement of rights as well as improving security in Europe."
"The internal security strategy must be developed with a view to combating mounting extremism in the Member States, eliminating the tension stirred up by irresponsible politicians and through concrete solutions over such sensitive questions as, for example, immigration, asylum policy or the issue of the Roma and national minorities in such a way that these issues are not exploited by right-wing extremists."
"Properly organised migration can benefit all of the parties involved."
"Europe will need a flexible immigration policy which can respond to the needs of society and the labour market in the various EU Member States."
"In relation to securing a credible immigration and asylum policy which is sustainable in the long-term, we must, however, pay close attention to the problem of illegal migration, which is a serious concern for our citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, be brave, be brave, be brave, that is the recommendation that I feel like making ahead of the Council meeting and, for this reason, when it comes to debating the nominations for the new commissioners, the new European Union Foreign Affairs Minister and the President of the European Council - thus the people who, together with President Barroso and the other commissioners, will have to oversee European policy in the near future - the only method of decision making to be used is that of considering the best possible interests of European citizens."
"Therefore, the people who should be chosen are those who have depth as politicians and human beings, whose national and European political efforts have been distinguished by a concern for the common good."
"These must be the foundations on which we continue to address the major issues such as climate change, investigating further perhaps the requirements of the various economies and the economic crisis, with the aid of courageous initiatives such as the Eurobonds, which we should also put on the agenda of the next Council meeting."
"To conclude, I should like to cite the words uttered by Pope Benedict XVI the other day - which I would be delighted, just once, to see upheld in the next European Council too - because they are words that provide a timely reminder of the responsibility shared by all citizens and by all political representatives, which is to fulfil the request that we seek in unity and in the common search for truth, that crucial incentive that we need to start building something important for ourselves and for future generations."
"Progress and civilisation are born of unity, and Europe was great when it conveyed these fundamental values that it derived from the Christian faith, turning them into the nations' cultural heritage and identity."
"For this reason, I believe that it is clear which path we must follow in order to be able to overcome the crucial challenge of relaunching Europe as a global power."
"(CS) Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty is a key issue."
"The jurisprudence of the Czech Constitutional Court is consistent and I do not believe that the Court would have found next week that the Treaty was inconsistent with the Czech constitution."
"I doubt, however, that the President will end his obstruction."
"The Czech Republic, however, does not have a presidential system and the government can bring an action against such a president for exceeding his authority."
"It is a fact that Václav Klaus refused for years to appoint a particular lawyer as a judge simply because he had lost a dispute with him in court, nor does he respect the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court."
"Along with this lawyer, 500 million European citizens have become hostages to the whims of our President."
"The damage is not inconsiderable."
"At a time of crisis, the appointment of a new Commission is being held up, Parliament lacks the powers to resolve the budget, the national parliaments cannot, in the meantime, issue yellow or red cards and we are not making use of new powers to combat epidemics, energy crises, terrorism and organised crime or the new principles in civil defence and humanitarian aid."
"It is possible the Charter may be rejected, all because of the defunct Beneš Decrees."
"This is simply absurd, not only because of the timing, but also because there are no legal grounds for it."
"Article 345 of the Lisbon Treaty even states explicitly that it does not apply to ownership issues in the Member States."
"The Charter does not create new legal possibilities over and above those that already exist for ownership disputes in the Czech Republic."
"In addition, Regulation 44 on the recognition of judgments does not take ownership issues 50 years back into the past."
"The Czech media are nonetheless seething with doubts."
"What is really going on in the Czech Republic?"
"It is clear that the next presidential election in the Czech Republic will be hard fought and Václav Klaus is endeavouring, through this piece of theatre, to cultivate the image of a powerful leader who can take on the entire EU single-handedly and defend the property of Czechs against foreigners."
"I appreciate the fact that the EU did not put any pressure on the Czech Republic, and I would like to call for patience until the democratic deficit caused by our President is resolved at home, well ahead of the elections in the UK."
"In conclusion, I would like to call again on the Council to stand by the Czech Republic in opposition to the one-sided introduction of visa requirements by Canada against Czech citizens and to take a decision on joint sanctions."
"(EL) Mr President, my speech will concentrate on three points."
"First point: the economic crisis."
"The crisis indiscriminately hit all the economic systems, both the strong and the less strong."
"If we interpret ten years' experience of EMU in light of the economic crisis, it is clear that economic policy needs to be more europeanised."
"It is also clear that economic risk needs to be europeanised."
"Trust is good, control is even better."
"Second point: climate change."
"The European Union is rightly at the vanguard of global ecological diplomacy."
"I absolutely agree with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, that, in the run-up to the Copenhagen Summit, there is no plan Β."
"The ecological debt burdens everyone without exception."
"I support the idea of creating a global climate bank, which will have funds from the Emissions Bank to finance efforts by developing countries to create environmentally-friendly development standards."
"Third point: immigration."
"Obviously we need to proceed more quickly in adopting a common immigration policy."
"However, there are also foreign policy aspects to immigration."
"We must proceed as quickly as possible in establishing effective foreign policy relations with third countries, because there is a great deal of pressure on countries, especially in southern Europe."
"I wish to say quite clearly that Turkey's stance is provocative."
"I was pleased to hear the Swedish Presidency point that out."
"The European Union's message to Turkey - and to other countries - must be loud, clear and effective."
"This framework forms part of the Community acquis and everyone must respect it."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström and Mr Barroso have covered the subject of climate change and the preparations for Copenhagen."
"I agree with everyone who says that the Council must draw some ambitious conclusions."
"However, I would advise against looking only at the industry which has been covered by the Emissions Trading System since 2005, when considering both financing and the issue of who must bring about the reduction."
"We need more industries to shoulder the burden."
"More than 50% of emissions are not yet included in the Emissions Trading System."
"We need more industries to take responsibility in order to achieve our objectives and to guarantee financing."
"I am referring to the air transport and shipping industries."
"I have been disappointed by the actions of the Council and the Commission up to now."
"During the preparations for Pittsburgh, this subject was not included in the Council's conclusions."
"If we want to be successful in Copenhagen, it is essential that we speed up what we are doing."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety did this on Monday."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission to look at this in more detail."
"Secondly, I would like to say that I know that the discussions will be very informal, but the Council must also be discussing the composition of the new Commission."
"In all modesty, I would like to make a suggestion."
"For historical reasons, pharmaceutical legislation has come under the supervision of the Directorate General for Industry and the Commissioner for Industry."
"Of course, pharmaceutical legislation is a matter for industry, but it is also a health issue."
"In all the Member States, in the European Parliament, even in the US, this area forms part of health policy."
"Therefore, perhaps it is now time to try a change in this area."
"Please ask the Commission President to take a look at this issue."
"Mr President, President Barroso mentioned here yesterday, in his nice response to Mr Farage, that in the EU we need the President of the Council to be a true European."
"I am sure both of you and many here share that view."
"Do we also need somebody in that position who would be a true 'Gazpromian', like Gerhard Schröder, Paavo Lipponen, etc.?"
"Or maybe you think those qualities are pretty compatible, so a good 'Gazpromian', especially if they voted for friendly and bribing relations, is the best European."
"That way, we could speed up the current development of the EU towards becoming the 'GU' - the 'Gazprom Union' - and so avoid the situation in which Russia totally ignores the EU while working exclusively on splitting it."
"What is your opinion about 'Gazpromians' for the Presidency?"
"(PL) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has not yet been ratified, and is still only a draft political document."
"This means that, in the European Union, we remain bound by the principle of unanimity."
"Every country has the right to declare reservations."
"The President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, is acting within the framework of established rules."
"Putting pressure on the President in fact affects not only him personally, but also the many millions of citizens of the countries of Europe who have announced serious reservations about this document."
"At the forthcoming European Council, the leaders of the Member States of the European Union should think deeply about the advisability and the consequences of consciously by-passing the will of the citizens whom they represent."
"(RO) The European Council will be invited to adopt the strategy on the Baltic Sea region."
"I believe that this provides a good model for the European Union's future strategy on the Danube region."
"The Danube region covers 10 states, six of which are Member States of the European Union, with a population of 200 million. This number includes 75 million people who live in areas bordering the Danube."
"This is why I think that it is important for this model to be used for the Danube strategy as well, which will need to have an action plan and action programme for the coming years."
"Still on the subject of the European Council's programme, I also think that it is of paramount importance for us to adopt at European level the financial instruments required for the development of an 'eco-efficient' economy."
"I am talking, in this case, about energy efficiency in buildings and sustainable transport in particular."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Madam Vice-President of the European Commission, my question concerns the application of the Treaty of Lisbon, especially the promise made to the Irish people to have one Commissioner per country."
"In December 2008, it was agreed that the European Council would take the appropriate legal measures to ensure we have one Commissioner per country."
"Mrs Malmström, what are these legal measures?"
"Information is being circulated that there would be an amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon with the accession treaty of Croatia, or are there other appropriate legal arrangements?"
"Could you provide us with this information?"
"How do you also envisage increasing the number of MEPs by 18, since there are 18 extra MEPs who should constitute the next European Parliament with the next Treaty of Lisbon?"
"(PT) Mr President, this coming Council should give absolute priority to changing the liberal policies that have led to the severe economic and social crisis."
"This should be the time to face up to the poverty experienced by around 80 million citizens of the European Union, including more than 30 million workers whose wages are so low that they and their families merely survive, and are unable to escape from their state of poverty."
"This should be the time to commit to tackling the severe unemployment which continues to rise, and which could reach 30 million within the next year if we do not take appropriate measures immediately."
"This Council's main challenge, therefore, is to break with the neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability Pact."
"These should be replaced with a real programme for progress and social development that will promote high-quality public services, support production and micro-, small and medium-sized businesses, valuing those who work, and creating more employment with rights, including jobs for women and young people."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, according to some rumours I have heard, there is an idea going around about how to possibly get the Czech Republic's President Klaus on board, which is to somehow incorporate the Beneš Decrees into the Treaty of Lisbon afterwards."
"I would like us to guard against this kind of legal jiggery-pokery and nonsense for three reasons."
"Firstly, I believe that we would create a dangerous precedent whereby any constitutional expert would feel that they can interfere in a contract retrospectively and, as we can see, this is dangerous because the Slovak government has already stated that if Klaus can do so, they would like to as well."
"Therefore, I think that this would be a dangerous precedent."
"Secondly, it is wrong to cite the Irish as an example."
"What the Irish were asking for was also originally included in the Treaty of Lisbon, and they were not objecting to what was not in it."
"Therefore, their request did not encounter any legal obstacle."
"Thirdly, the content of 13 of the 143 Beneš Decrees disenfranchised Hungarians and Germans."
"I believe that the European Union cannot allow reference to be made to such documents."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to continue with the argument from my speech yesterday on the preparations for the Copenhagen summit, and then mention yesterday's Ecofin meeting, which was not hugely successful."
"I was questioning you on the responsibility we have as industrialised countries to behave in such a way that developing countries can follow us in our efforts to combat climate change."
"At Copenhagen, we cannot act as if we all have the same capabilities - this would mean that we were all starting from the same place, to arrive nowhere in the end."
"Therefore, to convince our partners in development to join us, we must obviously address the question of the aid they should be given and not wait for the results of the Copenhagen Summit."
"At the next European Council and in the important context of climate change, the 27 absolutely must agree on the way the European Union thinks about aid to developing countries."
"Yesterday, as I said, the Ecofin Council of Finance Ministers did not manage to reach a common position on this set of problems."
"However, we know that this issue is absolutely central."
"The European Commission had already made its proposals and I very much hope that we can take the initiative and carry our partners with us to achieve the global solidarity required to overcome the problem of climate change."
"(FR) Mr President, my question is aimed at the Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"You know that the central issue regarding the future Presidency of the European Council is knowing whether he or she intends to prefer the Community method in all circumstances."
"Do you think this criterion should be made a precondition of the appointment of the President-in-Office of the Council?"
"Recently we have, from time to time, witnessed intergovernmental drift."
"I think it is time to close this period and return to the beginning of the European integration process and to stay faithful to the legacy of Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we always talk about the 'economic and financial crisis' in quotation marks."
"Why do we not refer to a structural crisis?"
"All of this began with a genuine banking crisis which included the investment banks."
"This is one industry, but the entire world economy suffered as a result."
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen, the conference in Copenhagen will soon be upon us and yet we have only moved a small step forward since last year's conference."
"We ought to have achieved a great deal more and acted with greater determination."
"We find ourselves struggling, not only with the financing, but even to make a commitment on individual countries' emission reduction targets."
"Industrialised countries need to play a more visible role on this score and we need to send a clear message to the United States of America."
"The specific difficulty which we face with the United States is that we know that they will not even have passed the necessary national legislation by the time December comes round."
"I think that we should clearly voice our expectation that President Obama deliver on one of his most important pre-election pledges, i.e. that America would play a proactive role in countering climate change."
"Likewise, we should clearly voice our expectation that President Obama take advantage of his appearance in person to bring about a successful conclusion to the conference."
"(CS) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council is undoubtedly an important body and it should therefore resolve fundamental issues."
"The number one issue is to provide work that can ensure people a decent standard of living."
"I am surprised by the succession of meaningless speeches which betray a lack of knowledge and foolishly mix together a bizarre goulash of revanchist demands and extreme liberal methods."
"The European Council should reject such voices out of hand and, at the same time give, a clear signal that its primary aim is to get industry moving again and to resolve the critical situation in agriculture."
"If, instead of this, it accedes to cuts in the social area, along with relief for banks and the most wealthy, then no positive impulse can be expected, especially if there is an insistence on abstract criteria of financial stability."
"In conclusion, I would like to say to all those who have desperately resisted ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by referendum: put your own house in order, and if you are unable to explain what is good about this Treaty to your own citizens, do not lecture others."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to mention the challenges we must face and overcome in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, namely, establishing a proper, joint migration and asylum policy; effective control of our external borders; an effective integration and repatriation policy, a Eurojust that is credible and trustworthy; a Europol to serve the Community, under the control of the European Parliament; progress in terms of harmonising the field of civil and criminal justice; effective transatlantic relations, especially with the United States, based on trust and equality; an equitable solution to the issue of SWIFT data; an effective data protection policy; better protection for the euro against counterfeiting and active promotion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"(FR) Mr President, my question is very simple."
"We have a newly-appointed President for the new Commission, but when will we have this new Commission?"
"In these difficult times, it is impossible to work with a Commission half of whose members are already packing their bags."
"We need a new impetus in Europe - we need this new Commission soon."
"Mr President, one of the lessons to be learnt from the recent referendum in Ireland is that a good PR campaign makes a big difference."
"In June 2008, the Irish people voted against the Lisbon Treaty."
"A little over a year afterwards, they voted by a two-thirds majority in favour."
"Did the European Union have a much greater impact on their lives in the interim?"
"No."
"But the message of the European Union was sold far better by the 'yes' side in the second campaign."
"Particularly now with the Lisbon Treaty coming into being, I think it is important with the new competences that much good work will be done."
"However, the Commission must also engage in a proper PR strategy to bring that good work home to the citizens."
"So I would ask the Commission what plans they have in that regard so that future referenda will be passed much more easily than in the past."
"(RO) Mr President, my name is Luhan, not Luman."
"I warmly welcome the fact that the political groups are in support of promoting the ratification process."
"To ensure that the European Union can operate efficiently, we need the Treaty of Lisbon and we need it to come into force as soon as possible."
"At the moment, the Czech Republic is the only Member State which has still not ratified the Treaty."
"As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has already said, we are calling for President Klaus to show a responsible attitude and ratify the Treaty by the date of the European Council at the end of October."
"Otherwise, we are going to remain stuck in this institutional debate and we are not going to be able to focus on the real problems which ordinary citizens are facing, such as the economic and financial crisis, unemployment and social inclusion, nor are we going to be able to reinforce the European Union's image as a genuine global player."
"I believe that we have discussed the merits of this Treaty so much that there is no point in us reviving this debate."
"What we are interested in now is that at the next European Council, we can confirm that the ratification process has been finalised in all Member States so that we can move on to the next stage of establishing the College of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions and comments."
"We often talk about a citizens' Europe, the people's Europe, and then we interpret this to suit our own political purposes."
"There is actually nothing wrong with this, but if we ask the citizens 'what do you want from Europe?', then the citizens of all the European States say 'we want cooperation in Europe that is based on a number of values and that solves our common problems - the economic crisis, unemployment, the climate issues, international crime, the migration problem and so on'."
"That is what we are here to do."
"Many of these issues will be discussed at the summit in ten days' time."
"Of course, we will not succeed in solving all of them, but hopefully, we will be able to take some important steps in the right direction and thereby create more of a 'citizens' Europe'."
"We must take these decisions in a way that is democratic, open and allows transparency."
"We may each have different views on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The view held by the Swedish Presidency and the Council and, I believe, the majority in this Chamber, is that the Treaty of Lisbon will bring Europe closer to the citizens."
"We will take decisions in a more efficient and democratic way and we will also lend increased strength and weight to the European Union in our global relations."
"It is therefore important to get the Treaty in place and I can guarantee that we will do our utmost to ensure that this happens as soon as possible."
"There is still no solution with regard to the Czech President."
"I have heard that there is some speculation here, but nevertheless there is still no solution."
"We are in intensive talks with our friends in Prague and we hope very, very soon to be able to present to you a proposal for resolving this issue."
"I would like to point out that we must, of course, await the ruling of the Czech constitutional court before we can go any further."
"In the meantime, preparations will continue with regard to codecision with Parliament and to the European External Action Service, which we will discuss this afternoon."
"I will return to many of the views that have been expressed and other questions relating to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We have had very constructive cooperation with your President, Mr Buzek, and his colleagues concerning how Parliament, the Council and the Commission can cooperate once the new rules are in place."
"A few questions have been asked about Afghanistan."
"Yes, Mrs de Sarnez, we hope to be able to make progress in discussions on a more unified European view with regard to Afghanistan, based both on the military presence that the European Union has there and on increased support for civil society and the democratic, state-building processes."
"Intensive discussions are being held right now on how we can support the election that is to take place on 7 November."
"That is very soon."
"It is difficult to put European election observers in place in such a short space of time, but we will, of course, do our best to achieve this."
"The European Union's long-term goal, which we support, is to have a common asylum and migration policy."
"We will not manage this by the end of the year, partly because we need the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force first."
"However, I do agree with you that it is important."
"In the meantime, we are working on the Stockholm Programme and one of the things we are discussing in this connection is migration-related issues."
"They are very complex issues, of course, and concern cooperation with third countries, trade, aid and the possibility of introducing a framework so that we can also have legal immigration into Europe."
"They also concern solidarity and reception systems."
"The Commission will report on the progress that has been made in this regard."
"We will then take further decisions in December."
"Mr van Baalen, the issue of the Ankara Protocol is important."
"We often say to our Turkish friends that they must ratify and implement the Ankara Protocol."
"This issue will not be discussed at this summit, but we will discuss enlargement later in the autumn, with a possible decision being taken in December."
"Therefore, I will certainly return to this issue again."
"With regard to the number of commissioners, the European Council has, of course, decided that each State is to have one commissioner."
"Under the present Treaty, it would be possible to change this in 2014."
"As soon as the Treaty is in place, we will have time to review any legal adjustments that may be required to guarantee that every State can retain its commissioner, and we will do this."
"We are in talks with the various legal bodies to see whether further amendments to the Treaty will be necessary or whether it is sufficient for the European Council to decide this unanimously."
"The same applies with regard to the 18 extra MEPs."
"As soon as the Treaty is in place, we will begin preparations for this."
"A number of States have already made preparations in order to be able to send the Members in question here quickly."
"Mr Audy, the national voting system is a bit more complicated in some States."
"It may, therefore, take some time."
"I hope that the preparations get underway as soon as possible."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament has allowed these Members to be observers while they are waiting to formally become MEPs."
"Together with the forthcoming Spanish Presidency, we will do our best to ensure that this goes as quickly and as smoothly as possible."
"Finally, I would like to express my thanks, not only for this debate, but also for the extremely strong support that this House is giving the Presidency with regard to the issue of the climate."
"We will do our utmost to make it possible to take decisions on European funding at the European Council meeting, based both on the European contribution and on our contribution in relation to the developing countries, thereby allowing us to send out a strong signal and to give the international negotiations a boost to make them as successful as possible in Copenhagen."
"It is the most serious and important task facing our generation to take appropriate, concrete steps to combat global warming and put in place a global regulation."
"I am very grateful for the support and commitment that the European Parliament is showing in this regard."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, thank you very much for this lively and interesting debate."
"It is very clear that the sense of urgency about the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty is tangible in this House and in this debate."
"As you will understand, the Commission, like Parliament, is eagerly awaiting the entry into force of this new Treaty."
"We all know that the political process of approval has now been concluded in all Member States."
"It is, of course, for each Member State to finalise the ratification process and, in so doing, they have to respect their internal procedures, but it is also clear that no individual Member State acts in a vacuum."
"Their decisions or delays will have an impact on all."
"We of course hope that the Czech Republic will very soon be in a position to ratify the Treaty."
"I would also like to remind everybody here about the loyal cooperation that is one of the principles and main features of the European Union."
"I think it is of crucial importance that Member States can trust each other on the commitments made."
"May I also comment on the fact that many of the Members of Parliament here have made a distinction or a divide between reality - with unemployment and an economic crisis - on the one hand, and the text of the Lisbon Treaty on the other, but of course, the whole idea is that the text of the Lisbon Treaty is there to deal with the context and that we will be better equipped to take effective decisions on immigration or asylum policy, on energy security, etc. This is the whole idea, and we have to link them instead of dividing them, but we hope that we will very soon come to the end of this eternal debate on institutional issues and be able to use these new effective instruments."
"The Commission is now working actively to prepare for implementation when the Treaty enters into force."
"I know that this afternoon, you will be devoting a specific debate to the External Action Service."
"This is therefore not the time to enter into a full discussion on that issue."
"But I would say that we are facing a real challenge here."
"It is a challenge to draw together the different players in the field of external relations, and the overall aim has to be to achieve a diplomatic synergy."
"A certain degree of creative thinking is necessary while respecting the interinstitutional balance."
"We also need the Service to be fully accountable to this House - to the European Parliament."
"I strongly believe that the setting-up of the External Action Service can be a success if Council, Parliament and the Commission work closely together."
"We must also respect the fact that it is for the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission to make a proposal in agreement with the Commission."
"On another important issue, the European Citizens' Initiative, the Commission intends to launch a Green Paper in mid-November."
"We intend to hold a broad consultation with citizens, civil society and all stakeholders in order to launch the legislative proposals very soon after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The consequences of the economic and financial crisis will appear high up on the Council agenda."
"We heard this particular theme evoked often during the debate."
"I agree with those who said that there is no room for complacency."
"It is true that the policies in response to the crisis are starting to bear some fruit - financial markets are starting to consolidate and confidence is improving - but we are far from full recovery and the consequences of unemployment are, and will remain, very severe."
"Political efforts must also continue to support active labour market policies."
"The Commission of course - and I say this in response to some of the questions raised during the debate - stands by its budget proposal."
"We hope that Parliament will also confirm our ambitions by your vote."
"As President Barroso said yesterday in the Question Hour, what has been done so far is not enough."
"The employment situation is such that we all need to do more at European, but also at national, level."
"Unemployment is our first concern today and we hope that we can count on the European Parliament in continuing work on this, and also to put pressure on the Council, and at national level, to approve our proposal on easing the management of the structural funds, because that could definitely help."
"Another issue raised concerned the administrative burden."
"This Thursday, the Commission will adopt a very far-reaching Communication on administrative burden reduction."
"That Communication will set out what has been achieved so far and what still remains to be done."
"It also builds on the important work done by the Stoiber Group."
"According to this particular report, the picture is very positive, and the proposal for how to deal with the administrative burden reduction is on the table."
"Unfortunately the majority of these proposals are pending before the Council, so again we hope that the European Parliament will help us to put pressure on the Member States to actually move forward on these issues."
"I would also like to say something about financial market supervision which has, of course, regularly appeared on the Commission agenda over recent months."
"A complete new supervisory framework must be set up at EU level, and we are pleased to see that some progress has been achieved."
"There is broad agreement in the Council on the Commission proposal on the Systemic Risk Board for macro-prudential supervision."
"We hope Parliament will give its support to this."
"Much more effort is needed when it comes to the supervisory authorities for micro-prudential supervision and, again, we count on the will of both Council and Parliament to arrive at an ambitious and efficient solution as soon as possible."
"Finally, let me say something about the topic which also features at the top of the Swedish Presidency's agenda, namely climate change, because we only have a few weeks to go to the Copenhagen conference."
"I think several of you have touched upon what will be the core issue which will determine success or failure."
"I would call it climate justice, because this is about the relation between developing and developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for the financing of both mitigation and adaptation measures and the way we also show our willingness to lead the way."
"The Commission - and it is the only body to have done this - has presented a proposal for financing."
"It has been criticised by many as not being enough."
"I am sure it will not be enough, but it is the first step, and hopefully it will also make the others come up with their own efforts and put something on the table that we will be able to negotiate in Copenhagen."
"We will, of course, continue to be fully active and not lower our level of ambition, but instead encourage all other parties and partners to take a full part and take a seat at the table - including the United States, for the first time - so that we can respond to all the concerns of citizens."
"I can assure you that we have no intention of lowering our ambitions, but instead will make sure that we work proactively for a good deal in Copenhagen."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - There is fevered speculation that Tony Blair may be appointed the first President of the European Union under the Lisbon Treaty/European Constitution."
"Nearly thirty-eight thousand people have signed a Europe-wide petition opposing his presidency."
"It is easy to understand why."
"As Prime Minister of Britain Mr Blair has shown himself to be a liar and a fantasist."
"On a relatively modest Prime Minister's salary, he has mysteriously managed to become a multi-millionaire."
"In the MPs expenses scandal now engulfing the House of Commons, only one MP's expense records have unaccountably gone missing."
"They are Mr Blair's."
"I share the revulsion of those opposed to Mr Blair's presidency."
"But who in fact would make a better presidential candidate than Mr Blair for this Union founded as it is on deceit, lies and corruption?"
"Mr Blair brought Britain to the edge of ruin."
"He could do the same for the EU."
"The EU and Tony Blair deserve each other."
"Mr President, we assume that the agenda of the forthcoming European Council will also include the economic crisis, in particular the situation with Opel."
"The acquisition of Opel and the massive national State aid promised in this connection is more than a test case for Europe; it is about the credibility of the European Commission, which must ensure that no unlawful State aid is granted."
"It is unacceptable for healthy, profitable plants to be closed because the Member State in which they are situated is unable to provide as much State aid as another - larger and more powerful - Member State."
"We must also learn lessons from the Opel affair: it is not yet too late to launch a coordinated European strategy for the automobile sector."
"CARS 21 was, and remains, a praiseworthy plan, but it is far from sufficient."
"Europe must produce a vigorous plan for the future that drastically accelerates the development of the sustainable electric car."
"To do so, we need to bring European car manufacturers together round the table, and to focus resources from the Seventh Framework Programme on this."
"It is time to creep out of our defensive position and to give all the workers in the largest industry in Europe a positive signal."
"One of the prime objectives of the next European Council will be to ensure the success of the UN Conference on climate change, which will take place in Copenhagen in December."
"The Council's conclusions on the EU's position in the Copenhagen conference are fundamental for ensuring that the EU speaks with one voice."
"It is important to keep an ambitious negotiating position."
"The EU should demonstrate that it is united and set an example of leadership, especially by helping developing countries, which will face costs of about EUR 100 billion per year from 2020 in order to adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce their emissions."
"Establishing the structure of a funding system for developing countries, particularly the least developed, is of paramount importance, along with defining the sources and amounts of this funding, so as to ensure an agreement in Copenhagen."
"This agreement will allow a protocol to come into force that will replace the Kyoto Protocol from 1 January 2013 and will ensure an effective reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, while allowing European industry to remain competitive in global markets."
"We are hoping that by the final October session of the European Council at the latest, the final obstacles will have disappeared preventing the Treaty of Lisbon from coming into force."
"This agreement may, in many respects, inspire the European Union to have a more efficient decision-making process."
"I would like to highlight one example: energy security."
"One sign of progress is that, unlike up until now, energy policy has been given a separate section in an EC Treaty."
"Based on the events of the last few years, I think that the new chapter will set out the guidelines in the EU's energy policy."
"The objectives to be supported include the development of energy efficiency, support for the use of renewable sources and the interconnection of networks."
"As an MEP from a new Member State, I am particularly pleased that the concept of solidarity also features in the new energy chapter."
"However, the Treaty of Lisbon does not in any way, at least when it comes to energy policy, present us with a ready-made solution."
"The inclusion of the new chapter acts much more as a warning: Europe needs to take urgent steps to reduce its dependency and promote its environmental views."
"The Treaty of Lisbon in itself offers absolutely no guarantee, just an opportunity."
"This is an opportunity for Member States to consolidate the foundations of a common EU energy policy, while being aware of their own interests."
"The development of alternative supply routes, the interconnection of networks or even the provision of protection against external purchases cannot be conceived in the future without a suitable degree of political determination and cooperation from Member States."
"The impact of Ireland's approval of the Treaty of Lisbon is making itself felt across the whole European continent."
"The purpose of this Treaty is obviously to simplify the decision-making process after the EU's expansion towards the east."
"Against this background, the message conveyed by our partners in Ireland is in support of solidarity among Europe's citizens."
"We are also talking about one of the last European Councils to be held under the EU's rotating presidency system."
"This fact is all the more significant in that the selection has to take place of the occupants of the main posts that will be held in the coming years."
"This is an issue which has triggered lively debates, involving countless political sensitivities."
"In my opinion, our task is to deal with an issue where clear-cut principles must take priority over any feelings of pride of the moment."
"It is our duty to offer the European Union consistency, efficiency, a long-term future and balanced development for all regions so that it can face up to the challenges on the global political stage, whether we are talking about the economic crisis, climate change, our common identity, etc. Indeed, the European Union will acquire the strength it deserves only when we are on the same wavelength at a global level and when we can be identified as an entity that takes united action."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes)"
"1."
"Freedom of information in Italy and other Member States of the European Union (vote)"
"(PT) Mr President, I would like to ask for the floor under Rule 157(1) of the Rules of Procedure in order to speak about the second draft amendment, presented by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), to the joint motion for a resolution on freedom of information in Italy and other Member States."
"This proposed amendment brings shame on the European Parliament and, in the name of the truth, it should not be debated, still less voted upon."
"Its premises are false and are based on a mere fallacy dreamed up by Portuguese political parties during the electoral campaign."
"They were given the correct response by Portuguese voters."
"However, an unquestionable truth (and I have the evidence here to prove it) is that the MEP who has tabled this amendment showed his intolerance and inquisitorial mindset yesterday on his website, by calling for the writer José Saramago, the Nobel Prize-winner for literature, to renounce his Portuguese nationality."
"It seems pretty clear who is attacking freedom of opinion."
"Mr President, in accordance with Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to remind you that, in the debate on human rights in the world in 2007, this House decided not to do as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) proposed and make reference to persons who represent high civil or religious institutions for the purposes of strengthening political arguments."
"We therefore ask you to adopt the same measure with regard to the amendments to our resolution tabled by the PPE Group, which make explicit reference to the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano."
"Mr Sassoli, you raised the issue of inadmissibility, under Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure."
"As a result, the Presidency, namely President Buzek, has examined this matter in depth, as you can imagine."
"He has based his analysis on the following principles."
"First of all, the amendments to which you refer, namely Amendments 7, 8 and 9, are directly related to the text which they intend to modify."
"Secondly, they do not aim to delete or replace the entire text."
"Neither do they alter various paragraphs in the text nor can it be claimed that they do not affect all the language versions."
"Therefore, in strict application of the provisions of Rule 147, the President is of the opinion that they fulfil all the relevant admissibility criteria."
"Thus, the President has decided that they are admissible."
"With respect to the reference to President Napolitano, who is a former, much-loved colleague, there is a precedent which allows us to include the names of people, of politicians, in our texts."
"Mr Sassoli, if you wish to proceed with your request, there are, of course, other courses of action open to you, under the Rules of Procedure, such as an oral amendment or, of course, a vote against the above-mentioned amendments."
"Mr President, I fully agree with the Presidency's interpretation regarding the amendments."
"I have an oral amendment, therefore we will keep all of the amendments and propose that we simply delete the name and surname of the President of the Italian Republic."
"Therefore, in accordance with our standard practice, my proposal is not to include the reference to individuals and to delete 'Giorgio Napolitano', leaving the amendments and the option to vote on those amendments."
"I feel that this will enable us to convey in some way the sense of respect that we have for the President of the Italian Republic, who clearly said what he said and who was referred to in the debate by all of the speakers from all of the political groups."
"Mr President, having noted the Presidency's decision on the admissibility of these amendments, I would simply ask the authors of these amendments to withdraw them for the sake of political expediency."
"I do not believe that failing to mention the name and surname of the President of the Italian Republic will change a great deal, given that it is the President of the Italian Republic who is the subject of these amendments."
"I think this is something of a ritual where our work is concerned;"
"I have never seen MEPs from other countries cite the Queen of England or the President of Germany in our resolutions for what may appear to be exploitative reasons."
"Therefore, I would simply ask that Amendments 7, 8 and 9 to the resolution be withdrawn."
"Mr Sassoli, given that you asked this question, and that Mr Mauro has put forward a proposal in response to yours, would you like to take the floor, in order to reply?"
"Mr President, we are in favour of deleting the name and surname of our Italian President."
"Naturally, we will vote against those amendments."
"In that case, we will withdraw the name and surname of the Italian Head of State."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 3:"
"(PT) Mr President, my oral amendment is as follows: regrets and deplores the influence wielded by the Portuguese Socialist Government, which has led to the decision to terminate the programme Jornal Nacional on the Portuguese television channel TV1, and notes that this decision is now under investigation by the Portuguese Regulatory Authority."
"Mr President, I would like to remind the House that the European Parliament should not accept resolutions which apply double standards."
"This is why I am quoting an example from my country - from Hungary - where the Finance Minister filed criminal proceedings against a journalist because he did not like what he was writing about him."
"This is why I think that mentioning the Italian Prime Minister in your text filing lawsuits against Italian and European newspapers and not mentioning this case - I think what happened in Hungary is more serious - applies a double standard."
"So I would call on our colleagues on the Left here not to vote against this amendment because that would only demonstrate and make clear that your activity is nothing but a show - a show bullying the Prime Minister of a country where there is no Left."
"(Applause)"
"The Government is not from your family, but you do not accept the same standards when there is a Socialist government."
"So the amendment follows along the right lines."
"(Applause)"
"'whereas the European Parliament shall not accept double standards; whereas, in order to put political pressure on journalists disclosing corruption cases linked to high-ranking officials and ruling party politicians, the Government administration in Hungary has recently introduced steps to launch criminal proceedings against such members of the media;' - namely Mr Tamás Pindroch, the journalist from the Magyar Hírlap - 'whereas bearing in mind in particular that criminal proceedings were launched against the journalist who was investigating the scandals of a high-ranking former member of the government and one of the candidates for European Commissioner; whereas this has resulted in an atmosphere where the press is under political pressure in Hungary'."
"I ask you to support this amendment in order to keep your credibility."
"It might make it clear that you are not bullying a particular person whom you do not like and who does not share your political views, but you really are supporting the freedom of the press in Europe."
"(The oral amendment was not accepted)"
"That concludes the vote."
"(IT) Mr President, I have taken the floor to inform you of a very serious event, which has nothing to do with this vote and on which I call on the Presidency of Parliament to obtain information as quickly as possible, so that we may take action to defend our prerogatives and immunities."
"This morning, officers from the Italian police force forced their way into the private residence of a Member of our delegation, while he was here in Strasbourg."
"He therefore had to hurriedly leave Strasbourg to return to his residence on the order of the Italian courts, which ordered the search of an MEP, that is to say of the private residence of an MEP, in clear breach of the fundamental aspects of our prerogatives and immunities."
"I am simply asking for Parliament and the Presidency to verify whether the initiative taken by the courts and the Italian police force with regard to Mr Mastella constitutes a disrespectful act and an extreme violation of the terms of our immunity."
"The Presidency will address this issue in order to unequivocally defend our privileges and immunity."
"Mr President, I hope that a previous unfortunate vote on a Lithuanian law that has yet to come into being has helped many colleagues understand the danger, which has to be prevented, of the European Union turning into the Soviet Union."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(ES) Mr President, I hope that Mr Berlusconi will be prosecuted by the judicial authorities for the crimes he has committed, and that his domination of the press will end."
"Certain MEPs, who did not vote in favour of the conviction, should stop turning a blind eye, as what is happening in Italy, with respect to freedom, is a very serious matter."
"It affects and concerns all Europeans, whatever the outcome of the vote today."
"(LT) I voted for the resolution drafted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats together with other groups, because freedom of information, freedom of expression and diversity of opinion must be ensured in all of the Member States of the European Union."
"Freedom of information is the foundation of a free democratic society and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is laid down that every person has the right to freedom of expression, and this right includes the right to have one's own convictions and to obtain and distribute information and ideas without the interference of government institutions."
"Therefore we, Members of the European Parliament, must support the development of independent media and fair competition at national level."
"In order to ensure effective freedom of the press, government institutions must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and to foster its development, which is the most important thing ensuring the fundamental values and rights of the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, 'what a caterpillar calls the end of the world, the entire world calls a butterfly'."
"That thought by a Chinese philosopher is of relevance in this debate, if we consider that President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize despite attacking the hostile television coverage he received, and here we are discussing allegations of a lack of freedom that are motivated by one thing only: the culture of hatred against Mr Berlusconi."
"The culture of hatred, as demonstrated by that photomontage of the Prime Minister behind bars at the street demonstration on press freedom, where red flags and insults of all kinds prevailed."
"The culture of hatred for which this Parliament must assume responsibility if it is to prevent the disgraceful anti-democratic attack of a Jacobin left."
"It may be that Europe, which has always struggled to tolerate a strong and decisive Italy, is pretending to be unaware of all this in order to downsize Italy's power."
"The Italian people will not allow this; they will not allow devious European powers to try to rationalise Italy due to the culture of hatred of those in Italy who merely want to overturn the centre-right's democratic electoral win."
"Of the newspapers with the highest readership figures in Italy, 18 are against or are not aligned with the government, and only five can be ascribed to the centre-right, and we hear all kinds of insults."
"That is the truth, and in the interests of democracy, it is time that this House talked about an Italian left that is anti-democratic and addicted to the culture of hatred."
"(HU) Let us send a message to those liars in Hungary who claim that Jobbik has and can have no place in the European Parliament, saying that the votes of the three-member Hungarian Jobbik delegation determined that Italy could not be condemned here today by the unjust, discriminatory forces present."
"This is the first thing I wish to say."
"Secondly, we did not do this based on political group discipline, but according to the benchmark of justice."
"We also took into account, first of all, that they would have tried to use double standards."
"Indeed, I complained to Mr Barroso yesterday that in Hungary the socialist-liberal government had violated the freedom of opinion, not through the concentration of press or media, but by shooting people in the eye, putting them in prison, torturing them in prison and conducting a series of sham trials."
"Mr Barroso said in response to this that it was an internal matter."
"How can this be an internal matter, when the case in Italy is not an internal matter?"
"Jobbik will not allow such double standards to be applied in Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, Europe, too, has noticed that the Italian opposition has become delirious, imagining things that do not exist."
"Of course, we cannot rejoice at this because we would have preferred to have come to Parliament and talked about the real problems for which people are asking us for solutions, but we can take comfort in the fact that at least Europe has given a verdict that not even Antonio Di Pietro will be able to question."
"In fact, this already happened in 2004, with the central figure again being Mr Di Pietro, supported by other Members, and now he has sent the others here to do the same thing, but there has been no kind of rejoicing on the part of this movement."
"Moreover, the Italian electorate wanted to remove communists from the parliamentary arena, and they no longer sit on these benches."
"Freedom of the press in Italy is nothing more than an attempt by publishing groups, magistrates and politicians to delegitimise the Prime Minister and his government."
"However, this gives rise to a situation where manhunts exist and where only one man is targeted obsessively, and to a civil war that, fuelled by a certain left-wing element, may result in very serious consequences."
"(ET) There are several ways to destroy media pluralism and feed biased information to the population, and to prevent diversity of opinions."
"One possibility is to monopolise the media economically through ownership, but this is not the only one."
"Monopoly of information can be achieved, for example, by filling appointments in leading public media bodies with members of a single party - that is, with members of the ruling party - and by blocking other opinions."
"There are other examples, and we in this Chamber have heard about them in the course of the discussion on this subject."
"Those were probably facts."
"All of this gives evidence of the fact that if Europe wants to be democratic, it needs rules, it needs directives in order to create media pluralism."
"For this reason, I supported the resolution put forward by ALDE, the socialists and the greens, which makes proposals of exactly this type."
"(IT) Mr President, first of all I wish to correct my first and second votes - I meant to abstain, but I made a mistake because I acted in haste and pressed the wrong button."
"My first two votes are abstentions from the whole day's votes."
"The statement I am making is this: there is a grave original sin in the proposal that has led to today's debate and it is a sin that has already been pointed out by the President of the Italian Republic."
"Added to this sin is the opportunism of choosing the Italian Prime Minister's legal action against certain newspapers - a process that is clearly in full compliance with the rule of law - as a means by which to attack him."
"Therefore, we have not voted for the proposal by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, and so on, but nor have we voted for the motion by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because, although it deserves recognition insofar as it safeguards Italy's dignity, it totally overlooks the problem of the balance between the media and the other state powers, which exists in Europe and which is a serious problem in Italy too."
"This does not just concern the Italian Prime Minister's conflict of interests in this area; it concerns other problems too."
"At national level, on the other hand, my party, the UDC, is continually challenging the majority on this."
"I believe that we, too, must send out a message of support by abstaining."
"(IT) Mr President, this debate has shown us how the Italian left is increasingly far removed from the sentiments shared by our people."
"There has not been an uprising among Italians; there has been a political manoeuvre by a judicial, publishing and political elite to invalidate a verdict legitimately delivered by the people a few months ago."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those who have said in this House in the last few days that Italians are concerned about press freedom being threatened by Mr Berlusconi are lying, and they know it."
"All honest Italians recognise that in Italy, there are newspapers, radio stations and TV channels that operate freely; that many of those newspapers have an editorial policy that is opposed to that of the Italian Prime Minister; that if there is a lack of pluralism it is within the only - and I stress the only, ladies and gentlemen - trade union recognised by Italian journalists, which is shamelessly biased towards the left; and that programme makers, commentators and comedians whose views conflict with those of the Italian Prime Minister can easily find jobs and work within state-run television channels or within television channels owned by the Italian Prime Minister, without their freedom being threatened."
"If Italians do have some worries and fears, then, like those of all Europeans, Mr President, they concern the crisis, illegal immigration, jobs and pensions, but certainly not freedom of information, which has never been under threat and which, on the contrary, is under attack every day from the partisanship of the left."
"Mr President, I will quote John Stuart Mill and then I will continue in Swedish."
"'If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.'"
"(SV) Italy is part of the European cradle of democracy."
"It is therefore regrettable that the Italian media is in the situation it is in today."
"Respect for fundamental human rights in all countries in Europe is the heart of EU cooperation."
"It is totally wrong to claim, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is doing, that this is not the case."
"The PPE Group is hiding behind these arguments and in so doing, is serving the cause of Silvio Berlusconi."
"Diversity in the media involves many different players having the opportunity to operate without the State interfering in their content."
"In order for us to have a vibrant democratic debate in Europe, we need independent media in all Member States."
"How this is achieved is not a matter for the EU."
"Ensuring the freedom of the press, on the other hand, actually is a matter that should be dealt with at EU level."
"I therefore regret the result of today's vote on the resolution on the freedom of the media in Italy."
"(NL) Mr President, I am not impressed by Mr Berlusconi's political and moral leadership and, unfortunately, Italy is not top of the list of countries when it comes to freedom of the press."
"However, freedom of information and of the press is primarily a matter for Italy itself."
"The Italians themselves must take action on this."
"Fortunately, they are indeed doing so, for example, by lifting the immunity of the Italian Prime Minister."
"In addition, the recent launch of the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano shows that there is a critical press in Italy and that it has room to manoeuvre."
"Therefore, I call on the Italians themselves to remain vigilant for any attacks on freedom of the press in their country."
"I hope it is not necessary for the Brussels bureaucracy to interfere in this."
"After all, we do not want 'more Europe' but rather a Europe that focuses on its core tasks."
"Only then can Europe gain the confidence of the electorate."
"(FI) Mr President, freedom of information is a very important issue and, for my part, I voted in favour of it."
"We must remember, however, that freedom also entails responsibility, and we in Europe need critical and transparent communications."
"We need to ensure that this is also the case in the future."
"European history shows what sort of horrors have resulted when the media has been closed off and information has not been allowed to flow freely."
"On this matter, I think that we in the European Parliament need to look at the whole of Europe, and not just at an individual Member State."
"That is why we need to extend the issue and establish principles that we adhere to, whether it is socialists, liberals or the right who are in power."
"The same rules have to apply to everyone and in all cases, we must act to ensure that freedom of information will be preserved."
"That is one of the fundamental freedoms that I hope the European Union will also preserve in the years to come."
"I also hope that everyone will be treated according to the same standards."
"Mr President, the European Union claims to embrace fine principles about freedom and democracy, and they are all restated and reinforced in the Lisbon Treaty, but time and again we turn a blind eye to blatant transgressions taking place in one Member State or another."
"We do not point the finger at those who fail to support the principles upon which the European Union is based."
"We do not like to rock the boat, but we had the chance today to take a stand and to say that control of the press by the Italian Prime Minister is a clear abuse."
"There are problems in other Member States, but in Italy it is at its worst."
"Thanks to the votes of the UK Independence Party and the British Conservatives, we lost today by one vote: there was one vote in it."
"The Conservatives in Britain say they want to repatriate social and employment policy from the European Union."
"They do not say that they also want to prevent the European Union having any role whatsoever in standing up for the basic freedoms that support democracy across Europe."
"(NL) Mr President, I, too, am delighted that the resolution has been voted down, as it is unacceptable for this House to be misused to conduct a political witch-hunt against a specific politician."
"It is equally unacceptable for this House to style itself a kind of European Big Brother on this, an inquisitor-general who directly interferes in an issue that is purely and simply a matter for the individual Member States."
"Those striking out here at a supposed threat to freedom of information in Italy, a threat that is wholly imaginary, are the first to advocate muzzling laws purely and simply aimed at the political elimination of dissidents."
"This left-wing hypocrisy is abhorrent."
"Indeed, if there were even half as much freedom of information in Belgium as there is in Italy, we would already have made considerable progress."
"Mr President, it reflects no credit on this House that the whole of our agenda today, the whole of our vote, should have been taken up with a matter that ought never to have come to the floor."
"It lies beyond the purview of this Parliament and is within the prerogatives of one of our Member States."
"I hold no particular brief for Silvio Berlusconi."
"I am delighted that the British Conservatives no longer sit with his party in the European People's Party, but I cannot have been alone in being put off by the Pharisaical self-righteousness that we have heard from the other side during this debate."
"They complained about Mr Berlusconi having immunity from prosecution without mentioning that they, as MEPs, have a similar immunity."
"They complain about his domination of the media, without mentioning the tens of millions of euros of public money that this Parliament spends on promoting itself."
"This resolution, and the fact that it came before us at all today, reflects no credit on anyone - no credit on the Italians, who took to this Chamber an argument that they had lost in their own nation state, and no credit on the rest of us for presuming to get involved."
"Such issues ought to be properly determined through the national democratic mechanisms and procedures of the Italian Republic."
"Let me repeat my call for the Lisbon Treaty to be put to a vote."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"Mr President, I think all of us in this Chamber are concerned about media pluralism."
"We all want to see greater media pluralism right across the EU."
"I have concerns about media pluralism in a number of Member States."
"I have concerns about media pluralism in a number of countries outside the EU, but about which the Socialists often never raise this issue, for example, Cuba and North Korea."
"The Socialists keep rather quiet about media pluralism in these countries."
"But there is a very important principle here."
"The Rolling Stones once said 'You can't always get what you want', and when you can't get what you what, what you do is rely on the democratic process in your country to persuade the people to remove the government you do not support."
"You do not decide to go to the European Parliament and try to get democratic decisions overturned there."
"This is a principle that the Conservatives hold dear, and this is why I am proud that the European Conservative and Reformist Group played its part in voting down this despicable resolution."
"(IT) Mr President, I believe that this Parliament's democratic vote has unquestionably demonstrated something that everyone knows to be true, namely that there is freedom of information in Italy."
"You see, what the left were trying to do was to look for topics to raise objections about - why?"
"Because, as I already said in Brussels, they have so many newspapers in Italy, but they do not know what to write, and so the only thing that they could say - delaying this Parliament's work for a month in the process - was that they support the notion that there is no freedom of information in Italy."
"In their many newspapers, they cannot write that, in Italy, a government has moved the earthquake victims of Aquila out of the tent cities and back into proper houses in the space of four months; in their newspapers they cannot write that, in three months, a new Berlusconi-led government in Italy has removed the rubbish from the streets of Naples that they had allowed to build up for years; they cannot say that, according to the OECD, Italy is the country in which there have been the fewest job losses, despite the economic crisis; they cannot write in their newspapers that, in Italy, no banks have collapsed and no savers have lost their money, despite the economic crisis; they cannot say it, no one reads them, no one believes them, and they lay the blame on the alleged lack of freedom of information."
"Do you know what we say in Italy?"
"We say that they are like those who have opened the ring, let the bulls escape and are looking for the horns: they have lost the bulls, the votes, the numbers in Italy; they tried - I shall finish here, Mr President - to recover them in Europe, where they also had a majority, but where they also lost that majority."
"With all due respect to those in Europe who wanted to demonstrate that the opposite is true, democracy has shown once again that freedom of information is alive and well in Italy."
"Mr President, I am very pleased with the outcome of today's resolution because Italy is a Member State of the European Union and to include it individually in a motion before us would be somewhat superfluous."
"However, I hope that in the future, we have an opportunity to discuss freedom of information, freedom of the press, and the freedom of individual journalists, within the organs they work for, to express their opinions."
"And we should ensure that this applies right across the European Union, as we should not be discussing only one particular country."
"Today's result was a good day for the European Union and a good day for democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, as usual, we find ourselves discussing and voting on issues exclusively of national interest and relevance in the European Parliament, and thus not in the Italian Chamber of Deputies or in the Italian Senate."
"Once again, after the immigration-related accusations made against the Italian Government in this House by those who are on the opposition not because of a strange conspiracy that they see themselves as the victims of, but because of the sovereign will of the people, an opportunistic, ridiculous and self-serving attempt has been made to distort the reality of the situation in Italy, with the sole aim being to denigrate the government and our country in the person of our Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi."
"Minority parties have tried to gain the upper hand in the elections with a one-sided publicity campaign, compensating for the lack of ideology and content in their political programmes with a campaign designed to cause systematic damage to our country within Europe."
"Those MEPs who have supported the Italian opposition should focus on issues that strictly concern their own countries, without looking at the Italian situation through the deluded and deluding eyes of my fellow countrymen."
"They belong to a party that has distinguished itself over the years by having a policy that consists of just one thing: the systematic and targeted abuse of the Italian Prime Minister, the leader of a coalition that was democratically elected by 17 million Italians."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on freedom of information because I believe that press freedom is one of the pillars of the free and democratic society which I support, and whenever it is at risk, as in Italy at present, we must be ready to protect it."
"In Italy, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are clearly at serious risk."
"The fact that the Prime Minister controls, whether directly or indirectly, a vast empire of publishing houses, daily and weekly newspapers and three television channels is clearly incompatible with the political office occupied by Mr Berlusconi and with the requirements of a democratic state and a member of the EU."
"Added to this are the attempts to pressurise and manipulate the public television station."
"We should not forget that the current economic crisis has further weakened the media, making them more susceptible to pressure from advertising companies or public institutions."
"It is imperative that the European Commission finally issues a proposal for a directive on pluralism and concentration of the media, clarifying the rules to be followed in all Member States on this issue, which is so vital for democracy."
"I voted in favour of changing the title of the draft resolution on freedom of information in Italy, following the European Commission's statement of 8 October 2009, to delete the word 'Italy'."
"Even if the situation in Italy is extremely worrying due to a continuing conflict of interest between the ownership and/or control of the public or private media and some political powers, I share the opinion of many colleagues that the European Parliament should not point the finger at one or other Member State."
"in writing. - Today we voted on a variety of resolutions and amendments."
"In essence, there were proposals before us which condemned the running of media services in Germany, Portugal, Hungary and Italy."
"As members of the leading party in the Irish Government, we have consistently opposed proposals put forward in the European Parliament which condemn the internal activities of individual governments and individual countries within the European Union."
"We have consistently opposed political strategies since we joined the European Union whereby the European Parliament is asked to adjudicate on political divisions and arguments that take place internally within individual countries in the European Union."
"That has been our policy stance in the past and that is our policy position now."
"We have always been consistent."
"We will always uphold the freedom of expression, which is a fundamental right of all citizens in Europe."
"The surprising result of this vote will hopefully create scope for a real debate, a debate on the substance of the problems threatening media pluralism in Europe."
"We wholeheartedly support such a debate."
"We all know that freedom of the media is under pressure in several Member States (see the most recent Press Freedom Index report, published yesterday by Reporters Without Borders)."
"However, it is essential that we take a fundamental approach to these problems and develop an instrument to improve the situation throughout the EU, so that journalists are able to do their jobs without pressure from private or political stakeholders."
"Some Members of this House preferred to take a national tack and settle domestic national accounts, but it is good that that strategy failed, as it would have risked nipping the debate in the bud."
"We must now move away from these national games once and for all and invest our energy in structural solutions to a problem that, in the longer term, constitutes a real threat to our rule of law and to democracy in Europe."
"in writing. - The notion of there being any form of breach of the right to information in Italy is erroneous."
"Firstly, it is not the case that the European Parliament should be used as the forum in which to discuss matters that should remain within the internal competence of the domestic courts and parliaments of Member States."
"In addition, it is clear that the recent criticism of Italy was only initiated in an effort to attack the Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi."
"Hence, I have voted against the resolution."
"The relationship between political power and journalism is a complex and delicate one, but it is clear to me that no one should have the right to impose his/her own 'truth', censuring ideas, persecuting journalists or limiting freedom of expression and information."
"The freedom of information and expression is one of the basic principles which underpin the European Union, and it is essential in any democracy."
"This also means that we should not trivialise this debate or use it for political gain."
"In submitting a resolution on freedom of information in Italy, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are confusing the European Parliament with the Italian Parliament."
"They show that they have double standards when they refuse the proposal to include cases from other countries, such as Germany, Hungary or Portugal, where the unjustifiable cancellation of Jornal Nacional on TV1 was mentioned."
"They are not interested in freedom of information in Europe, but only in Italy..."
"Intriguingly, on this very day, we learn that Portugal has fallen 14 points in the rankings of press freedom published by Reporters without Borders."
"Freedom of the press is essential in a democratic society."
"Consequently, I believe that the need for a balanced media market must be supported by all Member States, which must commit themselves, both individually and jointly, to providing European citizens with the opportunity of obtaining the most accurate information possible."
"I believe that it is absolutely necessary for all European citizens to exercise actively their rights and obligations so that they are properly informed, but can also understand and criticise the way in which they are informed by the European institutions, as well as by every Member State individually."
"As an ex-journalist, I abstained from all the proposals and amendments put to the vote this Wednesday."
"I wish to thereby express my strong criticism of the use for party political purposes of a debate as fundamental as freedom of the press, a fundamental right which, in essence, should not, under any circumstances, be the subject of political horse-trading and battles between the left-wing and the right-wing!"
"Italy is experiencing attacks on the freedom of the press and this is totally unacceptable."
"However, have we heard from Bulgarian, Romanian or French journalists as well?"
"Have we examined closely the political or economic interference that exists in other countries in the EU?"
"How can we be sure that politics in our own countries is not interfering in editorial control and content?"
"If we had extended our study with a new report, we could have supported our resolutions so that they hit, in the most appropriate way, their real target: freedom of the press in the European Union!"
"I think that this fundamental right deserves more investment than what has emerged in these texts - texts which have all missed the point."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which calls for a directive on media concentration and the protection of media pluralism."
"Unfortunately, the EU's legislative framework on media pluralism and media concentration is still inadequate."
"The European Union guarantees freedom of expression and information in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Indeed, Article 11 of the Charter explicitly states that 'the freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected' Media Freedom and pluralism are essential to a free, healthy and democratic society."
"The increasing concentration of media in the hands of wealthy patrons clearly stifles open debate."
"We need be very wary of wealthy business interests controlling the flow of information and pushing a self serving market driven, anti-regulation, and, often, anti-Trade Union agenda."
"Equally, and for the same reasons of ensuring impartiality, public media operators should be independent and not subject to interference by governmental authorities."
"The European Parliament is once more called upon to give an opinion on a national issue, that is, the threats to freedom of expression in Italy."
"The Luxembourg members of the PPE group are of the opinion that, as a matter of principle, the European Parliament should not interfere in a conflict of interest, genuine or not, in a Member State."
"Parliament should not demand European legislative measures each time a political or legal issue cannot be resolved satisfactorily in the eyes of all the parties concerned in a given Member State."
"This is why we have voted against any attempt to legislate at the European level on a problem of conflicting interests in a specific Member State."
"This being the case, we are in favour of a genuine European debate on the press and the problematic mergers that can exist in this area."
"This debate should not focus on one specific Member State but address the issue in an objective and consistent way for the whole of the EU, so that the solutions to these problems can be based on existing Community legislation."
"The Portuguese Socialist delegation in the European Parliament denounces and condemns the actions of certain Portuguese MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who have tried to tarnish the image of Portugal and the Portuguese Prime Minister with the unfounded accusation of interference in the media."
"This was carried out as part of a campaign to whitewash the attacks by Silvio Berlusconi's Italian Government on freedom of expression and the media."
"The Socialist delegation cannot but express its regret that certain Portuguese MEPs are dragging this debate, which was instigated by certain parties during the recent electoral campaign, and one to which the Portuguese electorate gave a resounding answer, onto the international stage."
"Unlike those behind this campaign, the Socialists are not asking any Portuguese citizens to renounce their nationality, but we do denounce those who attack the good reputation of Portugal so as to fulfil possible commitments to Silvio Berlusconi."
"Commissioner Viviane Reding has made an appeal to the Chamber for when it debates this issue, asking us not to use the European institutions to resolve problems that should be resolved at national level, as set out in our Treaties."
"I could not agree more, and I deplore the use of such tactics by the European left, particularly the Socialists."
"I recall that, during the previous term, the Spanish Socialists sought to manipulate the European Parliament by gaining outside support - which was scarce in their own country - for a disastrous anti-terrorist policy."
"This unfortunate pattern of behaviour persists."
"As the Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has complained, these attitudes are rife with bad faith and do nothing to build public confidence in the European institutions."
"I wonder whether the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would be as eager to hold a similar debate about Portugal and its government's repeated interference in the media, which, within a few months, led to the replacement of the editor-in-chief of a noted newspaper (O Público) and the sudden termination of a television news programme (TV1), which has already been roundly condemned by the regulatory authority for the media."
"We voted in favour of the resolution in defence of freedom of information because we believe in defending the freedom of expression and information, and pluralism rather than concentration in the media."
"Nevertheless, we disagree with certain aspects of this resolution which verge on interference in the democratic life of the individual countries, and we have major doubts about a possible directive on this matter, especially given the current composition of the European Parliament."
"Our struggle for freedom of information and expression, the rights of journalists and other media professionals, for universal access to information and guaranteed pluralism in the media cannot be used to provide cover for partisan schemes whose prime objective is the European Parliament's interference in countries' internal affairs, through the use of double standards, depending on which political entity has an interest in a particular issue."
"Therefore, we have also abstained from voting on the proposals of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on issues relating to TV1 in Portugal, although the Portuguese Communist Party is known to be critical of this situation in Portugal."
"I regard the debate on the freedom of the press as very important."
"The situation in Italy is worrying, but it is the task of this European Parliament to debate the subject in general or for all countries which pose a problem in this area."
"To only mention Italy while knowing that problems also exist in other countries, for example, Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal and Hungary, creates a partisan debate which does not contribute to freedom of expression and of the press."
"I voted today against the joint resolution proposed by the PPE, the ECR and the EFD on freedom of information in Italy and other Member States, as well as against the amendments tabled by these groups to the joint resolution proposed by the left and the united centre, since they were essentially aimed at stripping the Italian Prime Minister of his responsibilities to comply with the principle of pluralism that is a fundamental value of our democracies."
"They also scandalously attacked the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano."
"I strongly supported the joint resolution co-signed by my group, because I fundamentally support freedom of expression and am in favour of European legislation on media mergers, despite the opposition of the right, which has already been demonstrated several times."
"We should note the fears coming from Italy following the recent pressure exerted by Silvio Berlusconi on the Italian and European newspapers, as well as on the European Commission's freedom of expression regarding the Italian authorities' diversion of migrants at sea to Libya, in violation of the principle of non-refoulement."
"I voted against the draft resolution because it is harmful and does not comply with European standards."
"In the name of certain particular interests, the Left has infringed, among others, the principle of the application of uniform standards to all Member States."
"The prevention of a vote on the oral amendment moved by Mr Szájer provides abundant proof that the true objective of the resolution was not to show concern for freedom of the media."
"The real objective of the resolution was the desire to attack the Italian Government, and only the Italian Government."
"This is because that government is disliked by the Left."
"The Left is free to dislike the Italian Government."
"I do not see any reason, however, to go along with this attempt at treating the European Parliament as a tool, and with this attempt at involving our Chamber in an ongoing political fight within a Member State."
"Freedom of the media is also universal and important when it is under threat from Left-wing governments."
"I am very glad that we have rejected the draft, which was only on the order of business so that the Left could attack its political opponents in Italy."
"Mr President, freedom of expression and an independent media are the cornerstone of democracy and they have to be valued highly and protected."
"Like many others here, I am worried about the developments we have witnessed in some Member States, including Italy and Hungary."
"If this resolution had dealt with communication and its problems throughout the EU generally, I would also have warmly supported it."
"This time I could not do so."
"I support the principle expressed by our group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that the EU should not interfere in any national affairs for which it has no legal mandate to do so."
"I am therefore satisfied with the result of the vote on freedom of information in Italy and that all nine motions for resolutions were rejected in plenary today."
"I share my group's concern that, with its demands for Europe-wide legislation on media pluralism and ownership, Parliament would be doing more to destroy freedom of the press than to establish it."
"The Member States of the EU each have their own proper institutions to find a solution to fundamental problems, and this problem of Italy's must also be solved at national level."
"That, however, does not mean that we should deny that the problem exists at all."
"I myself voted in line with my group's position on the joint motion for a resolution by the socialists, liberals and greens, except on one issue."
"Our group's Amendment 10 underestimates, or actually rejects, the problems of freedom of information in Italy, and so I could not support it."
"Logic also prevented me from supporting our group's own motion for a resolution, as it too yielded to the temptation to deal with a situation in just one Member State, and by way of striking a balance, it sought to underrate the problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is it in Italy that the head of state threatens, takes legal action at the slightest criticism and becomes personally involved in a court case to kill a political opponent?"
"Is it in Italy that the party in power treats the slightest non-sycophantic information as 'vileness', as an 'absolutely unprecedented campaign of violence', as a deliberate attempt to 'trip up' the Head of State?"
"Is it in Italy that the press is criticised when it spreads the news of affairs like nepotism benefiting the Head of State's kid?"
"Is it only in Italy that those in power have special links with the executives of the large private television channels and appoint the heads of the public channels?"
"Is it in Italy that we change the law on audiovisual advertising in favour of our friends?"
"Is it in Italy that a minister is invited onto a major television news programme to confess to having engaged in sex tourism, an act criminally punishable, except in this minister's case?"
"No, this is in France!"
"It astonishes me that the French socialists, communists and greens in this Chamber do not think it is worth using this debate to denounce the dubious practices of 'sarkozia'!"
"in writing. - I voted against the resolution on the freedom of information in Italy and in other EU Member States mainly due to paragraph D mentioning the 'critical situation in Romania and Bulgaria', quoting a Freedom House report."
"I have carefully read this report, especially the section related to my country, and therefore I can say that this sentence is not true."
"The quoted report clearly says that 'The Romanian constitution protects freedom of the press and the government has become increasingly respectful of these rights'."
"Relating to the President of Romania, Mr Traian Băsescu, the report states that 'he has proven to be less controlling and manipulative of the media than his predecessors.'"
"Another strong argument to prove our freedom of expression is that 'Romania is considered a regional leader in high-speed broadband connections'."
"Through the Internet, all journalists can express themselves freely and get in touch with the public."
"I therefore think that the reference to Romania and Bulgaria was used without taking into consideration the entire context."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution, and strongly support calls to prevent media monopolies operating in Europe."
"Freedom of information is a hugely important issue, and given the strength of feeling and close vote, I hope it is an issue we will return to."
"I was disappointed that after the amendments were rejected, we were unable to pass the final resolution."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted against Resolution RC7 0088/2009 tabled by the Right, and in favour of the joint resolution RC7 0090/2009 tabled by the remainder of the Groups in the House, because I defend freedom of expression and information, as well as media pluralism, and because I am concerned by the situation in Italy, where there is a conflict of interest between the political, economic and media powers, as well as worrying media concentration, involving both public and privately-owned media."
"The situation in Italy constitutes a serious attack on media pluralism and, in this respect, the actions of the right-wing government, led by Mr Berlusconi, have been unacceptable."
"I think that it is right to remedy this anomalous situation, which could have serious repercussions for the whole of the European Union, and take steps to guarantee the independence of the public media channels and protect them from any kind of governmental interference."
"I wanted my vote to explicitly reflect my disapproval of the Italian authorities placing any pressure on European national newspapers or intimidating them."
"Today's votes on the motions for resolutions are based on a debate which takes some beating in terms of its political one-sidedness."
"The United Left has launched an attack on Berlusconi and taken its revenge on him."
"It is true that there is a high media concentration in Italy, but the threats to freedom of speech and democracy have been exaggerated."
"It is obvious that they will oppose everything which is not on the left."
"In the joint motion for a resolution, the Greens, the Social Democrats, the Communists and the Liberals have asked for the EU to be given the authority to monitor pluralism of the media, as it is euphemistically called."
"I strongly reject this, because the authority in this area must lie exclusively with the Member States."
"I felt that I had to speak out against these party-political attempts to intervene and that I had to vote against the joint motion for a resolution put forward by the left, because for me and for the Freedom Party of Austria, freedom of the media and freedom of speech are among the most important aspects of democracy and they need to be defended."
"Freedom of expression is one of the values forming the basis of democracy."
"The institutions of the European Union must protect the freedom of expression through their actions, as well as provide, in this regard, a source of inspiration for the whole world."
"However, the European Parliament cannot be involved as an arbitrator or lever in Member States' domestic policy disputes, as is the case with this resolution and also with the resolution concerning the 'situation' in Lithuania voted on during the previous sitting."
"In view of these considerations, I voted against the motion for a resolution."
"It is true that there is a significant lack of freedom of information in Italy, particularly because the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has brought the majority of the television channels directly or indirectly into his sphere of influence as a result of his political position and his media empire."
"However, this is not a problem which is specific to Italy."
"For example, in France, constitutional reform has led to the establishment of regulations which allow the president of the republic to appoint the heads of the public broadcasting companies (Groupe France Télévision, France 2-5)."
"This has caused significant controversy in France."
"(In addition, the chairman of the largest privately-owned television channel, TF1, was Mr Sarkozy's best man and therefore has a very close relationship with him.)"
"It is possible that this case, from the perspective of the European Union, is motivated more by party politics and by opposition to Mr Berlusconi, rather than being a genuine debate on the freedom of the media and the freedom of information."
"For this reason, I have voted against this motion for a resolution."
"Bearing in mind that three European Union Member States (including Romania) were classified by the organisation Freedom House as having a 'partially free' media, I strongly believe that intervention is required at European level to ensure that one of the most important principles of democracy, namely, freedom of the media is respected."
"I believe we must call on the Commission to guarantee pluralism in the media by implementing common standards at EU level."
"I voted in favour of the European Union resolution and I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the need to adopt a directive on the freedom of information."
"in writing. - The Green/EFA Group, together with the S&D Group, ALDE and GUE, have tabled a common text."
"Until the very last moment, all these groups proved their willingness to take on board other political groups in this House, including proposals by the EPP to include concern about press freedom in other Member States."
"It turned out that these proposals were not serious attempts to find a consensus."
"The price to pay for such an agreement was the deletion of any reference to Italy, as well as our call on the Commission to put forward a Directive on media concentration and pluralism in the EU, which constitute the very essence of our resolution."
"The amendments tabled by the EPP only sought to dilute the text and were an attempt to divide the supporters of the text."
"That is why the Greens had to vote against even if, at least for some of them, we could have reached an agreement during the negotiations."
"That is not a constructive way of working on the part of the EPP."
"We regret that the right-wing groups once again refused to ask for a European response to a European problem."
"Freedom of the press is an absolute requirement."
"A democratic legislative institution like the European Parliament obviously cannot question this benefit."
"The protection and defence of freedom of information must be guaranteed in all circumstances."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice."
"Pluralism and freedom of all media must be ensured in the European Union, but it does not behove us as MEPs to judge a country and its leaders on the nature of the relations between the press and the political world."
"Interference by the European Parliament in this area is unacceptable."
"What is our legitimacy for issuing any opinion whatsoever on the condition of the Italian media?"
"This is an internal political debate of a Member State, a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the State concerned."
"The rejection of the amendment which intended to change the name of this resolution to give it a more Community-orientated feel demonstrates the targeted and purely political nature of this debate."
"We must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court."
"We refused to take part in the final vote on a motion for a resolution which, on the pretext of controlling Berlusconi in the Italian media, promotes the more general interests of the plutocracy in order to concentrate the media at national and European level."
"It calls for directives to be adopted which will essentially alter the right to information and freedom of expression on internal market and competition matters, by imposing the manipulations of big business on information and adjusting the public service to private-sector criteria and the rules of the free market."
"The centre right and centre left supporters of the European one-way street are commending and are eager for outright intervention by the EU in the internal affairs of the EU of the Member States, are supporting the sovereignty of big business in the field of information and are jostling, with unsavoury confrontations and masked intentions, to see who will win the favour of the plutocracy to best serve its interests."
"The major media contractors are attempting, in a vulgar manner, to manipulate the conscience of the workers, so as to impose the anti-grassroots policy of capital applied by the centre right and centre left governments."
"The people are not deceived by the cockfights in the European Parliament and efforts to elevate it to the post of censor which, moreover, is the basic support framework for the interests of capital."
"We support the joint motion for a resolution, but we do not wish to be associated with references to a proposal for a directive by the Commission on concentrations in the media and the protection of pluralism, because we consider that this competence, on such a serious and necessary matter, should be vested in the Member States."
"in writing. - By voting in favour of the joint resolution tabled by the S&D, ALDE, Greens and GUE, I feel I have shown my support for freedom of the media in Italy."
"As an elected representative, I believe it is my role to support moves to prevent an over-controlling media presence, not only in Italy but across European Member States."
"I believe monopolisation of the media to be dangerous and think it is necessary to push for greater freedom in the media across Europe."
"European citizens should not be subject to media censorship and selective news coverage."
"Mr President, a little over a year ago, I took my seat for the first time on these benches and I was incredibly moved given the deep respect I have for the European institutions and for this Parliament in particular."
"I deeply regret the fact that this House is being degraded by being forced to waste time on targeted attacks by political parties that are using and abusing it for their own national and regional interests."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely the events taking place at the lowest, provincial level in Italy that are the greatest demonstration of freedom of the press and of information: think of all the local newspapers, the newspapers of the cities, large and small, that people read every day and see who they talk about!"
"Think of newspapers such as La Repubblica and of the entire left-wing press."
"Today, the European Parliament has once again lost the opportunity to tackle a serious debate on freedom of the media in Europe, which is being held hostage by those who are using this House for the purposes of attacking the Italian Prime Minister."
"I voted for this resolution criticising the deteriorating situation of the press in Europe, especially in Italy, and which thereby demanded legislation on media mergers."
"Therefore, I find it absolutely scandalous that the European right - amongst them MEPs of the UMP - has spoken out against the protection of freedom of expression, thus aligning themselves with the position of the extreme right and Europhobe MEPs."
"Through this vote, the European right has shown that its reflex action was to protect the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, a member of the PPE and at the head of a media empire that is unprecedented for a political figure, Mr Berlusconi regularly threatens journalists and elected members who oppose his actions."
"This is no interference to say that the fact that the Head of the Italian Government controls the transalpine media is an insult to the freedom of the European press."
"Surely Italian democracy deserves respect, like all the EU democracies."
"However, its representative has not shown himself worthy of it today."
"It is in the name of our respect for the Italian people that we have a duty to censure him today."
"in writing. - I voted for this joint motion due to my deep concern at the concentration of media ownership in Italy and across Europe."
"In Ireland, we have a possible similar situation developing and I hope the European Parliament will explore this issue again."
"These questions must be fully explored and a watching brief should be maintained by the Parliament in relation to these developments and trends in media ownership in Ireland and across the EU."
"I also note my disappointment that Fianna Fáil TDs voted against this modest motion on media ownership in Italy."
"in writing. - The issue voted on refers to issues of regulation of media ownership."
"Many people refer to the democratic deficit of the EU; however; given the concentration of media ownership throughout Europe, the greatest threat to real democracy are the media barons of the world."
"If people think owners do not influence newspapers think again."
"Rupert Murdoch owns almost 200 news outlets throughout the world."
"Only a minority of those had an anti-war stance on Iraq."
"Democracy depends on the public being informed."
"Concentration of media ownership means that enhancing the business interests of an elite minority can be disguised as independent editorial."
"The public must always be given a choice when it comes to news dissemination."
"In Ireland, we have our own problems with media ownership that we must regulate."
"This House must support freedom of speech and freedom of media expression."
"It is with regret that colleagues on the right differed."
"Following the vote on the joint resolution on freedom of information in Italy and in the European Union as a whole, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is very satisfied."
"What we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the European Parliament: we are a legislative assembly and not a tribunal on the internal affairs of the Member States."
"It would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament."
"I am very pleased with the outcome of the vote."
"Although it was very close, it re-establishes the value of the principle of subsidiarity within the European Union and its institutions."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Welcome"
"I am delighted to inform you that the delegation from the Parliament of South Africa have taken their seats in the distinguished visitors' gallery."
"I would like to extend a warm welcome to the South African delegation which is here to take part in the 14th inter-parliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the South African Parliament."
"The head of the African delegation, Mrs Joanmariae Louise Fubbs, Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Industry of the National Assembly of South Africa, is accompanied by the Chairman of the Committee on International Relations and five other colleagues from the South African Parliament."
"As you know, Europe and South Africa share the same values, as far as democracy, human rights and multilateral cooperation is concerned."
"The Republic of South Africa is not only a regional power but also a rising global power and a valued partner who will help us to solve the challenges of the global financial and economic crisis."
"We firmly believe that we must deepen our dialogue and develop ever closer relations and cooperation."
"Our two regions should act together, not only over efforts to find a way out of the current crisis, but also in the creation of a new global order that will be of lasting benefit to us all."
"Once again then, Mrs Joanmariae Louise Fubbs and esteemed colleagues from the South African Parliament, I welcome you."
"The institutional aspects of the creation of a European external action service - Creation of a European external action service: State of the negotiations with Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on Elmar Brok's report on the institutional aspects of setting up the European External Action Service - and the declaration of the Council and the Commission on the creation of a European External Action Service."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the time when the Treaty of Lisbon will finally be ratified and we are now beginning to consider how the treaty should be implemented."
"We all know that the constitution must be turned into reality, which is just as important as the written words in a constitution or in a primary law, such as the treaty."
"Therefore, I would like to remind everyone once again about the original intention, because our current discussions about the External Action Service, the High Representative and the Vice-President of the Commission represent one result of the Constitutional Convention, which was taken over by the intergovernmental conference for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The intention was to make the European Union more efficient by moving towards a situation where Europe speaks to the world with a single voice."
"This is why we need this new type of High Representative and Vice-President, who must have a reliable service so that he or she can do justice to this task."
"The second principle of the Constitutional Convention was transparency and the third was democracy."
"These were the three starting points and it was clear to the parliamentary majority of the Constitutional Convention, which was made up in particular of national members of parliament, that the European Union is always better in areas where it acts according to the community method and is always relatively poor in areas where it acts according to the intergovernmental method."
"In line with the spirit of these preparations, the implementation of the treaty must not lead to a strengthening of the intergovernmental approach with the result that the community method, which is democratically controllable, more successful and more transparent, is suppressed."
"Therefore, I sometimes do not understand why the Member States are primarily interested in organigrams, but not in how these principles are put into practice."
"We are of the opinion that we do not need a new bureaucracy located in the middle between the Council and the Commission which, in the long term, would consist of 6 000 to 8 000 people, would lead a life of its own and would become an independent kingdom outside our control."
"Let us assume that this service will be assigned to the Commission as an administrative body and let us recognise that it must have a sui generis character."
"It cannot be a normal office of the Commission, because in the area of foreign and security policy, the authority is divided between the Community and the Council."
"Therefore, we must ensure that there is a safeguard in place for the Council so that its rights can be expressed in a reasonable way and so that a loyal approach is taken."
"It is important to emphasise that the national experts in the Commission must be treated in a different way than was previously the case; in other words, they must be given equal rights."
"It must be made clear that Parliament's scrutiny and budget rights must in no way be restricted, but instead should be strengthened."
"Therefore, I would like to remind the Commission at this point in the debate that we not only have the right of consultation, but also that we parliamentarians have forced the Commission to give its consent."
"We will not leave the Commission and the High Representative out of the hearings."
"We must ensure that, in the case of changes relating to staff regulations and financial regulations, the European Parliament has the right of codecision in the same way as in the budget procedure."
"Therefore, I would like to invite the two institutions to describe in their declarations the way in which the principles of efficiency, transparency and democracy can be combined with one another."
"This is not clear to me from the earlier COREPER documents which I had access to."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Brok, honourable Members, the development of the European External Action Service is a matter that I know is of great interest to you here in Parliament."
"I read with great interest and a strong sense of involvement the report tabled by Mr Brok and approved on Monday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Naturally, the Presidency is in complete agreement with what Mr Brok says in his report about the External Action Service in fact being key to our common work to make European foreign policy into an active and more cohesive instrument to enable European policy to be viewed in a better light around the world."
"The intention is to bridge the gap that has existed between the Commission's and the Council's work so that the Union's policies are moving in the same direction."
"This is necessary in order for us to be able to be as effective as possible."
"It is therefore important that we give the External Action Service as good a start as possible."
"This is one of the greatest and most important challenges in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"There are many pieces of the puzzle that need to fall into place and extensive preparations are therefore underway in the Council."
"The objective is for the European Council to agree on a report that the High Representative, once he or she has been appointed, will be able to use as a starting point when he or she tables a proposal on the External Action Service."
"During this work, the European Parliament will, of course, be consulted in connection with the tabling of the proposal by the High Representative."
"Until this time, the Presidency will ensure that there is a regular dialogue with the European Parliament."
"We have had this dialogue up to this point and will continue to do so."
"It is important for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to have regular contact on these issues, not only between officials, but also at policy level."
"Immediately after the Irish referendum - and we are very pleased that the result was positive - the Member States and the Commission began very intensive work to prepare the European External Action Service."
"This work is progressing and I am absolutely certain that we will be able to present a number of usable ideas to the European Council next week with regard to the future High Representative."
"Since it is the High Representative's job to table the final proposal, he or she will, of course, be involved in the work as soon as he or she has been appointed."
"This is very important in order to enable him or her to have some input into the proposal."
"The Presidency will present an agreement on principles covering five major elements, namely, the scope of the External Action Service's activities, its legal position, its staffing and financing and the EU delegations."
"We have not completed this yet and discussions are still ongoing, but I will give you an idea of how far we have progressed hitherto, and in this regard, there appears to be a high level of agreement between the Council and the Commission, and I hope eventually with the European Parliament, too."
"With regard to the scope of the European External Action Service's activities, it is clear that we should establish geographical and thematic 'desk functions' with collective responsibility for tasks that are currently handled by the Commission and the Council Secretariat."
"The Commission will continue to have the main responsibility for matters relating to trade, aid and enlargement, even though it still remains to be established exactly where the dividing line between the Commission and the External Action Service is to go with regard to aid."
"The Member States and the Commission also agree that the legal status of the External Action Service should reflect and support the unique role, sui generis, that it has within the EU system."
"Whatever legal solution is finally decided upon, it must fulfil the principles of good administration and the prospect of accountability."
"Staff will be recruited from the Commission, the Council Secretariat and the Member States."
"This is clearly laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"All of these categories of personnel are to be entitled to take office on equal terms."
"The EU delegations will be placed under the authority of the High Representative as soon as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force."
"One important matter in the setting up of the European External Action Service is contact with the European Parliament."
"Once the High Representative has been appointed, he or she will regularly consult the European Parliament on the principal paths and the important choices of direction within the common foreign and security policy as well as the common security and defence policy."
"I am sure that close contact with the European Parliament will also be fostered at the level of the officials."
"The European External Action Service should therefore have a facility that is responsible for contact with Parliament."
"This is roughly as far as we have got in the discussions."
"I cannot go into more detail, as we have not finished our talks yet, but we will do everything we can to continue to keep Parliament informed of the progress made."
"Of course, the High Representative has not yet been appointed, so these ideas are still just ideas, that is all."
"Ultimately, it will be the High Representative who tables the proposal in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty."
"With that, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak and I look forward to a constructive debate, during which I will, of course, listen very closely to Parliament's views and answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we are, I hope, on the very last lap of the process of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force, completing a process which has taken eight years of discussions and negotiations."
"After the decisive result of the Irish referendum, we all hope that the Czech ratification can finally follow very soon."
"If we achieve this on the 20th anniversary of the reunification of Europe, it will be a great day for Europe and its citizens - not least because we will be able to focus all our attention on the pressing challenges and policy concerns that lie ahead of us."
"As we reach the final stages, allow me to congratulate Parliament, and particularly the Constitutional Affairs Committee, with Elmar Brok as rapporteur, on delivering its opinion on the key element of the Lisbon Treaty which is the External European Action Service."
"The creation of the EEAS offers the European Union and all its component institutions the chance to achieve what we have long hoped for: to have a common voice in the world and to strengthen the EU's influence in the world."
"Mr Brok's report recognises this great potential."
"Together with this important debate and many other consultations with Parliament representatives, it provides vital input to our work with the Swedish Presidency, but also with the Member States and the Council Secretariat, over the coming months."
"I am happy to confirm that the Commission strongly supports Parliament's overall approach."
"I agree with the principles of transparency, democracy and coherence that you have just mentioned."
"It is obviously important that all the institutions work together to help the newly-appointed High Representative Vice-President in his or her task of preparing the decision on the creation of an EEAS - a decision which, as you know, requires the consent of the Commission and the consultation of Parliament."
"Firstly, let me mention the status of the EEAS."
"Indeed it will be sui generis as there is no model to follow."
"We are building something new."
"It will neither be intergovernmental nor purely based on the Community method, but we must ensure that the new system has a genuinely European approach inspired by and grounded in the strengths of Community policies, as again was mentioned."
"The key question for us all is what the EEAS should be able to deliver."
"This should be our objective."
"By bringing together the various actors in the field of external relations, we can ensure that our relations with the outside world are clear, coherent and driven by a single set of policy goals."
"It must carry authority as the core of EU external policy, the place where policy is developed and coordinated."
"It must also be seen to be such, both from inside and from outside the European Union, and the EEAS will only be effective if it works well with other institutions and fully respects the interinstitutional balance."
"This is why I think it is very important that the EEAS should be set up in a way which allows it to work very closely with the Commission and the Council and to respect the need to be fully accountable to the European Parliament."
"For the Parliament, the bringing together of external action responsibilities into a single service will, I believe, mean a step change in Parliament's capacity to fulfil its role of scrutinising Union policy."
"Like the service itself, the way in which Parliament relates to the service and to the High Representative Vice-President will also, in a way, have to be sui generis."
"The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions, probably including changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations, both of which require a Commission proposal and adoption through codecision."
"The High Representative Vice-President needs the authority to manage the service, but the service also needs to serve the EU system as a whole - most obviously, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council, as well as the other Commissioners with a role in external relations."
"It must be able to offer its assistance, both in Brussels and in third countries, to the European Parliament and to its official delegations which travel abroad."
"The close involvement of the Member States in the new service is one of its key innovations."
"The COREPER ambassadors are looking at how best to ensure that high-quality Member States' diplomats can be brought into the service early."
"We in the Commission are examining how this may be done pending the modification of the Staff Regulations, and appointment to the service should be through selection procedures based on merit, with appropriate account being taken of the need for a geographic and gender balance."
"This very much meets the wishes expressed in the report."
"We also believe that all members of the EEAS, whether officials of the EU institutions or Member States' officials on temporary contracts, should enjoy the same rights."
"They will be equal in every sense."
"As for the scope of the service, it needs to have a comprehensive overview of the Union's relations with the rest of the world, so it needs geographical desks as well as horizontal services to cover questions such as CFSP and CSDP, human rights and relations with UN bodies."
"The aim is to prevent duplication and to ensure that all those responsible for delivering EU external policy work effectively together, and the Commission will also continue to have services responsible for trade, development policy, aid implementation, humanitarian aid and enlargement."
"It will also, of course, continue to drive the external aspects of the Union's key internal policies, and a central question in the current debate is how to manage the programming of external assistance."
"I can assure Parliament that the EU's development policy, including poverty eradication, will be a central part of the Commission's external activities."
"The High Representative Vice-President and the Commissioner for Development will work extremely closely together on this."
"The fact that the new High Representative will also be a Vice-President of the Commission, responsible for coordinating all of the EU's external action, will help."
"The service will also be responsible for the administration of delegations, though the people inside delegations will come, as now, from different services - not just the EEAS, but also the Commission services and maybe other institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"From the entry into force of the Treaty, Commission delegations will become EU delegations."
"This will give them new responsibilities, but it will not diminish their role in representing the full range of Commission activities."
"The EU delegations should be responsible for representation, coordination and negotiation as from the day the Treaty comes into force."
"In most places, this procedure will go quite smoothly."
"However, in some, where the workload is particularly heavy, it will be necessary to organise a form of burden-sharing, not only with the rotating Presidency but also with other Member States."
"The creation of an entirely new external service is a major undertaking."
"It will, as your report says, evolve over time."
"We will learn together."
"Our first aim must be that during the period between the entry into force of the Treaty and the coming into being of the EEAS, the effective delivery of the EU's external policies is maintained."
"We and the Council Secretariat will work together with the High Representative Vice-President to ensure that there is no gap."
"But we need to look further."
"We will be bringing together officials and diplomats from the different institutions and all the Member States."
"As we know, a common foreign policy is not just the sum of 27 national policies."
"We need people within the EEAS who, while not losing their distinctive national ties, think European."
"We therefore need to create an EU diplomatic culture and an EU esprit de corps."
"For this, training is essential."
"The report raises the promising idea of the creation of a European diplomatic academy."
"In the meantime, we can make good use of the Member States' diplomatic academies."
"I very recently attended the 10th anniversary of the European diplomatic programme, which has anticipated and shown the way."
"It is worth remarking that since the 1970s, the Commission has already organised training seminars for more than 5 700 diplomats."
"One of the tasks of the EEAS will be to establish a training strategy to ensure that all members, whatever their background, will be equipped to carry out their tasks."
"Heads of delegations, in particular, will have to be able not only to carry out their political role, but also to handle all the Commission activities that are such a substantial part of a delegation's mandate."
"Mr Brok's report also raises the question of whether consular services might be covered by the EEAS."
"The Commission is open to this idea even if it may take some time to develop."
"These are matters for the future."
"For the present, it is a challenge for us to ensure that the EEAS functions well and in the interests of all: the European citizens, the Member States and the European Union."
"The Commission supports the creation of the EEAS, wants it to succeed, and will contribute in every way possible to ensure that it does so."
"This report shows that Parliament will do the same."
"I am sorry to have been a little long, but I think this is such an important matter."
"Please forgive me, Mr President."
"Commissioner, of course I forgive you, because I fully agree with you. It is a very important topic."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, former colleagues from the European Convention, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Elmar Brok, on having clearly defined the position of the European Parliament on the matters associated with the creation of a European External Action Service."
"The establishment of such a service is a logical and necessary consequence of the decision to combine two foreign policy roles in one and it is crucial to the development of the European Union's foreign policy identity."
"Integrated diplomacy will mean simplification, more unified and more effective action, as well as greater visibility and recognisability."
"The issue of how to install this joint service is not merely a technical one."
"It will also impact on the implementation of the political intention which the European Union wishes to achieve by vesting the roles of High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission in one person."
"The development of the new service should spring from the same spirit which brought together these two foreign policy roles and which will result in the unification of the Council's and the Commission's foreign policy efforts."
"It is important that this service is established with due regard for the roles of, and cooperation between, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and that it is founded on mutual trust and the will to cooperate."
"Although I think that, in the interests of the European Union, the single service should commence operations as soon as possible, I strongly support the recommendation that it be phased in, in order to enable it to adopt the most appropriate and most efficient form."
"It seems reasonable to me that the service should form part of the Commission's administrative structure, both in terms of organisation and budget."
"To me, it is absolutely vital that the future service also include staff from national diplomatic services, which would undoubtedly result in a better and more accessible service for European Union citizens and, in particular, for those countries which have only a small number of diplomatic representations."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this debate and with the report that we will approve tomorrow, this House intends to demonstrate its desire to help establish the European External Action Service, even at this preliminary stage, by conducting a constructive dialogue with the Council and with the Commission."
"We believe that calling for this interinstitutional dialogue straight away is above all useful and sensible, given that the procedure laid down by the treaty provides for Parliament to give its opinion on the proposal to be presented by the High Representative, and because Parliament's prerogatives as regards the budget make it crucial that it gives its consent and cooperates."
"This is without mentioning the consent of the Commission, as discussed by Mr Brok, which provides further scope for the European Parliament."
"However, we also believe that it is our duty to call for this dialogue straight away because the European External Action Service is one of the most important innovations introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Its characteristics are intended to have a considerable bearing on the way in which European governance is reorganised and thus, on the way in which the overall balance of the Union's institutions is decided on in practice."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament agrees with the position adopted in the Brok report, which it played an active part in drafting."
"It is a position that aims to develop the role that the Service can carry out as a bridge between the Community dimension of the Union's external action and the intergovernmental dimension of the common foreign and security policy, as laid down in Title V of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Naturally, we are aware of the unique nature of the Service, which also reflects that of the role of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, just as we are aware of the fact that the Service must not incorporate all of the services used by the Commission when it implements the numerous aspects of its external action - which does not just boil down to the CFSP - starting with development cooperation."
"However, we think it crucial that the Service be able to make the Union's foreign and security policy more effective and its external action as a whole more consistent."
"We also think it crucial that the Service be under the democratic control of Parliament and, to this end, we believe that its inclusion in the administrative structure of the Commission is the option that is most consistent with these objectives, which we really do have at heart."
"For this reason, we have voted in favour of the Brok report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Commission is quite correct to say that the service ought to combine all the instruments and assets that are required for the conduct of an active foreign policy across the globe."
"It is crucial that all the partners in this great project begin to trust each other and the service, including the most populous and imperious states."
"It is crucial for the Foreign Office in the UK to send their top people to the service rather than their discards."
"I agree fully that, for the sake of parliamentary scrutiny and financial control, the service ought to be attached to the Commission, for administrative and budgetary purposes."
"I have to say to the Council that it is not acceptable that the service is placed in the same class as the Economic and Social Committee or the Ombudsman as part of the Financial Regulation."
"I think that this Brok report has been a practical preparatory stage of the process of setting up the External Action Service but I also believe that we should pause now before we go further and settle important questions before the High Representative Vice-President is in place."
"For Parliament, it is crucial that we have a political interlocutor to negotiate the establishment and future programme of the External Action Service, so, please, states - bring us your people for all these posts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a great and a pleasant experience to work with several admirable people."
"I want to congratulate Mr Brok and also many others who made their contributions."
"Now, however, I would like to quote Mr Barroso, who this morning wisely stated: 'Even institutions do not last; we need enormous political will.'"
"Actually, institutional creation is not possible without political will."
"In order to prevent a situation where we create just one more institution, our political will must always be paramount at the creation of a new establishment."
"The goal is a truly European, and in reality, a sui generis organisation which serves the common interests of all Europe's citizens."
"If we want to avoid the duplication or possible waste of resources which is so typical, we must guarantee that the allocation of budgetary resources and the use of these resources takes place under the supervision of the European Parliament."
"The report broadly defines the principles reported to the European Supreme Court, which would help us to appoint the high representative and also to put a plan in place."
"After this plan, we will all be in a better position, and also we will get the opportunity to put our own political will into operation."
"As everyone is aware of the aspirations of the Green party - such as the concept of peace creation, the absolute application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, of course, the subject of gender equality - I will not start going over these today, though I promise to address these subjects again in due course."
"All the same, in my opinion, the Council would be very wise to consider appointing a female High Representative, as we all know that the President of the Commission is not a woman."
"In fact, a woman has never been appointed to lead Europe, and therefore if we are creating a new European institution, it would perhaps be a good idea to consider this aspect."
"In dealing with the report, I have drawn attention to certain negative attitudes coming from some areas."
"It was suggested that the European Parliament does not have any role to play here and that it is trying simply to give itself more importance with this report."
"My response to this attitude is that Parliament is important and we must take this into account."
"Our report about the European External Action Service provides a very good opportunity to bring such facts to light."
"Therefore, I call on everyone to support the adoption of the report, taking into account the fact that it does not incorporate all the improvements and wishes."
"The main thing is to adopt the report now."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I want to express my disappointment that yet again, this Parliament is considering a report that pre-empts the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I wonder whether we would be having this debate today if the German Constitutional Court were still considering the Treaty."
"I suspect not, and I ask why the Czech Republic is treated differently."
"As the English author, George Orwell, might have observed, all Member States are equal, but some are more equal than others."
"I want to speak against the setting-up of a European diplomatic college."
"At a time when all Member States face huge budgetary pressures, the EU should show restraint."
"We should act as guardians of the public purse."
"Our aim should be to spend public money prudently and endeavour to return money to the Member States and the taxpayers we represent, when we can."
"This proposal is uncosted."
"It is another example of how some Members of this Chamber are all too eager to make grand gestures with other people's money."
"A European diplomatic college is a waste of money and would become another burden on the taxpayer."
"I wish to remind colleagues that any common position on foreign policy would be determined by the Member States represented in the Council, not by the Commission, and certainly not by this Parliament."
"Any additional staff the EEAS requires should be seconded from the Member States, and they require no separate training."
"The policy that they will represent to the world will be that of the Council of Ministers, not some independent European policy."
"A diplomatic college would only become necessary if the EU were to take control of foreign affairs away from the Member States."
"I hope that day never comes and I will do my utmost to prevent it."
"(The speaker agreed to take a question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, could I ask the speaker if, should he be disappointed and the Treaty actually finds itself in force, he would support the appointment of Mr Chris Patten as the High Representative?"
"Mr President, I am very grateful to be asked my opinion, but I rather doubt that it will be my decision."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has repeatedly made clear in plenary its fundamental criticism of the direction and nature of the foreign and security policy of the European Union and has been opposed to following this course, including in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This joint debate at the beginning of this parliamentary term covers one of the most important reports of the term."
"Unfortunately, although I understand Mr Brok's motives from the perspective of parliamentary activity, we have to get something underway within a deadline which makes it difficult to weigh up properly and responsibly the dimensions and complex issues resulting from the content of this new structure."
"It has become clear during the course of the debate how much unfortunately is still up in the air and therefore within the political poker game between the interests of national power and government and the EU structures."
"The GUE/NGL group is opposed to this."
"Therefore, we hope that the European Parliament will have the opportunity after the negotiations to consider the European External Action Service (EEAS) again in accordance with the expectations expressed this morning in plenary to the Swedish Presidency concerning restraint in the formulation of the negotiating mandate."
"We in Parliament should also ensure that the citizens of Europe are as well-informed as possible about the different aspects of the EEAS, particularly in the face of the doubts and criticism relating to the Treaty of Lisbon and the demand for more transparency and democratic codecision in this respect."
"The discussions about the establishment of the EEAS have been taking place for months behind closed doors."
"My group would like to repeat that the failure to include the European Parliament, the civil society organisations that have so far been affected, or even the national parliaments, gives rise to serious questions."
"This is particularly the case because a lively debate and open and transparent discussions about the institutional structures are of great importance for their legitimacy in future and for their public accountability."
"As a result, I welcome Mr Brok's approach in which he attempts, by means of his report, to achieve parliamentary codecision for the European Parliament at the very least."
"Some of our requests aim to produce the same results."
"We oppose all efforts - and I say this unequivocally and categorically - to include political-military structures in the EEAS, regardless of whether this happens now or in the future, as has been recently proposed by France, among others, in the Council."
"The possible combination of military planning, secret service structures and general diplomatic and political tasks is not acceptable from our point of view."
"Mr President, yesterday, I was asked to give three reasons why people should vote against this report."
"That is pretty easy: democracy, democracy and democracy."
"First of all, it is farcical that any parliament would want to adopt a report based on a treaty, the fate of which is still completely uncertain."
"No one knows what the future of the Treaty of Lisbon is, and anyone with even the smallest modicum of respect for democratic structures - the smallest modicum of respect for Member States such as the Czech Republic - would hold back on this project until there was clarity about the future of the treaty."
"Secondly, this report (and the whole foreign affairs service that is now being constructed) represents a complete undermining and disavowal of and failure to appreciate the sovereign right of the Member States to conduct their own foreign policies."
"It is also the reason why this report seeks to make the Commission responsible for everything."
"The Commission, of course, particularly in its role as a 'civil servant', is very obviously not popularly elected."
"In other words, if the people want a different foreign policy, there is no chance on earth of changing the policy conducted as it is only the Council, meaning the governments, that people have the ability to change - not the Commission."
"That means, thirdly, that it is a democratic farce that this Parliament wants to hand more power, some absolutely crucial core areas within the sovereign State, to the Commission, which has no popular mandate."
"This Parliament is based solely on kratos - purely on power."
"It is never ever based on demos."
"Our focus should instead be on demos - we should be focused on the people and not on power."
"We must, therefore, have more democracy."
"For that reason, this report must be rejected."
"Mr President, this report tries to put our minds at rest about the service but, to my mind, it does exactly the opposite."
"It claims, on the one hand, that the service complements Member State diplomacy and does not call it into question."
"However, the rest of the report, in my view, flatly contradicts that assurance."
"Paragraph 4 says that the service - that means its powers - cannot be circumscribed or predetermined in advance."
"Paragraph 8(d) suggests that delegations, which are part of the service, might take over consular services from Member States."
"It is clear that this service is intended - not in the short term but in the long term - to take over and replace diplomatic representation of Member States, perhaps in the end, even the vetoes of the United Kingdom and France on the UN Security Council."
"When you hear an EU body giving an assurance that they will not do such and such, you have a pretty good clue as to what they are up to."
"With apologies to Mr Shakespeare, methinks the report doth protest too much."
"Who or what will actually exercise any control over this body?"
"Not, I think, the Council."
"That has to act unanimously."
"If it cannot decide, the service will simply be carrying on with its own agenda."
"What about the Parliament?"
"No, that is limited to consultation."
"This body will conduct foreign policy over the heads of Member States with no effective control by Member States or the European Parliament."
"National governments will be reduced to the status of a parish council."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I all I feel it is my duty to thank the rapporteur, who has done a marvellous job, and, as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I must also thank all of the members of the committee and of both committees - the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development - who delivered the opinion, for their very swift work."
"We have, in fact, tried to prepare a document - which I hope will be approved - that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October."
"We are well aware that this report is not a definitive report."
"It is intended merely to point out a few courses of action, a path of some kind to follow, to the Council and thus to the High Representative who will be appointed."
"It will be the High Representative's job to devise his own organisational plan which, in turn, will have to be examined by us."
"Therefore, it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our Parliament."
"We also know that the success of this operation regarding the External Action Service is linked to the role of the High Representative, who will have to be able to organise and manage everyone."
"Through him, we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy."
"We are well aware that there are problems, that much has already been said, but problems are there to be solved."
"The important thing is that the compass, the information, the scope is clear."
"The Brok report provides some interesting proposals in this regard - I have to be brief because my speaking time is up - but, in any case, they include the integration of the Service into the administrative structure of the Commission, the decision to further develop the Community model and the proposal, which is, moreover, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, that the staff must be taken from the secretariats of the Commission and the Council and from the delegations of the Commission itself."
"There are two innovations that I believe are worth mentioning: Union embassies, headed by officials from the European External Action Service, which would also include the Commission delegations present in third countries and the Council liaison offices, with the possible secondment of experts from the Directorates-General; and the foundations that have been laid for the establishment of a European diplomatic college, which is an interesting idea."
"My speaking time has run out."
"I only hope that this report really is adopted, and adopted by a large majority."
"Mr President, as we all know, the European External Action Service is one of the major innovations proposed by the Lisbon Treaty."
"Therefore, we have to be very careful and responsible during its setting-up."
"We all agree that it should start functioning as soon as the Lisbon Treaty is in force."
"The Commission and the Council are already working on the guidelines which they are expected to present to the European Council meeting at the end of this month."
"It is therefore essential that the European Parliament influences this process."
"Today's debate and the resulting resolution are of the utmost importance because we have to send a very clear message now as proof of political consensus on the setting-up of the service to the Council and to the European Commission."
"I am very proud of my colleague's work, which is the result of cross-party deliberations in this House."
"We insist that the Community model in the Union's external relations is preserved."
"The Members are keen to have the service attached to the European Commission and part of the overall community budget."
"The EEAS should form part of the Commission administratively and budget-wise, and should formally be a part of the Commission as a sui generis body attached to the Commission structure."
"The budgetary commission is extremely important."
"It is a lever with which the EP can exercise its power."
"In this way, Parliament should, and will, exercise budgetary control and democratic scrutiny over it."
"There are many issues to cover, for example, the clear division of tasks within the EEAS and the responsible European Commission units - taking into consideration that we do not know yet the structure of the future Commission - and the relation between the High Representatives and the different Union representatives abroad, but this resolution will be the first position of the European Parliament from which the further steps will follow."
"We should not forget about the human factor either."
"The High Representative should be a person of merit, expertise and excellence, supported by the Commission, Council and national diplomatic services."
"I am convinced the institutional set-up of the EEAS must include gender architecture that duly reflects the commitments made by the Union with regard to gender mainstreaming."
"Last but not least, as a person who has been working for women's equal political representation over the last 15 years, I would be glad if this person were a woman."
"(NL) Mr President, some fellow Members have seen fit to use their speeches to try to give us lessons in democracy."
"May I point out, therefore, that in both the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, whose opinion I drafted, we made sure that the discussion and vote on our respective texts were not held until the outcome of the Irish referendum had become known."
"We did so out of respect for the verdict the Irish people were to give."
"They did say 'yes', fortunately, but they could have said 'no'."
"We wanted to take account of this, and also of next week's European Council meeting."
"Hence, we had to accomplish our discussion and texts in an extremely short period of time."
"The same fellow Members who seek to give lessons in democracy have, of course, complained about this, too."
"I digress."
"Today, we are experiencing a particularly important point in time."
"Our texts expressing our opinion on what the future European External Action Service should look like herald a new era for the European Union."
"Those of us who have been following the evolution of the Union for years and remember the first modest steps on foreign policy, let alone security and defence policy, of the Treaties - first Maastricht, then Amsterdam - may have thought, as I did at the time, that we would never see this day, that we would never manage to lay down the foundations of a common European diplomacy."
"Those of us who have watched attentively as the ideas on this have evolved will also remember that, just a few months ago, some of our national diplomatic services were absolutely unwilling to accept a kind of instant 'big bang', with all the current delegations brought under the authority of the future High Representative from the very first day."
"I am absolutely delighted about this."
"My own political and governmental responsibilities in my previous political incarnations have taught me that none of this will be simple."
"Yet we are experiencing an important point in time, and I hope that this report will be adopted by a very large majority."
"(DE) Mr President, our group supports the basic structure proposed by Mr Brok in his report and, in particular, the retention of the controlling rights of the European Parliament and the retention of the Community tasks as Community tasks."
"However, in order to ensure that our common External Action Service is a great success and not just an appendage of the Commission or the Council, we must now discuss its content and its functions."
"The EU needs a new, integrated foreign policy which will allow it to confront the world's problems effectively."
"The External Action Service must enable the EU to implement comprehensive, integrated political strategies and campaigns."
"We need this service now, for example, during the discussions on climate change in Copenhagen."
"We must do away with traditional diplomacy, otherwise this service will bring very little added value."
"I would therefore like to promote four areas which, in our opinion, will help the service to create a new foreign policy."
"Firstly, we want the new service to have a directorate for peacebuilding and crisis management."
"We have the corresponding financial instruments and missions, but until now, we have only had small and fragmented organisational units."
"Secondly, we want the staff to be given comprehensive education and training."
"Simply having attended a diplomacy college is not enough."
"In addition, we want to ensure that those members of staff who wear uniforms have not merely been educated at the defence college."
"All of them must complete at least part of their education together and this is why we are calling for a European External Action Academy."
"Thirdly, we do not want a dual structure for the Council President within the Council Secretariat."
"Therefore, the External Action Service should also be supported by this organisation."
"As far as appointments to the top jobs are concerned, my colleague, Mr Tarand, has already mentioned that we firmly believe that it is time that a woman is appointed."
"Mr President, as the Union seeks a broader role in international affairs, it arguably should have the tools to project our common values throughout the world, providing, of course, there is unanimity in all 27 Member States."
"But how will that role develop?"
"Where will its limits be?"
"We in the ECR Group believe, as an anti-federalist body, that foreign policy must ultimately remain the preserve of our individual Member States."
"It is therefore of concern to us that the Lisbon Treaty, if it becomes law, appears to set in train a series of developments that could end up undermining that prerogative."
"The proposed European External Action Service must complement and not compete with or undermine Member States' bilateral diplomatic activity and must draw its authority mainly from the Council and not from the Commission."
"Parliament must exercise its rights to scrutinise the EEAS and shape its budget."
"Given that there is much talk about EU embassies in the Brok report, I would like the Commission once again to repeat the assurances it gave me a year ago that EEAS missions or delegations will not be called embassies."
"To call these missions embassies would compound the fear that the EU is seeking all the trappings of a sovereign state."
"(ES) Mr President, my group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - is going to vote against this report, primarily because we do not support the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For us, the Treaty of Lisbon does not reflect the spirit of the European project envisaged by and for the citizens."
"In fact, quite the opposite is the case."
"It provides a model in crisis, a model which prevents public intervention in the economy."
"There is a desire to move forward at two different speeds: we are hurrying to ensure that Europe has a single voice abroad, but the European Union does not have the power to call the economy back to life using its own instruments, as it has no treasury or any active industrial policies."
"Neither does it have the capacity to intervene in the price of money nor control of the European Central Bank."
"Therefore, we do not share this philosophy."
"If the Treaty of Lisbon is adopted, with the Commission's approval and following parliamentary consultations, five thousand officials will be employed at the European External Action Service, following a decision of the Council, based on a proposal by the future Vice-President."
"We do not agree with this structure because it is also being given the powers to solve all kinds of military crises."
"We believe that there is a lack of control."
"In our opinion, this control should fulfil the highest democratic requirements, as is the case in each Member State."
"Therefore, we think that this philosophy does not follow in the spirit of the kind of Europe that our group want to build, namely a Europe that is, in fact, capable of intervening in matters that fundamentally affect us, such as the current recession and unemployment rates that are currently the highest they have been since the 1930s."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to vote against this report."
"Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate."
"The wicked Lisbon constitution already forces an unelected President and Foreign Minister on us all."
"Now this report adds a new European diplomatic service, the so-called European External Action Service, but embassies represent national interests."
"So what national interests will these new EU diplomats and embassies represent?"
"They will not be those of our nation states, our trade or our companies."
"They will be those of the European Commission."
"All other national embassies will become redundant."
"Already, British embassies around the world are selling off properties."
"This master plan for an EU superstate is built on foundations of deceit, dishonesty and denial, but federalists are not creating a new United States of America."
"They are creating a new Yugoslavia."
"By forcing very different nations, cultures and economies together under a rigid, undemocratic Soviet-style bureaucracy, you are entering very dangerous waters indeed."
"I worked for the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process."
"I saw what happened when democracy fails."
"It is not pretty."
"Now I see democracy failing here in Europe."
"You profess to love peace but, by railroading through Lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies, you are putting Europe firmly back on the road towards war once again."
"(DE) Mr President, the Council's actions are not transparent."
"The decisions are made de facto in the numerous, largely non-transparent working groups and in COREPER."
"In 2008, only 1% of the agenda items in the Council of Foreign Ministers were debated publicly."
"Against precisely this background, the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) has been developed since the end of the 1990s without any consultation or democratic control."
"Against precisely this background, the European External Action Service will also be established."
"My response is a clear 'No'."
"This must not happen!"
"We need genuine democratic parliamentary control and we also need genuine transparency."
"I am also rather surprised that you in particular, Mr Brok, are now suddenly in favour of parliamentary control."
"Is it not the case that specifically in the area of the ESDP, the Treaty of Lisbon will remove this parliamentary control?"
"However, you are in favour of this treaty."
"On the subject of budgetary control, it is quite clear from the discharge of the Council how your group is acting."
"Is it not the case that in the next few weeks, your group will vote in favour of the discharge of the Council in the Committee on Budgetary Control, although the Council has not given adequate responses?"
"It is unfortunate that although your draft has very good beginnings, it is in fact hypocritical, it is not credible and it is ultimately an admission of the failings of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thank you very much Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I have to start with the footnotes."
"As much as I really admire the rhetorical flair of our friends from UKIP, I find it quite interesting as someone coming from Central Europe that you are so ready to share your experience of living under the Titoist regime in Yugoslavia or under the Soviet regime."
"Really interesting."
"First of all, let me congratulate Elmar Brok for preparing a report which so magnificently represents the mainstream, and let me repeat that, the mainstream of this House."
"With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the new Service, we will increase our ability to speak with one voice."
"We agree that the new Service should be as close to the Commission as possible, because only the Community method guarantees the coherence of our actions and, most importantly, the points of view of us all will be taken into account to the same degree."
"For the new service to be credible it has to be endowed with as much democratic legitimacy as possible."
"Therefore, all the efforts to take care of this House's powers of scrutiny have to be saluted."
"Most importantly we have to do everything to ensure that the new service is of the best quality and that it is trusted by everyone."
"We have to do our utmost so that the Commission, the Council and 27 Member States send their best people to work in the EEAS."
"That is why they have to enjoy the same status."
"Work in the Service should be treated as an integral part of their career at home."
"The people working for the service have to be chosen on merit, but also according to geographic balance so as to counteract the unfounded fears that the Service could be hijacked by anyone."
"The Lisbon Treaty is important and different from all the other treaties because so much depends on its implementation."
"I hope that the insights of this House will help the Council and the Commission to actually implement this Treaty in such a way that we will increase our ability to speak with one voice."
"Mr President, I want to welcome the Brok report and urge rapid progress on establishing the EEAS as a democratically accountable service."
"I have great hopes that this service can lead to greater coherence between our policy objectives and decisions, particularly as they impact globally on sustainable development, on human rights, and on the eradication of poverty."
"We have failed so far to ensure that our policies are coherent."
"Often our trade policies conflict directly with our development cooperation policy."
"I also want to warn against any thoughts about subsuming development policy as part of our foreign policy."
"We need an autonomous development service answerable to an autonomous Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid."
"To ensure coherence, we need benchmarking, screening and impact assessment for proposed decisions as they impact on development policy objectives."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Brok and thank him for the excellent report - I would even call it a remarkable report - that he has presented to us."
"The creation of this new external service is an opportunity that should not be missed."
"Parliament must have its say, not only on the budget, but also on the service's overall structure."
"As has been said, this service will have to have internal operating rules that are one of a kind."
"We cannot do without such operating rules, which are in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty. To act otherwise would be to arouse the distrust of certain Member States."
"I am thinking in particular of the smallest and newest Member States."
"We must also focus on the core of the external service's mandate, set the strategy and the political priorities, and create consistency within external action."
"It is vital not to fall into the trap of duplication by the external service and the Commission delegations, but instead to develop a specific service generating added value for joint external action."
"The external service must be wholly in step with the Commission."
"It must not drift off course to become or inspire intergovernmental action."
"I would also like to add that the profile of the High Representative/Vice-President is clearly crucial for the added value of the service."
"Finally, Mr President, while we both agree that the sphere of development has its own aim, at the same time, it is an external policy instrument."
"To deny that would be naive."
"One solution could be to keep programming as a responsibility of the Commissioner for Development, in agreement with the High Representative."
"The final point is that this debate cannot be separated from the debate on the budget for the European Development Fund."
"(NL) Mr President, now that the Irish referendum is behind us, the European Parliament is again venturing to show what it stands for, and is doing so with great drive and enthusiasm."
"This report paints a Utopian panorama of an external service that is to implement the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which is not yet functional."
"One striking feature of this report is its heroic attempt to urge the Commission to throw its full institutional weight into the balance."
"What is the reason for this position?"
"I think that many of my fellow Members wish to use the external service as a Trojan horse to gain control of the CFSP via the Commission."
"It is a disgrace that the European Parliament and the other institutions still have no idea of exactly how this service is supposed to work."
"The gradual process discussed in paragraph 4 is a risky institutional venture, pure and simple, and will surely end in institutional tears, if you will excuse the pun."
"Mr President, I too would like to add my voice to those who support the Brok report and also to express my fascination for the paranoia that has come from that side of the House."
"The External Action Service is, without any doubt, a potentially major element in the promotion of coherence in the EU's relations with the rest of the world."
"These relations are often wide-ranging, complex and have a significant impact on the world outside Europe."
"It is vital, therefore, that these activities are thoroughly coordinated in order to ensure that EU policies have the impact that they were designed to have."
"Indeed, once the External Action Service is up and running, it will affect the EU's stance, for example, on the common foreign and security policy, as has already been noted, the promotion of the democracy agenda, human rights, channelling of aid, and dealing with the multi-faceted issues of development."
"The question of coherence is central in this context."
"If different parts of the European Union place different emphases on policy issues, the impact will be muted and will very likely have unintended consequences."
"Consistency is pivotal in this connection."
"The External Action Service will, in the light of this, have a considerable responsibility in working together with all the other institutions of the European Union that have an external dimension."
"Clearly, the effectiveness of the Service will necessarily structure the work of the High Representative but, in the medium term, its work will resonate throughout all the institutions of the European Union."
"It is a two-way process."
"When seen from this perspective, it is essential that the Service should be accountable, obviously to the High Representative but also, more broadly, to Parliament itself."
"The Service will, at the end of the day, represent the European Union in all its aspects, hence the emphasis on accountability, transparency and coherence."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one Europe, one voice!"
"We have taken another important step towards a common foreign policy for the Member States."
"The decisive factor involves ensuring that the position of the High Representative is held by a strong, independent, competent person and that he or she has the necessary scope and freedom to develop and structure the service in accordance with the requirements and, of course, in accordance with the principles of the European Union, which include the observance of fundamental human rights."
"That is sui generis."
"It is essential that this is done transparently, that Parliament plays an appropriate role and that budgetary rights and budgetary control remain with the budgetary authority."
"However, it is also essential that the national governments once and for all give their own interests a lower priority and offer their full support to this office and to the tasks of the service and do not constantly stick their oar in whenever they feel like it, which is what we are unfortunately used to."
"It must also be made clear, and this is very important to us, that development policy should remain independent, because these things must not be combined arbitrarily."
"Let us see the new office and the portfolio which we have fought for over a number of years as an opportunity for the future and let us not talk it down and pull it to pieces right from the beginning."
"One Europe, one voice!"
"That is our task and that is what we must focus on: no more and no less."
"(DE) Mr President, what do we want to achieve with the European diplomatic service?"
"We want to set the political priorities of the European Union for the 21st century."
"Many countries and many people outside Europe expect Europe to play a strong role in peacekeeping and conflict prevention and, in areas where this has not worked, to restore peace and to help reconstruct the country in question."
"For this reason, it makes sense to establish a peacebuilding department."
"However, in the negotiations, some of the representatives of the Member States in the Council have put their foot heavily on the brakes, including the representatives of Member States which are generally regarded as pro-European."
"At best they have one foot on the accelerator and one on the brakes."
"This generates a lot of heat, but not much movement."
"We therefore hope that the negotiations for a really strong European External Action Service (EEAS) controlled by the European Parliament are successful."
"The citizens of Europe want Europe to speak with one voice."
"People outside Europe expect this."
"The EEAS will not be able to achieve this on its own. However, it represents a step in the right direction."
"Let us make sure that it works."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, given the importance of the subject under discussion, Parliament should have had more time to explain its position to the Council."
"Instead, the committee process lasted only a few days and we are now holding a debate in Parliament two days after the adoption of the provision within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The proposal to establish the European diplomatic service is a leap forward when compared with what is strictly provided for by the treaties."
"Furthermore, the European External Action Service, as it is described by the report, appears difficult to integrate with the Member States' foreign affairs ministries."
"What will happen to these ministries?"
"Will they dissolve?"
"That seems unlikely."
"Moreover, how will the powers of these embassies, with regard to visas, for instance, fit in with the work already carried out by the national embassies?"
"Who will the so-called ambassadors of the European Union be appointed by?"
"By the Commission, as seems likely, or will the Member States be able to appoint their own?"
"Moreover, the idea of calling the future representatives 'ambassadors' is provocative, given that the European Constitution, which provided for a European foreign affairs minister, has not been adopted."
"We cannot pretend that the European Constitution was not rejected by the French and the Dutch."
"(PL) Mr President, our European Union project is, of course, unique, and we have stressed this many times."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon which, I hope, will be accomplished effectively, will also create new institutions."
"One result of these moves will be the establishment of the European External Action Service, which is primarily intended to ensure that external relations are both coherent and effective."
"As Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said, it will be a sui generis entity but, at the same time, it is worth recalling Mr Brok's statement that the fundamental principles which should apply in the creation of this service, alongside effectiveness, are transparency and a democratic mandate."
"Effectiveness should be ensured by consensus on establishment of the European External Action Service, both among the institutions, and here I am pleased by the declarations of the Council and the Commission, but also by the inclusion of matters related to development aid, humanitarian aid, enlargement and international trade."
"The EU also needs a strong voice in matters which concern energy policy and solidarity, for example."
"Regarding transparency, I expect a balance to be achieved when establishing the European External Action Service."
"I have in mind not only a balance between institutions, but also a geographical balance when making appointments to the European External Action Service."
"This is something of vital importance that I cannot emphasise enough."
"The current representation does not meet this requirement if, for example, we consider Directorate-General RELEX or the Commission Delegations outside the EU."
"The service should be established pursuant to democratic standards, and I expect Parliament to play a significant role here, both in the establishment process and later in the interviewing of candidates for heads of delegations, together with the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"As concerns training personnel, it is proposed to create a European diplomatic college."
"This is an important venture but, at the same time, I would like to take this opportunity of stressing that there are, in fact, national centres, and also numerous European colleges with experience in training personnel."
"We ought to draw on this experience."
"I have in mind Bruges, Natolin, Florence and Maastricht."
"(FR) Mr President, I would also like to welcome the establishment of the European External Action Service as a step in the right direction, representing progress in making Europe more consistent and effective on the international stage."
"I also believe creating this service will add a significant political dimension to the European project and give Europe a more political profile."
"I would also like to underline the need for consistency within the action taken by the service with regard to administrative and budget responsibilities and on this point, of course, relations with the Commission, on the one hand, and with Parliament, on the other, are crucial."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, I also believe that this service must cooperate directly and very closely with Parliament in order to keep MEPs constantly informed of its activities, as well as appointments to the most important posts."
"In addition, the High Representative will, naturally, be a well-known figure, but I believe that the other members of the service should also be people who inspire a high level of confidence."
"I would also like to emphasise the issue of recruitment."
"As some of my fellow Members have said, I think that geographical representativeness is important, and a balance must be found for the small countries and for the new Member States."
"Finally, I would like to mention briefly the importance of this common European culture which, of course, is being created in different schools and different institutions, but I believe that a consistent initiative on the subject, creating a European-level structure, would be a good idea."
"(PT) Mr President, it is essential that the primary objective in creating the European External Action Service is to consolidate the efforts of the European Institutions, ensuring the creation of an efficient service capable of articulating, formulating and implementing a European response to the present international challenges."
"It should also be more than the sum of its parts; it should constitute added value to the existing efforts by the Member States and the European Union."
"Against this backdrop, I believe it is essential that what makes the EU special - in other words, the Community method - should take centre stage in this new reality."
"That is why I fully support the Brok Report, which advocates and safeguards close collaboration between the Commission and the future service."
"On this note, I would like to point out two things."
"Firstly, there needs to be close coordination between the President of the Commission and the High Representative, who will also be a Vice-President of the Commission, in order to ensure that it is effective and works smoothly."
"Secondly, there is the need for an alliance between Parliament and the Commission in order to combat the expected intergovernmental drift, which may compromise the effective running of the service."
"Parliament must therefore be vigilant and make sure that the European External Action Service will be a centre of excellence, representing the best expertise in foreign policy."
"Mr Preda, in your speech, you used the phrase 'a common European culture'."
"Do you regard the admission of Turkey into the European Union as being fully compatible with the common European culture to which you alluded?"
"(RO) I talked in my speech about a common culture from a diplomatic perspective, as part of a political culture."
"As far as I am concerned, I believe that, in this sense, Turkey is also part of this European political culture which includes a totally respectable tradition of diplomacy."
"Thank you for your question."
"This is what I should have addressed first."
"(DE) Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am concerned about the way in which the Commission and the Council are excluding the European Parliament when it comes to the question of the External Action Service."
"We have no documents and we are the only ones who have no documents, who have not been involved and who are forced to accept what has been negotiated."
"This is outrageous!"
"What I have seen during this debate and following the statements by the two representatives is that the Community instruments are being dismantled."
"We will also see an opt-out from the instruments which involve parliamentary rights, such as the Budget Regulation."
"We in the European Parliament must pay attention."
"The answer to the question of 'Who decides what?' has not become clear to me in the course of the debate."
"I believe that this is an open question."
"I also believe that if our budgetary and control rights and our codecision on this issue are not respected, it will be very difficult for us to work together with the Council and the Commission over the next few years."
"Mr President, I want to support a strong External Action Service with geographic desks covering the whole world, responsibility for the European Security and Defence Policy, and combining Council and Commission functions on planning, conflict prevention and crisis management."
"But I do want to agree with Mrs Malmström that this is not prejudiced by retaining responsibility for trade development and enlargement in the Commission, which is why I have collaborated with my colleague, Mr Gualtieri, on an amendment to paragraph 6(c) supporting bringing together EU development policy programming and implementation."
"The critics should understand that there are problems in the existing system."
"A High Representative with no direct responsibility to us in Parliament, duplication of functions between Council and Commission, splits between EU Special Representative and Commission heads of delegation, human rights sometimes ignored for trade and geopolitical interests, etc."
"This major reform of the Lisbon Treaty has to be made to work and will do so."
"Finally, to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I know she will be containing her excitement following the intervention of the UK Independence Party and she understands that British Embassies are not up for sale."
"(SL) Mr President, what we are doing today is giving the green light to the European Union to press on with a major achievement in its efforts to create a greater and more important role for itself in global foreign politics."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Brok on a detailed and very substantive report."
"I believe that it is vital that the new service should complement the existing services of the European Union, which will continue to be offered."
"It is also important that European Union representations around the world are not duplicated or triplicated."
"It seems to me that there is a real risk of that happening."
"Finally, I should like to add that we should emphasise the role of the consular services of such new representations."
"Small countries do not have much money and do not have representations all over Europe and all over the world, which is why they have high hopes of this service."
"We, in Slovenia, have had a good experience of working in collaboration with Austrian diplomats."
"Commissioner, we would like that cooperation to continue to act as a kind of template."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that the European Union is committed in everything it does to compliance with human rights and, obviously, these also include the rights of women, as already mentioned here."
"I myself believe that the common European External Action Service will definitely improve our opportunities to take human rights into account in all our work, though this will not happen by itself."
"I would like to hear you describe how you intend to ensure that human rights and aspirations for equality are mainstreamed into this forthcoming External Action Service."
"I will give you an example: not all EU delegations at present comply with the seven human rights guidelines we have agreed on together."
"Now we have the opportunity, through training programmes, for example, to raise the profile of these important matters."
"Mr Brok's report also mentions training."
"I would therefore be interested in hearing your views on these matters."
"(HU) Mr President, the question that is being asked here at the moment, and what we are actually talking about, is whether, while progressing along the path determined by the Treaty of Lisbon, there will be a superstate initiative or 27 countries will have close institutional cooperation."
"Constitutional courts are now debating this issue as well and want to make a decision."
"In Strasbourg, prior to the first sitting, the EU flag was raised and the EU anthem was played, along with a military parade."
"A state has an anthem and a flag, cooperation does not."
"We have heard here about us sending an ambassador to represent us around the world."
"We also hear about Europe speaking with one voice."
"We do not agree with this."
"We envisage a different path for Europe's future."
"This does not make us paranoid, as those preaching tolerance are saying."
"We still want Europe, it just happens to be a different Europe to what most people want."
"Mr President, because the speaker was so kind as to agree to answer a question, I am going to ask one."
"Real Madrid, which is a Spanish football club, has got a flag and an anthem."
"Do you believe it is a state?"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"(HU) A flag belonging to other states is not usually raised amidst a military parade, as in this case, while playing the anthem."
"If you believe that Europe operates like a football team, this means that you have your own individual view on this."
"Europe should not be a club of fanatics rallying around one flag, even though you might be an ardent fan, but it should be a team representing different perspectives instead."
"Mr President, the discussion on the European External Action Service is taking place at a time when the need for a long-term EU strategy on how to work with the other parts of the globe in the dramatically changing world has become urgent."
"We need bold strategies, vision and actions, as the emerging global powers are modernising more quickly than Europe ever did and are becoming more and more assertive."
"Our geopolitical strategic thinking in foreign policy cannot be limited to climate change and energy security."
"One of the three institutions that will, in practice, be active in foreign policy - President of the Council, President of the Commission and High Representative - must have the geopolitical strategic competences assigned to it and not only short-term fixing of emerging problems, which leads to lowest common denominator-based foreign policy."
"In my view, the natural candidate for these strategic competences is the High Representative, drawing on the competences and expertise of the European External Action Service."
"(BG) The creation of the European External Action Service and a successful start to its operation will mark a major political success in the European Union on its way to achieving the goal of having a proper European common foreign and security policy."
"This would allow Europe to truly speak with one voice."
"It will be possible to provide an answer to the famous anecdotal question asked by Henry Kissinger: 'Who do I call if I want to call Europe?' because Europe's telephone number will be the telephone number of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"At present, in order to find out what Europe's position is, we need to know 27 telephone numbers, one for each Member State."
"It goes without saying that for this service to be able to start operating, the prospective High Representative must submit here in our Parliament his or her proposal for setting up the service."
"I also hope that this person will take into consideration Mr Brok's report and will have an equal and fair representation of all Member States, in particular, new Member States."
"Mr President, it is really interesting to hear how some Members are very irritated by this famous one voice being challenged and the whole status quo being challenged."
"I call upon and invite the citizens of Europe who elected us to be here to listen to this conversation through the transparency of the Internet and give their opinions about all these things we are talking about."
"I wanted to raise another issue, however, I recalled during the discussion when Mrs Ferrero-Waldner visited the Israeli Government during the terrible bloodshed of the Gaza war."
"I will never ever forget, Commissioner, how you hugged and kissed the members of the Israeli Government during that terrible time."
"How can I be sure that if this resolution is accepted nobody is going to hug and kiss war criminals on my behalf?"
"(RO) I would first of all like to congratulate Elmar Brok for drafting this report."
"As the previous speaker also said, it is three decades since the US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, asked the question: 'Who do I call if I want to call Europe?'"
"Creating the post of High Representative and an external service will allow the European Union to answer this question."
"With these functions available, I believe that European diplomacy should be able to play a more active and decisive role in defending the EU's basic interests, which also concerns energy security."
"I welcome the fact that the High Representative and the heads of the diplomatic missions should engage in permanent dialogue with the European Parliament."
"With regard to the deployment of staff as part of the external service, I believe that, apart from the fact that the relevant employees must have excellent knowledge and skills, consideration must also be given without fail to ensuring proper, proportional representation for Member States."
"(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to express my sincere thanks for this splendid, factual report."
"Thanks to establishment of the European External Action Service, the European Union will be able to have an active presence in the international arena as a creator of international policy."
"This is extremely important."
"Of course, we all agree that the question of the quality of services is principally the responsibility of the Commission and the Member States, and that in this matter, cooperation is needed between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"However, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, on the basis of her contact with the European Parliament, she envisages a practical possibility of using our work in the form of active cooperation, for example, in interparliamentary delegations."
"I think there are many forums where the High Representative and the European External Action Service could cooperate actively with Parliament, including by means of delegations."
"Are appropriate preparations being made in this regard?"
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I also want to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"I wish to emphasise, however, that in order to make the European External Action Service work, we must also pay genuine attention to the small Member States and each country's special characteristics in the area of foreign and security policy."
"It is only by doing that and by having this debate that we will be able to make the EEAS a viable entity."
"It is important that the report also mentioned the importance of transparency and democracy."
"In addition, it is my view that we should stress the importance specifically of the issues of soft security in connection with the EEAS."
"The European Union was created on the basis of peace and stability, and we can promote these globally, in particular, by means of humanitarian aid, development cooperation, crisis management and international trade."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I found it interesting that some of the honourable Members who speak so warmly of democracy cannot accept that the Lisbon Treaty has been democratically adopted by 26 Parliaments and one referendum."
"(Applause)"
"There is one man's signature remaining, I agree, but I feel very confident that the Treaty will enter into force very soon, and that we should have the External Action Service in place."
"That is a good thing."
"It is supported in Member States, in national parliaments and, honourable Members - if you look at Eurostat surveys for instance - also by citizens all around the European Union."
"This is because they think - like we do, like I do, like most people here do - that it is important for the European Union to be able to act in a more coherent and stronger way if we want to promote our values and work towards peace and democracy all over the world."
"We should, of course, avoid bureaucracy and duplication but, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said, we are building a new body."
"It is sui generis so we have to find ways to develop it."
"What the Coreper is discussing in cooperation with the Council, the Commission and with Members of the European Parliament - Mr Brok and others, and I personally have also had several discussions with Mr Buzek in order to try to keep Parliament informed - is the general framework and the tasks of the External Action Service."
"That now has to be discussed politically, and it will be the task of the High Representative to then develop the details."
"That will be done in close cooperation and in dialogue with the European Parliament."
"I am quite convinced of that."
"Of course, there are still issues to be resolved."
"What is important is that the High Representative has the instruments to execute his or her tasks in the most efficient way."
"That means that he or she has to be responsible for the EAS administrative budget, but also for the appointing authorities."
"Obviously, any legal solution that we choose - and there are discussions still to be held here - must respect all the budgetary rules in place, thereby ensuring appropriate accountability."
"The Council might not agree with all the details in the Brok report, but I think it is a very valuable contribution to this discussion."
"I hope it will get broad support in this Parliament."
"I would like to thank Mr Brok for the work he has done and for the debate here in the Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, again I want to say we are not deciding whether the External Action Service will be there or not: it is already there with the Lisbon Treaty."
"As my colleague just said, and I too am confident, the Lisbon Treaty will be in force fairly soon."
"I shall now comment on a few things that have come up in the discussion, and I think it is worthwhile taking them up."
"First of all, we, as the Commission, are committed to making the EEAS a success."
"It needs to be a shared enterprise with full buy-in of all the EU institutions and the Member States from the very start."
"From my own experience as Commissioner for External Relations, I think a lot of things will be done in different ways in future."
"I can see the need for the High Representative Vice-President to have a degree of managerial and budgetary autonomy."
"At the same time, it is clear that the EEAS will need very close links with a wide range of Commission services and therefore, it is important that we work together."
"I support Parliament's objectives of ensuring transparent and accountable budgetary arrangements for the EEAS."
"That is also clear so I think that we are looking forward to working towards the right formula on that."
"Second, under the Treaty, the political accountability for the European Parliament is primarily through the President of the Commission and the High Representative Vice-President and other Members of the Commission."
"We welcome the clear signal in Mr Brok's report that the High Representative Vice-President should be the appointing authority for the EEAS and the senior delegation staff."
"In the new system, heads of delegation and other senior EEAS staff will be EU officials under the Staff Regulations, subject to defined appointment procedures and obligations of independence."
"We would have questions about the implications of singling out one group for EP hearings in this way. Even if it were a question of hearings only for a more political post, the same consideration would apply."
"I think this is certainly not in line with the practice in Member States."
"Again, we understand, however, that Parliament has an interest in having an in-depth exchange, be it formal or be it informal, with key senior officials in the EEAS and the delegations."
"I think this could be done after somebody has been appointed; then they should go to Parliament and discuss things with Parliament."
"I have also noted with great interest and pleasure that the question of human rights and the question of women's rights have been mentioned."
"I can only tell you that all the EU institutions are committed to gender mainstreaming."
"This will also apply in the EEAS, but appointments also have to be on merit, so merit and gender mainstreaming have to go together."
"I wanted to quickly comment on the Israeli Government and my trip to the Middle East."
"After the Gaza conflict, it was very important to obtain a ceasefire."
"I tried to contribute to the first ceasefire and I think it was my intervention in particular that made it possible to open humanitarian corridors and set times to deliver humanitarian goods at that very difficult and decisive moment."
"Finally, on the matter of delegations, as I said before: they are open already."
"The European parliamentary delegations that you mentioned are already open for Commissioners or for Council members to go there, but it also depends on the time schedule."
"The situation should be the same in the future."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks that have been made here on a common European foreign and security policy belong in the past."
"In opinion polls, 70% of the citizens of Europe say that they want a stronger common foreign and security policy, because they know that this is the only way of keeping the peace in Europe and of looking after the interests of Europe throughout the world."
"The statements that you have made belong to the past."
"These are the sort of statements that have led Europe into war and we want to put an end to them."
"We would also like to state that we want this foreign policy to strengthen Europe's ability to act."
"I would also like to say explicitly that foreign policy is not the job of parliaments."
"Operational foreign policy must be the responsibility of the executive."
"This is the case in all national states."
"However, this means that parliaments - and in this case the European Parliament - must have full rights of control."
"It must be made clear how this applies to the budget, in which areas there is a right to information and where there is genuine accountability."
"I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to include in their documents less information about organigrams and about the members of the national delegations who will be appointed to specific posts."
"Instead, they must describe the rights of the Parliament in these COREPER documents and not simply say that the rights of Parliament must be maintained full stop."
"I believe that some action must be taken here."
"In addition, I am of the opinion that the High Representative or Vice-President, who has yet to be appointed, must be involved in drawing up the proposals and must not be presented with a fait accompli."
"This must also be taken into account."
"Mrs Malmström, it would generate a lot of confidence if you would refer to the High Representative in future as the High Representative or Vice-President of the Commission."
"Then we would all be talking about the same subject and this would be helpful in establishing that we really are speaking about the same thing."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 22 October 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us."
"I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available."
"On the basis of this work, the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service."
"The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this: we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player, and we want this to happen on a consensual basis, that is to say, with the involvement and the support of all three institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model, and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and, in particular, the committee that I chair, in the negotiations from the outset, in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy."
"The creation of the European External Action Service is an absolute must in order to improve the effectiveness of the EU's external action."
"The purpose of this is to promote a much more consistent foreign policy and raise the EU's profile at an international level."
"However, achieving these objectives depends on how we organise this service."
"The report contains a number of particularly important proposals."
"We need an organisation which is as streamlined as possible and avoids any duplication."
"This is why I support the merger of Commission delegations in third countries, of the Council's liaison offices and the offices of the EU Special Representatives, as well as the creation of 'EU embassies'."
"From an efficiency perspective, I also find it an interesting proposal that these delegations will adopt certain consular functions, such as dealing with Schengen visas."
"I wish to stress the need for standard training for staff so that we can really have a professional service which meets the EU's needs."
"Setting up a European diplomatic college seems an ideal solution to me for providing diplomatic staff with training based on common standards in order to guarantee consistency for the EEAS."
"Indeed, in the future, a European diplomatic career could become just as attractive as a diplomatic career for a Member State."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last spring, the European Parliament adopted the report by Mr Dehaene on the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on the EU's institutional balance."
"In it, Parliament requested that future nominations for top posts in the EU should also take account of the gender equality angle."
"Now, just a few months later, the European Parliament is adopting an even more stringent position in favour of the implementation of equality."
"Parliament's position on equality is therefore clear."
"Vice-President of the European Commission, Margot Wallström, has been proactive in matters to do with equality."
"José Manuel Barroso, the Commission's re-elected President, has also promised to be sympathetic to the notion of equality when he forms the new Commission."
"The Member States, however, are in a crucial position here."
"I am convinced that we will find suitable Commission candidates in the Member States of the European Union, both men and women. Thank you."
"The Treaty of Lisbon promised to bring about all sorts of changes."
"The EU was to become more responsive and more democratic, the European Parliament would have more powers of codecision and the citizens would have their EU referendum."
"However, Member States are, in fact, being put under pressure by the threat of commissioners being removed."
"Now is the time for the EU to show its goodwill and finally to ask the people about the accession of Turkey."
"However, referendums seem only to be held in order to be ignored."
"It is also difficult to work out how the EU is to become more responsive if the responsibilities of the newly created posts are only outlined in the treaty."
"Conflicts are as inevitable in this area as they are in the new External Action Service whose rights of access have not yet been clarified."
"Our extraordinary budget is already becoming increasingly costly and covers an increasingly dense network of EU agencies which inevitably involve duplication of effort and overlapping authority."
"Therefore, it is important to maintain the balance so that the new system, on the one hand, does not result in any duplication, but allows synergies to be exploited, and so that, on the other hand, parliamentary control cannot be circumvented, the Member States cannot be blocked and national authority remains unchanged."
"Along with all of this, the new body must have the necessary authority to complete its tasks and to work efficiently with Europe's strategic partners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of the European External Action Service is an exceptional project and particularly worthy of support."
"It is intended to assist the EU High Representative but, at the same time, we must remember to ensure a proper level of qualification, as well as its institutional and national representative character."
"Recruitment of people to the service should be done taking special care to maintain principles of transparency and equality."
"It is also worth noting the fact that the European External Action Service will extend the possibility of receiving diplomatic assistance, because every EU citizen will be able to apply for this."
"This is a de facto extension of the present possibility of applying for assistance to the foreign service of another Member State, if the Member State of origin does not have a diplomatic or consular office in a particular country."
"The European External Action Service should also represent added value because of the synergy of its three basic components - services which have their origins in the present European Commission, the Council and the Member States."
"In my opinion, the EEAS should recruit candidates from all three sources."
"This will ensure its professionalism, effectiveness and unique character."
"Effectiveness will also be achieved through the large number of European Union representations which will arise from the transformation of today's Commission representations."
"With reference to Mr Grzyb's speech, I agree with him that the creation of a European diplomatic college could be obviated by making use of national and regional centres which are already renowned across Europe for the professional training they provide for future diplomats."
"Preparation of the TEC meeting and the EU/USA Summit (2 and 3 November 2009) - Transatlantic judicial and police cooperation (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on:"
"1."
"Preparation of the TEC meeting and the ΕU/USA Summit (2 and 3 November 2009) and"
"2."
"Transatlantic judicial and police cooperation."
"Mr President, honourable Members, as you know, our relations with the US and the transatlantic cooperation between the US and the EU are extremely important."
"It is a cornerstone of EU foreign policy, founded on the values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and international law, which is something that unites us."
"The new administration in the United States has shown great interest in deepening and extending links with us in Europe."
"We will have the first Transatlantic Economic Council with President Obama's administration on 26-27 October."
"Shortly after that, on 3 November, there will be a summit between the EU and the US."
"These are two important opportunities to strengthen our relations."
"Today's debate is therefore very important."
"I would like to highlight a number of areas on which we are cooperating and in connection with which we hope to be able to achieve results and closer relations during the summit."
"On the issue of the climate, we welcome the higher ambitions on the US's part."
"We must work together with the American administration to achieve a comprehensive, globally binding agreement in Copenhagen."
"We call on the US to set targets that are comparable to those set by the EU."
"The United States and the EU must be prepared, together, to support climate measures such as emissions reduction, adaptation, financing and other support for developing countries."
"Another important issue is, of course, the financial and economic crisis."
"Very close cooperation will be needed in order to follow up the agreements that we reached at the G20 summit and to restore confidence in the financial markets."
"Together, we will work to conclude the Doha round with a positive result in 2010, because this is extremely important in the efforts to promote recovery and combat protectionism."
"We will, of course, also discuss a number of regional issues, for example, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, the Middle East, Russia and the Western Balkans."
"We have regular and ever closer cooperation in connection with crisis management, which found expression, for example, in the US's participation in a civil CSDP task, the Eulex mission in Kosovo."
"We are also cooperating on energy issues, which is something that needs to be strengthened now, and we hope to be able to establish a special energy council between the EU and the US at ministerial level."
"There is interest on both sides in deepening cooperation on domestic and legal matters."
"I will come back to this in a moment, as I understand that the debates have been combined."
"With regard to non-proliferation and disarmament, cooperation between the EU and the American administration has gained new momentum, and Barack Obama is giving priority to this issue."
"We hope that this can be reflected in a new joint declaration on non-proliferation and disarmament in connection with the summit in November."
"Both sides of the Atlantic are interested in strengthening our cooperation with regard to development."
"The EU and the US are, of course, responsible for the vast majority of all the world's development aid."
"The forthcoming summit is therefore an excellent opportunity to discuss this and any other relevant issues at the highest level."
"The Swedish Presidency is very pleased to have the opportunity to represent the EU."
"I would like to say a few words about the economic partnership and the Transatlantic Economic Council, the TEC."
"This will provide us with a mechanism at the highest possible level to speed up current negotiations and establish new areas for regulatory cooperation."
"We need to draw up a work programme for the TEC that can be established next year."
"That will give us a forum for cooperation, where we can deal with issues relating to globalisation and rapid technical changes."
"Up to now, it has been an important forum but it could, of course, be better, not least when it comes to the broader strategic issues relating to the transatlantic economy and common economic challenges."
"The Transatlantic Economic Council is even more important today in light of the financial crisis."
"Allow me now to say a few words about legal and police cooperation."
"For a while now, we have had cooperation with the United States in this area, which is reflected in a number of agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance which will enter into force in a few months."
"We often discuss this with the European Parliament, which I know is an active and committed partner on these matters - often a critical partner, too, which is a good thing."
"In this regard, I only need remind you of the debate on passenger name records, for example."
"Once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the European Parliament's influence on, and involvement in, these matters will increase."
"We are currently working on what is referred to as the Washington Statement, which will describe the situation with regard to legal and domestic policy issues and the cooperation in this area between the EU and the US."
"This statement must be meaningful and it must be followed by concrete measures."
"What we need is not more elegant words, but rather cooperation that is tangible and active."
"Naturally, we need to establish our common values, namely democracy and the rule of law, along with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"We are, of course, interested in cooperating in all areas that constitute a threat to these common values."
"We are seeking early consultation between the two parties when political incidents occur that may affect the other party."
"We are emphasising our common ambitions to be active in international forums to achieve full implementation of multilateral obligations."
"We are cooperating with regard to increasing the security of travel documents and the introduction of biometric passports as an international standard."
"An important example is the agreement on airline passenger data."
"Together, we will ensure that the agreement works, but at the same time, the privacy of individuals must be protected and the systems of the different countries must be respected."
"The list of areas of cooperation is a long one."
"Let me name just a few: people trafficking, the sexual exploitation of children, the drugs trade, economic crime, IT crime, corruption, the confiscation of aids to, and the profits from, crime and the fight against terrorism."
"This all requires joint and, to a certain degree, coordinated efforts."
"We have been working to improve legal cooperation with regard to detecting, investigating and prosecuting cross-border criminals and terrorists."
"We look forward to the agreement between the EU and the US on extradition and mutual legal assistance entering into force at the beginning of next year."
"The agreement has now been transposed in all 27 EU Member States and a joint working group has been set up between the EU and the US to ensure that the agreement is implemented."
"Seminars are being planned to bring the players involved closer together and to help them monitor the implementation."
"Finally, I would like to mention three more points."
"The first concerns the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"This is extremely important."
"The fight against cross-border crime and terrorism often requires the exchange of personal data which, to some degree, forces us to make certain concessions with regard to fundamental freedoms and rights."
"This must be counterbalanced by the fundamental and rigorous protection of personal data."
"The cooperation and dialogue in this area is continuing and should be stepped up."
"My second point relates to critical infrastructure."
"We need to cooperate with one another in connection with the damage that could be done to critical infrastructure in the event of a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or attacks on our information systems."
"That could have devastating consequences."
"There is huge scope for cooperation in this area."
"Thirdly, the EU and the US have undertaken to work on the basis of the principles of freedom, democracy and justice."
"We are determined to promote these principles throughout the world."
"We do this whenever we work together and when we work in international forums such as the United Nations."
"The cooperation between liaison officers and delegations has proved fruitful, for example, in the Western Balkans and in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"This cooperation must be improved."
"The various measures within this cooperation can complement each other."
"We also need to coordinate our technical assistance better."
"We will continue our donor cooperation, the cooperation on aid and the operational cooperation in respect of Latin America and West Africa to help in the fight against the drugs trade and to be able to meet other challenges."
"I am very pleased that the American administration is showing such a strong interest in cooperating with us."
"It is in our interests to take up this offer of working to safeguard our values and our interests in a constructive dialogue, a cooperation which will hopefully lead to some tangible results in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in my remarks, I shall touch upon the forthcoming EU-US Summit that will be an important milestone in our transatlantic partnership, as well as addressing certain EU-US aspects, particularly on climate change negotiations under way and also some critical GLS issues."
"The change in the US Administration in January has had a very significant impact on EU-US relations, and our partnership has got off to a good start."
"I would say we have re-energised our relations and I am convinced that the Lisbon Treaty, once in force, will also contribute towards the further strengthening of this vital relationship by providing the European Union with an even stronger foreign policy identity."
"That is also what our friends in Washington expect."
"But let us be also clear. Our aspiration for a true partnership of equals with the United States also means that Europeans must be willing and able to deliver."
"I would say that it is a dual momentum, internal and external, that makes the summit in Washington so important."
"The first formal summit with President Obama took place after our informal meeting in Prague this spring."
"Now the preparations for the Washington Summit are in full swing."
"We are working with the US side on delivering tangible results in priority areas."
"The global economy and climate change are likely to be the two major areas of focus of the summit discussion, in addition to a number of key foreign policy challenges."
"On the economy, the focus in Washington will be on joint efforts to combat the economic and financial crisis and securing a sustainable global economic recovery to secure jobs and create growth."
"We will move further on governance issues for the global economy, notably on financial regulation and a timely follow-up to the G20 Pittsburgh Summit."
"The Commission will also emphasise our joint interest in countering protectionist tendencies and we will call on the US to renew efforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful end."
"Secondly, on climate change, we as the European Union will encourage the US to go to the Copenhagen conference with ambitious objectives to reach a sound global agreement, and we will also engage with the US to make progress on establishing a cap-and-trade system across the Atlantic."
"Thirdly, on foreign policy, we will, of course, also discuss with the US how to meet urgent foreign policy challenges."
"Here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process, on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran, and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the compact in Afghanistan, which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there."
"I will have a separate foreign policy meeting with Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Bildt to discuss these matters in greater detail."
"Furthermore, I expect the summit also to adopt a declaration on non-proliferation and disarmament, taking forward EU-US cooperation in many of the areas identified by President Obama in his speeches in Prague and New York. This initiative, which carries strategic importance in itself, is indicative of the renewed US commitment towards effective multilateralism, which the European Union has every intention of supporting and consolidating."
"Last but not least, a further major summit outcome will be the creation of a new EU-US Energy Council which will have its first meeting on 4 November."
"On the EU side, the Council will be chaired by myself, my colleagues, Commissioners Piebalgs and Potočnik, and the Presidency, and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Chu."
"The Council will look at global energy security, energy markets and product regulation, at new technologies and research."
"In short, it will provide added value in a policy field, the importance of which is obvious."
"Now there is also a new Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC)."
"That will be complementary to the Energy Council, which we will re-energise as well."
"The TEC meets in Washington next Tuesday - so before the Energy Council - and its outcome will obviously feed into the summit talks as well."
"A promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation."
"We will discuss policy approaches early on, so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road."
"It goes without saying that we need such cooperation more than ever."
"The needed coherent response to the financial crisis is the best example for it."
"We will also explore whether we can intensify this forum of cooperation for nanomaterial health care-related information."
"Upon a US initiative, we also intend to launch closer cooperation in the area of innovation."
"Both sides recognise that enhancing the innovative potential of our industries and our workforces is essential for the creation of jobs and growth and therefore for a successful emergence of the coming crisis."
"And the Commission, of course, will also repeat our European concerns on some critical issues such as securing trade, potential distortions of competition from State aid and procurement policy in the US."
"Finally, we as the Commission have also, from the very beginning, strongly relied on the European Parliament's support for the TEC process, and we are grateful for this."
"So rest assured that we will very much support the initiatives by the European Parliament's delegations for relations with the USA to strengthen parliamentary involvement in TEC matters on both sides of the Atlantic."
"We would like to consolidate the TEC's role as a bilateral forum to address both day-to-day and strategic issues regarding transatlantic trade and investment."
"And importantly, the TEC will have reached out to the transatlantic legislators' dialogue and civil society stakeholders, too, so clearly we need the expertise and political thrust of legislators to tap the full potential of the transatlantic market place."
"My colleague has already mentioned that GLS will also be very important."
"There will be a Troika meeting on GLS affairs on 27 and 28 October in Washington, in the framework of our cooperation on justice, freedom and security."
"Vice-President Barrot will represent the Commission."
"We are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas."
"In the Washington meeting, there will be the opportunity formally to exchange the instruments of ratification of the extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements so that they can enter into force in early 2010."
"These agreements will strengthen our efforts in fighting crime in today's globalised world."
"On another critical matter close to the hearts of the citizens, we certainly need to make further progress, as was mentioned."
"We will reiterate the call for visa-free travel to the US for all EU citizens; we will express our concern over the prospect of a fee for the electronic system for travel authorisation as the de facto new tourist tax; and we will once again remind the US of the need to lift the restrictions on travellers with HIV/AIDS under the US visa waiver programme, as you have mentioned."
"Finally, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be travelling to Washington around the time of the ministerial meeting, so we trust they will also be able to convey the same messages."
"Vice-President Barrot is also ready to meet the Committee on Civil Liberties delegation while in Washington."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, I have just noticed that gender mainstreaming has become a feature of this House."
"We must be aware that the issue of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) is a very important one and that the body which was established a few years ago needs a new driving force, because we are in a transition period with a new administration in the US and soon a new Commission."
"I hope that the meeting next Tuesday will ensure that the TEC continues and that it has the appropriate spirit."
"A transatlantic market with no trade barriers would result in economic growth of 3.5% in the US and Europe and 1.5% worldwide."
"In the context of this economic crisis, this issue is very closely linked with jobs."
"For this reason, we should make the most of this opportunity and explain in public statements that we are taking this initiative seriously."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, we should also make sure that security policy in the field of energy is handled by the new energy security council and that the regulatory issues are dealt with in the TEC."
"It is important that these two areas are not mixed together in order to prevent duplication and to ensure that we have a solution at the end of the day."
"This involves, in particular, the question of the legislators."
"It will not be possible to remove barriers without the participation of the European Parliament and the US Congress, because 80% of the regulations are enshrined in law."
"For this reason, the administration cannot achieve this on its own."
"There is one final comment I would like to make about the summit."
"Climate change, Afghanistan, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction and disarmament are all important issues which offer new opportunities as a result of the new administration."
"I would like to wish you success in ensuring that all of this is included and I hope that the new Nobel prize winner, in cooperation with the European Union, will achieve major success for all of us in these areas."
"Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, the fact that Mr Obama and the new majority in Congress are presenting us with a significant opportunity to intensify our cooperation, in particular, with regard to the common transatlantic market, has already been mentioned."
"However, this should not be a common market for deregulation, but a common market based on the foundations or on the principles of a social market economy, with sensible and appropriate regulations where these are required."
"Mr Brok is absolutely right that this must, of course, have a legislative basis, regardless of whether we are discussing the regulation of the financial markets or environmental and energy policy regulations."
"Taking a joint approach in this area would make a major contribution towards shaping global relationships."
"One area which has already been touched on and which we could discuss this morning is the central issue of climate policy."
"Many of us will be in Washington in the next few days, where we will have the opportunity to hold discussions with our colleagues from Congress."
"Although the legislation concerning climate policy has not yet been passed, the representatives of the US Government are at least partly authorised to make binding undertakings, even if the details cannot be finalised until after the US legislative process has been completed."
"It is essential that Copenhagen is a success."
"It is not the end of a process, but it is an important step in the process of achieving a common climate policy."
"We must all ensure that Copenhagen is a success."
"It can only be successful if we have binding climate policy objectives."
"Finally - and this has also already been mentioned - regardless of our friendship and mutual affection and regardless of our good relationship, there are certain things that we cannot accept. These include the repeated protectionist measures, for example, in the market for defence equipment, the discriminatory visa policy aimed at some Member States and the visa charges demanded by the US which have already been referred to."
"It is important that we talk to the US from a position of equality."
"It is important to establish a partnership, but also to explain what we cannot accept, which in this case, is a policy that discriminates against Europeans."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I strongly welcome the fact that this resolution calls for a strengthened strategic partnership between the EU and the US as a cornerstone of EU external policy."
"It also rightly reiterates the role of an integrated transatlantic market by 2015."
"We must not let the trees of myriad disagreements on specific issues obscure the wood of an overwhelming interest in common values and objectives, and action on promotion of democracy and human rights, resolution of conflicts and protection against security threats among others."
"On the economic side, the ALDE Group has emphasised the need to avoid regulatory arbitrage in the financial sector and to address issues such as 'too big to fail' institutions."
"We have put in an amendment to paragraph 39 since, as far as I can see, there simply was no G2 leaders' agreement to work on a financial transaction or Tobin tax, so it is absurd to welcome such an agreement, even if we have already done so, erroneously, in the G20 resolution."
"The ALDE Group also calls for deletion of paragraph 38, which appears to seek the abolition of intellectual property rights."
"But, as Mrs Malmström has explained, a large part of the transatlantic relationship relates to justice and security matters."
"The ALDE Group fully supports close cooperation in this area but it must respect fundamental rights, including privacy, and be progressed within a democratic and transparent framework."
"In that respect, it is a pity that MEPs have not been consulted on the joint statement to be agreed next week - especially as, with the Lisbon Treaty, almost all of these matters come within codecision."
"It is puzzling why the Commission and Council are promoting a new agreement on access to SWIFT financial data on EU citizens when the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement allows for specific requests."
"I would like an answer on that."
"Finally, it is a pity that the new context of justice and extradition cooperation nonetheless permits the completely unjustified extradition from the UK of Gary McKinnon, a computer hacker who has Asperger's syndrome, rather than his being prosecuted in the UK."
"Very finally, I fully support what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said about visa-free travel for all EU citizens and we are very critical of a 'visa lite' fee for the ESTA."
"Madam President, in her speech, Mrs Malmström said that action was needed, not just fine words."
"I can tell you that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely, since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us, on the one hand, to Copenhagen and, on the other, to the reform of the international financial system."
"On this last point, the casino has now reopened, banks' profits are once again reaching historic levels - USD 437 billion in profits for the US banks - and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago."
"We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit, which is intended to show that, in both the US and Europe, the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present."
"In order to achieve this, we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points."
"The first is combating tax havens, and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches."
"The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion."
"We therefore wanted to emphasise this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit."
"The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions."
"When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax."
"A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework."
"The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November."
"My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama's foot."
"President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority."
"The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions."
"Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations."
"This is our responsibility."
"We must do it before the summit."
"Madam President, deepening relations between the United States and the European Union should be the foundation of EU external policy."
"After all, the United States has been our closest ally for years."
"Currently, many challenges are before us, which we must face up to together, shoulder to shoulder with Washington."
"In the area of security, we are troubled by the attitude of Iran and the worsening situation in Afghanistan."
"A little closer to our borders, Russia is becoming an increasingly unpredictable and authoritarian neighbour, and the Kremlin is exerting neoimperialistic pressure on the countries which lie just across its borders."
"In order to defend and remain faithful to the values which are common to America and Europe, we must always speak with one voice when we have to deal with cases of violations of human rights and threats to citizens' fundamental freedoms."
"We must be united in defence of our security."
"We must not forget that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the foundation of our transatlantic relations."
"This is why the area of security, freedom and democracy should be extended to include those European countries which increase Euroatlantic security."
"It is essential for active strengthening of ties with the United States to be a priority for the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, in the current economic crisis the newly-elected Parliament is entitled to up-to-date information which is as precise as possible regarding the structure of the plan for a large transatlantic market and regarding the deregulation objectives that this involves in the economic and financial spheres, in contrast to the dream set out by some of our fellow Members."
"Is this large deregulated market to be implemented by 2010 or 2015?"
"Has it been confirmed?"
"Personally, I think it would be very detrimental for Europe, given the miserable state of the fundamental elements of the US economy and the refusal by the US to set its financial house in order, in addition to reasons of principle that lead me to oppose the idea that this partnership should be, as many of you have said, the cornerstone of the European Union's policy."
"This consideration also leads me to ask what measures will be taken to combat the collapse of the dollar and the risk that it poses to Europe and the rest of the world."
"Why has the proposal for a common world currency, put forward by China for the benefit of the stability of the world economy, been rejected without serious examination?"
"I want to warn against an outmoded enthusiasm for Atlantic cooperation, which ends up being a very archaic conformism, at this point in the world's history where we need, more than ever, to affirm an existence that is independent of the wishes of the United States of America."
"Madam President, regarding the joint fight against terrorism, as a criminal and human rights lawyer, let me make a suggestion."
"I think it would be very important and useful to put together a joint working group of experts, academics, practising lawyers and so on, drawing conclusions from the often very painful experiences of the post 9/11 era, where human rights have been suspended in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"I come from a country where, in the last three years, the government has been suspending human rights and sending people to prison completely without any foundation."
"In this day and age, they do it in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"We have 16 very probably political prisoners in prison, charged with terrorism, without any evidence whatsoever."
"Suspended human rights, habeas corpus, right of defence, prisoners' rights: I know what I am talking about."
"We have to be very careful when we talk about the fight against terrorism and we have to do it in a very professional and very careful way."
"(ES) Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union's most important relationship."
"The United States holds a key position in the world and the European Union is increasingly becoming a global actor."
"We can, and should, undertake many things together."
"First of all, we should take a leading role in creating a new, global world, featuring new challenges and the emergence of new actors."
"We need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanisms."
"This is the right time to undertake such action."
"We have a government in Washington which favours multilateralism, a European Union strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and we are witnessing the emergence of a new world which we want to shape together."
"The resolution we will adopt tomorrow specifically supports the strengthening of the institutional mechanisms, something which Parliament called for in its resolution of 26 March."
"The decision to create the Transatlantic Economic Council two years ago was the right one."
"However, in today's world, we also need to develop excellent coordination in terms of policies and security."
"We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security."
"That is why this House, this Parliament, supported the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council which, in the future, must include the energy council that you wish to establish at the next summit."
"The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year."
"If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players."
"It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States."
"We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty."
"The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades."
"Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation."
"In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States."
"To summarise, a key issue for the upcoming summit, in my opinion, should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations, including at institutional level."
"Madam President, the transatlantic relations that are crucial for both the EU and the US have been seriously tested in recent years."
"Now, with a new Administration in the White House which is redefining US priorities, and France back into the NATO military structure, the perspective is better."
"Personally, I consider that the time is now ripe for a substantive evaluation of transatlantic relations to give them the solid basis they deserve to withstand the current common challenges posed by the international environment - energy, climate change, emerging new powers, the financial and economic crisis, and terrorism."
"This time we should go beyond superficial policy differences and evaluate our deeper common interests which, until now, have simply been taken for granted."
"The truth is that, without such a profound joint evaluation, we in the West could lose the initiative to other centres of power, who will not hesitate to shape the world according to their interests - not ours."
"Security in Europe, for instance, is one such common interest and therefore stands at the heart of transatlantic relations."
"Even if, for now, war on the continent is not a serious proposition, the culmination of some current negative trends could bring back that possibility if we fail to respond properly."
"Progress is not irreversible, as we all know so well in central Europe."
"That is why, before considering a proposal to re-evaluate the current security architecture of the continent, we should try to have definite answers as to the continuation of US involvement, the future of NATO and the role expected of the EU after the Lisbon Treaty comes into force."
"If Europe wants to realise its ambition to be a true player in world politics, it should eliminate such differences between its members, thus trying to motivate them equally around true common economic interests."
"(DE) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the fourth meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council represents the ideal opportunity for this forum to turn over a new page."
"The TEC must be more ambitious."
"Both parties to the transatlantic dialogue agree that overcoming the economic crisis and combating climate change are our overriding priorities."
"Now it is a question of agreeing on a specific agenda for the TEC which reflects these priorities."
"Collaborating on innovations for the development of low-carbon economies and energy efficient societies is particularly important."
"In addition, it is also important to involve various stakeholders more closely, such as the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a forum consisting of 80 consumer organisations."
"These organisations could help to make consumer protection a central theme in the dialogue about regulation of the financial markets."
"The objective of establishing a common transatlantic market by 2015 may be too ambitious, but it must be judged on the basis of the fact that it will improve the lives of people on both sides of the Atlantic."
"This is why the Greens are in favour of a transatlantic new deal."
"Madam President, I agree with those speakers who said we have a real opportunity in front of us with a new US Administration in place."
"Three quick points."
"Firstly, we seem to have evolved into a situation where we have a huge number of subjects which are discussed between the EU and the US, but no strategic dialogue, and yet they tell me in Washington that the US and China have a much greater strategic dialogue than between us across the Atlantic."
"Is it not time at this summit to say that we want a strategic dialogue for a strategic partnership?"
"Secondly, regarding the point on protectionism on the TEC, it is quite clear that the biggest danger in the next 12 months is closing markets rather than opening ones, and yet we have the transatlantic market which is, as Mr Brok said, the biggest opportunity we have for generating growth on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Is it not time to make the transatlantic market a major part of trade development, rather than putting it to one side as a regulatory issue?"
"It is actually a major opener."
"Lastly, it is disappointing that we have no study and no road map as promised by Mr Verheugen."
"The study was paid for by Parliament."
"If you want Parliament to cooperate on saying how we now need to see how to open markets, please release this report, as the resolution says, by 15 November."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you believe that the European Union needs partners, as all the previous speakers have said, then this becomes particularly clear in the area of the economy."
"The transatlantic market has a trade volume of around EUR 2 billion per day."
"This makes it obvious how important the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is."
"It also becomes clear that free trade agreements are important and, above all, that we must focus more closely on the transatlantic partnership."
"I am sometimes concerned about what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic when I look at the new President."
"He will find the time to accept the Nobel prize in Oslo, but it was difficult for many European Heads of State or Government to get appointments to meet with him on the fringes of the G20 Summit."
"He had time in Copenhagen to support his home city's Olympic bid, but unfortunately he did not have time to join us in an important European celebration, in other words, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the iron curtain."
"I would be pleased if we succeeded in convincing him that he should not wait until a few days beforehand to decide whether the TEC meeting should take place, but instead that he should support the TEC with complete conviction over the next few years."
"We need trade between Europe and the US to be made easier."
"We need improvements in the area of joint standardisation."
"We need the removal of duties and non-tariff trade barriers."
"We must prevent more protectionist measures from being taken by both sides."
"We must guarantee that products are safe for our consumers."
"We must prevent anti-terrorism measures from obstructing all these activities as is currently under discussion."
"For these reasons, I would be happy if we could make real progress in our cooperation."
"Many of the issues which concern us in other areas of the world, such as wage, social and environmental dumping, are not problems in the transatlantic relationship."
"I believe that we should take the opportunity, on the one hand, to work together with the Americans to solve our common problems and, on the other, to attempt to play a joint role throughout the world in making progress within the WTO or other international organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation."
"I am hoping for good results in this respect next week."
"(FR) Madam President, the election of President Obama has rightly been welcomed as a victory for US democracy."
"However, the recent Nobel Peace Prize that has just been awarded to him places him under pressure."
"Peace in the Middle East?"
"It is something we hope for, but he is certainly not the master card."
"Peace in Afghanistan?"
"There, US strategy has freedom of manoeuvre, but if President Obama listens to his hawks, he risks another Vietnam."
"It is a telling sign that the book by Gordon Goldstein describing the dramatic spiral towards failure in the war in Vietnam has been flying off the shelves in Washington, and there are no copies left in the shops."
"The President must now choose between two strategies: one focuses on stabilisation, the eradication of poverty and the economic development of Afghanistan, by providing a military as well as a civilian presence throughout the country."
"The second aims to concentrate on a few urban areas and from there to launch large-scale operations against Al-Qaida."
"Both options require the despatch of troops, but the first is oriented towards the people, and the second towards the war with, in the background, the risk of a catastrophe."
"Should Europe not save Barack Obama from the old demons haunting the United States, and help him to choose the first of these strategies, focused on the people?"
"That, at least, is the view of my group."
"Madam President, the ECR Group is strongly Atlanticist and seeks ever closer economic, trade and political ties with America, which we consider to be the EU's foremost ally and not competitor."
"We also remain in debt to the USA for its contribution to NATO, which is based on our shared democratic values, and we welcome America's belated commitment to fighting climate change."
"However, we should not pretend to agree on everything."
"I am concerned for instance about the conflicting messages coming out of the US Administration regarding Russia."
"Washington's emphasis on resetting US-Russia relations appears to excuse the Kremlin's blatant interference in its neighbours' affairs, notably in Georgia and in Ukraine."
"The scrapping of the US missile defence shield, due to be deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, was also questionable."
"The recent discovery of a secret nuclear facility in Iran could well confirm this judgment, but we must now all redouble our efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and, as allies of the US, we strongly support their military struggle against Jihadi terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan and their strong efforts to bring lasting peace to the Middle East."
"(PT) Madam President, I would like to begin by pointing out the importance of relations between the United States and the European Union, particularly during a time of global economic crisis."
"There is an increasing need for us to take joint action in tackling the crisis, in the energy market and in the fight against terrorism, but we also need action that is more focused and does not degenerate into more taxation or the kind of absurd attacks currently targeted at a financial system that is necessary for the market."
"Focusing on the financial issue, I would like to highlight the efforts that are being made by both the United States and the European Union towards a policy of better lawmaking, with emphasis on the involvement of stakeholders in the debate on the report."
"Coordinated action between the United States and the European Union is essential if we are to achieve a more mature state of economic relations, and, indeed, one that will lead to a transatlantic market, perhaps by 2015."
"We need to defend Atlanticism here, too."
"It is just as vital to reduce the administrative barriers between the United States and the European Union, so as to create a competitive environment and a market that is more appealing to individual citizens and businesses alike."
"I believe that the transatlantic market can be built on a stable negotiating basis, which will stimulate economies and stop the threat of new economic and social crises like the one we are experiencing at present."
"To conclude, Madam President, I wish it to be quite clear that these are unique conditions, and that a more Atlanticist approach can bring about a better situation."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner referred to the importance of ensuring that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs attends the transatlantic EU-US Summit, and I welcome the emphasis she has placed on the matter."
"Furthermore, as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to draw your attention, first of all, to the importance of signing the treaties on extradition and mutual judicial assistance."
"Significant efforts have been made to strengthen not only political, but also judicial, cooperation, thereby strengthening the ties between Eurojust and analogous institutions in the United States."
"Secondly, I would like to highlight the contribution made to strengthening and initiating, over the next five years, the transatlantic dialogue and, thirdly, I would like to highlight the work performed by this Parliament."
"That is why I would like to ask that information be provided at the next part session of the European Parliament in November concerning the outcome of this summit and, in particular, the chapter on judicial cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters."
"Fourthly, it is clear that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will result in the formidable launch of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, as a new aspect of the European Union's remit, and a new field of European policy on which this Parliament will also decide."
"That is also why, in sensitive matters such as the protection of data and fundamental rights of persons, agreements on Passenger Name Record and SWIFT data should always be consistent with the resolutions adopted by this Parliament in order to guarantee the protection of personal data and, in particular, the resolution adopted on 17 September."
"Finally, with respect to visas, we must remember the importance of reciprocity, as there is currently much room for improvement in that area."
"It is good to cooperate with the United States on visas, but this is an excellent opportunity for us to reinforce the importance of reciprocity in order to ensure that we remain on an equal footing with the United States when signing agreements."
"(FR) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity."
"It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield."
"It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple."
"Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action."
"This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order."
"All these spheres will only make progress if Europe plays its proper political role as a separate global player, in a partnership of equals - to use the Commissioner's expression - and fully assumes its responsibilities."
"From this viewpoint, I must say that there is a certain confusion in the European attitude and sometimes even a certain naivety, and that this also extends to Parliament."
"The approach being taken to the idea of a large transatlantic market, which was Sir Leon Brittan's hare-brained scheme back when he was Commissioner, poses certain risks."
"This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature."
"Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed."
"First of all, however, trade is not really in danger."
"Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests - for example, as in Airbus - or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules - in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken - and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves."
"We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective."
"Madam President, I have a couple of points."
"It is difficult to see how we can fit all of the resolution that we have set out on the TEC into the TEC."
"It is a very small operation, as we know."
"I will be there next Tuesday, Commissioner."
"I look forward to seeing you, along with Mr Brok and other parliamentarians, an issue I will come back to at the end."
"We do, however, have key issues which can be raised in the TEC and can be dealt with as they are sufficiently upstream, to borrow your words, Commissioner. Financial services, for example, which are appropriate to deal with because the outcomes are very closely discussed and are near agreement - not just in G20 but ongoing discussions that we have in Parliament and with the Commission and the Americans."
"In particular, accounting remains one of these aspects within the reach of policymakers and legislators."
"Adoption of high-quality global standards for accounting by 2011 is something which needs to be concluded quickly on the US side."
"On insurance, too, Solvency II has helped to set global regulation - one which needs an answer, frankly, from the US side - and I thank Chairman Kanjorski in the US Congress for the work he has done on the Federal Office of Information."
"Finally, let me just say, on the transatlantic legislators' dialogue, that Congress and Parliament need to step up their game in this area."
"We do not want to follow the Administration and the Commission, as most people in this House would agree."
"We want to be amongst the leaders for change."
"We need to be the impetus for this change."
"TEC needs our support, but the TLD needs to be at the heart of the discussion - not just on the side and not just as advisers, but very much part of the central aspect of this whole transatlantic relationship."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor."
"I think it is very important that we are discussing transatlantic relations, because we find ourselves, in part, in a paradoxical situation."
"The changes which have taken place in the United States have largely been very well received in Europe."
"On the other hand, however, the United States is showing greater interest in other important countries and continents than it did in the past."
"In particular, a revival of contacts between the United States and China has been observed, as have efforts to improve relations with Russia."
"Our problem is that, in my opinion, we want to bring too many matters into the discussion."
"I think we should concentrate on two areas."
"The first area concerns financial and economic matters."
"The second area is security."
"The United States and Europe could do a lot more together in both these areas."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes."
"However, one important point - trade - is only touched on briefly."
"I believe that international trade is a decisive factor."
"The fall in world trade is one of the causes of the economic and financial crisis and I would like to see a greater focus on world trade, even now in the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC)."
"It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area."
"On the contrary, we have only a few trade agreements, there is a risk of bilateralism and there is the possibility that the Doha Development Round will not be continued by the US."
"Therefore, we should address the critical points and I hope that the TEC will introduce some new stimuli to revive international trade."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to look again at one aspect of transatlantic cooperation in the field of policing and justice relating to Swift, which has already been mentioned, that is, the transfer of Swift bank details to the US."
"I believe that we should remember when discussing this point that the Council has given itself a mandate for negotiations with the US on the transfer of data."
"We should remind the Council to keep to this mandate in its negotiations with the US."
"I am very concerned that the European Council will be pressurised to accept the demands of the US and to circumvent European data protection standards."
"I believe that this would send out the wrong signal, particularly because there will be many areas where the level of data protection will be brought into line as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon over the next year in agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, etc."
"I believe that we would be sending out the right signal if the Council and the Commission were to adhere to the data protection standards and uphold them in the face of the US or to insist on a postponement."
"(HU) I read the following in a European Union White Paper in 1996: a fierce global battle is expected in the coming decades between Europe, the United States, Japan and the emerging Asian countries."
"Fortunately, this battle is taking place not with weapons, but mainly in the economic sector."
"Europe must hold its own in this."
"President Giscard d'Estaing, who was Chairman of the Convent, the leader of a government drafting a failed constitution, said that Europe must not be the United States' rival, but a reliable partner."
"This is a key issue in the EU-US Summit's success."
"We must strive for partnership, but if our only consideration is for the United States to regard us as a partner, and we do not get involved in conflicts on behalf of Europe's population, we cannot achieve success in important matters."
"Madam President, I would like to thank all of the honourable Members for their contributions to this debate."
"There is a high level of consensus on the importance of deepening our cooperation with the American administration and the summit that we are about to hold."
"I am very pleased that the American administration is showing such a desire to deepen and develop our relations."
"I think that we have done our homework and we are very well prepared to take some important steps."
"We have a number of problems in common with our partner, the US, and it is therefore appropriate to find common solutions."
"I think that we will be able to make progress with regard to the climate, the economic crisis and the Doha round - and once again confirm how important it is to conclude this - and that we will be able to get extremely important processes off the ground in the legal sphere."
"The economic partnership is a particularly important forum for us."
"We also understand the importance of discussing important regional issues - Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Middle East, for example."
"There were a few specific questions for me."
"As regards the question of visas raised by Mrs Ludford, both the Council and the Commission are doing everything they can to ensure that visa-free travel will apply to all EU Member States."
"It is regrettable that we do not have this in place yet, but we are continuing to work very hard to make it happen."
"With regard to the so-called Tobin tax, I know that there are Members of this House who strongly support this."
"I will say this: a Tobin tax can only work if it is global and if it has global control instruments - otherwise, it will simply be another protectionist measure."
"There is currently no basis whatsoever for an international, global agreement on a Tobin tax and therefore the Presidency will not push this issue."
"I want to be clear on that."
"With regard to SWIFT, we are in agreement with the US on the importance of being able to exchange information on financial transfers."
"This is valuable in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism."
"We now need a new agreement, as the Belgian company SWIFT is moving to Europe, but we are both keen to retain the programme in order to prevent the financing of terrorism."
"As a transitional phase, we need to find an agreement that can apply for a short period until we have the new Treaty of Lisbon in place."
"Experts have looked into this, including the French judge, Jean-Louis Bruguyère, who was asked by the EU to inspect the TFTP."
"Bruguyère found that the legal certainty requirements and the protection of personal data in the current agreement are adequate."
"In the more permanent agreement and once the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, there will eventually be opportunities for the European Parliament to take an active part in shaping this."
"The meeting that we are to have next week is a very important one, but it is nevertheless just a meeting."
"I believe that we can make progress, resolve some issues and get some important processes off the ground relating to those matters that we have in common and need to resolve in a close and strategic partnership with the American administration."
"I am very pleased about the strong support in the European Parliament for the efforts of the Council and the Commission."
"I will, of course, report to you the results next time we meet in the plenary sitting in Brussels."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would first of all agree with James Elles about a greater strategic dialogue with a great strategic partner."
"This is the objective that we have."
"As I said before, it is about cooperating for global recovery, so financial and economic questions will be very high on our agenda."
"We have been one of the driving forces behind the activation of the G20 Summit process which was raised, as you know, to leaders' level last November on the initiative of President Barroso and President Sarkozy, but we are not the only ones that are needed."
"The Pittsburgh G20 Summit has also been a success in providing a platform for flexible macroeconomic coordination as we also seek exit strategies to gradually pare back our respective policies of immediate crisis response."
"The IMF and the World Bank agree that this will require different approaches from each party depending on the respective economic situation."
"Given the current global economic situation, the leaders will naturally also discuss possible ways out of the crisis, of boosting growth and creating jobs, and the question of the regulation of financial markets will be particularly important."
"We think it is necessary to ensure the rapid establishment of a globally coordinated system of 'macro-prudential' supervision based upon close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board."
"On banking, we need to deploy the London and Pittsburgh commitments for better and more capital and stricter prudential rules consistently among financial centres."
"We need to intensify our work towards effective global convergence policies on crisis management and systemically important financial institutions."
"We should also achieve a single set of high-quality global accounting standards on financial instruments by the end of 2010 and, hopefully, complete convergence by June 2011."
"On climate change, we had a very first exchange on climate change with President Obama in Prague."
"I was personally present and we pressured the United States to do more on climate change, but we also know that President Obama has a very important health care issue in Congress and the Senate."
"I therefore think that we will have to put even more pressure on him to redouble the efforts to find committed, binding regulations for Copenhagen, in the light of his preoccupation with the domestic agenda."
"With regard to the TEC, this is a very important new mechanism, or re-energised mechanism, to work on all matters regarding the free market and market barriers."
"We want to eliminate these, which is the ultimate objective of the TEC."
"This was clearly stated in the TEC framework agreement of 30 April 2007."
"Of course, I am aware of the different ideas that have been raised recently - such as reaching a unified transatlantic market by 2015 through the elimination of existing obstacles to economic integration: the so-called Millán Mon report."
"We no doubt need to work on the right balance between ambition and realism, which is why we are working on medium-term priority tasks for the TEC."
"On the question of barriers, we already know that you, Parliament, want to have a study, and we welcome your support for this study."
"It would be important in guiding future work for the TEC."
"The study has not yet been finalised, but is under way, and there are still a number of technical issues to be cleared up before it is totally ready for publication."
"Commissioner Ashton here will deal with this, and I will certainly convey Parliament's interest."
"Let me also say, because this was mentioned, that the Energy Council will not overlap with the TEC."
"The agendas will complement each other."
"It is clear that security issues will go to the Energy Council, whereas regulatory issues go to the TECH."
"The focus of the Energy Council is on new technologies and energy security."
"A very brief word on SWIFT and some GLS questions that have been mentioned."
"The SWIFT agreement is needed as it sets out specific safeguards on data."
"That is clear and the mutual legal assistance agreement would also really like to go there."
"It should also be known that this mutual legal assistance agreement is at the heart of the SWIFT agreement, and any US request is subject to the authorisation of an EU judicial authority within that framework, so we have to keep working on it."
"On the ESTA, we issued a preliminary assessment which concluded that, based on the interim final rule, ESTA is not tantamount to the Schengen visa application process as defined in the European Commission's common consular instructions."
"We will, however, prepare a final assessment once the final rule on ESTA has been published, and this evaluation will also address the question of the ESTA fee if the fee is really put into place."
"You can imagine that we do not want it."
"A last answer on terrorism."
"In our work on the summit, we are discussing with the US how to move towards closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism, especially in the light of the plans to close Guantánamo."
"The need to ensure respect for fundamental rights is essential."
"The conclusion of the mutual legal assistance treaties will also help us in this respect."
"We will therefore also cooperate on how to prevent radicalism, including misuse of the Internet."
"You can see that there is an enormous range of issues."
"We have spoken about all the political issues before, but I agree with the Council President that although this will be an important summit, it will only be one meeting of a few hours."
"Not everything will be solved in one meeting, but it will be a very good restart or re-beginning."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 22 October 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The EU-US Summit in November will strengthen the transatlantic partnership and promote dialogue between the two great powers."
"Relations between them must be based on the values and objectives that we share, and ever closer cooperation is in our common interest and benefit."
"The European Union and United States must adopt a vital role in combating climate change."
"On this point, a number of joint commitments have been made in the fight against the adverse effects of global warming."
"As far as Europe is concerned, one viable, practical solution for protecting the environment is to put the Rhine-Main-Danube navigation canal, which provides a direct link between the ports of Rotterdam and Constanţa, into operation."
"Using inland water navigation as an option will attract numerous economic benefits and also help reduce sound pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"Using this canal and raising its profile will make the transportation of goods cheaper, safer and more efficient in terms of the use of energy resources."
"Environmental protection policies can be supplemented by measures supporting transcontinental mobility and international connections, while also providing safety and security for European goods and citizens."
"in writing. - As the Lisbon Treaty is about to enter into force, the rapid progress in the transatlantic relationship between the two biggest democratic and economic entities will have an increased importance."
"Both the EU and the US continue to be key actors in international trade and providers of stability."
"The European Parliament has been a leading force in advancing transatlantic cooperation, having proposed in its resolutions the creation of a transatlantic free market, as well as establishing new structures for closer political and interparliamentary relations."
"The Transatlantic Economic Council has done good work so far."
"I hope that in the near future, we shall be able to work out solutions to overcome the regulatory barriers between the EU and the US."
"The role of legislators in this relationship will be important."
"Members of the European Parliament are willing and ready to fully contribute to TEC processes."
"We should encourage the US Congress to fully commit itself to a routine Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and thus also to an active participation in the TEC."
"I would like to ask the Commission and the Council how the European Parliament's resolutions have been followed up and, at the same time, to encourage both institutions to vigorously work towards achieving a transatlantic free market area."
"in writing. - Relations between the US and the European Union have always been strong."
"It was with American aid that a shattered Europe was able to reconstruct and develop in the post war years."
"Now the world again faces a crisis and it is more vital than ever that we retain this link and work together to resolve the problems which have beset the world economy."
"The European Union and the United States have a strategic role to play in the recovery process."
"Combined, our gross domestic product represents more than half the world's GDP, and we have the worlds strongest bilateral trade partnership, making up almost 40% of world trade."
"However, further developments must be implemented if we are to combat the economic crisis effectively."
"The Transatlantic Economic Council has created for itself the goal of an integrated Trans-Atlantic market by 2015. This will be done by reducing barriers to trade."
"If this goal is accomplished, economic growth can re-commence and the recovery process can begin."
"The risk of a further 'Credit Crunch' is not over."
"To avoid further economic collapse and unemployment, the EC must ensure coordinated economic policies are put in place in both areas."
"It goes without saying that the economic relationship between the US and the EU must be maintained."
"However, we must not, under any circumstances, allow the US to monopolise Europe in economic terms."
"On the contrary, we must learn from the economic crisis, which had its origins in the unsupervised financial markets in the US."
"Europe must maintain its economic independence and find its own way out of the crisis, particularly as bonuses amounting to billions of dollars are being paid out on the New York stock exchange as we speak."
"Therefore, I am calling for the European position on the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened."
"At the EU-US Summit in Prague in April 2009, President Obama pressed the European Union to offer Turkey full membership in the near future, claiming that the EU would be contributing to better understanding with the Islamic world."
"The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally (so that Turkey would clear the way for Rasmussen to become Secretary General of NATO) should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated."
"Despite American support, Turkey will not become a suitable candidate for accession, because there is no sign of huge cultural, geographical, economic and political differences being reduced."
"The EU should take a clear position with regard to the US on this issue."
"In the light of the economic crisis and the preparations for the climate conference in Copenhagen, it is important for us to take the opportunity of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting to strengthen further the relationship between the EU and the US."
"In the area of the environment, we must discuss new types of foods in particular."
"The opportunities and perspectives of nanotechnologies are also a relevant subject."
"We should definitely hold open discussions on the topics of genetic engineering and animal cloning."
"Europe should not be afraid to explain clearly to its trading partner the concerns of some Member States."
"In the area of chemicals and toxic substances, we must work towards high standards of protection and better coordination."
"This will not only make trade and economic relationships easier, but will also guarantee in particular that consumers in Europe are protected against toxic substances in the environment and in the products they use."
"Constructive discussions will help to ensure that the special relationship between the EU and the US is maintained."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that the resolution on preparation of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting and the EU/USA Summit (2 and 3 November 2009) calls, on page 17, for the United States to treat citizens of the European Union equally and to include all EU Member States in the Visa Waiver Program."
"It is high time that the appeals by Parliament, the efforts of the Commission and the endeavours of the visa-discriminated Member States produced results."
"Otherwise, it will be necessary to take radical action and introduce a visa requirement for American citizens."
"It is time, at last, to bring an end to this one-sided privilege enjoyed by the United States."
"The European Parliament must not tolerate American discrimination of European citizens on the grounds of their nationality."
"The position of Parliament in this matter is all the more significant because not all the governments of the Member States understand the necessity of applying the principle of visa reciprocity."
"One of these is the government of the Republic of Poland."
"The position of the citizens is completely different."
"Over 61% of Poles are in favour of the introduction of entry visas for citizens of the United States."
"In an Internet poll, the number of respondents declaring themselves in favour of such a measure was as high as 96%."
"I trust that the forthcoming EU/USA Summit will be a turning point, at least in terms of visa policy, and that in the new year, in 2010, the citizens of all EU Member States will be able to travel normally."
"In other words, I hope they will enjoy the same freedom as all American citizens who can travel to the EU country of their choice."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0212/2009)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Human rights in Cuba"
"How does the Council assess the current human rights situation in Cuba, in particular with regard to political detainees?"
"Does it have information about the conditions under which the Cuban doctor, Darsi Ferrer, and fellow-prisoner, Alfredo Dominguez, are being held, which are clearly inhumane in the extreme?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I am, of course, ready to move from the US to Cuba and Mr Posselt on a very serious matter, so thank you for your question, Mr Posselt."
"The Council remains seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Cuba, in particular, the lack of progress for civil and political rights."
"The people of Cuba do not enjoy freedom of speech and assembly."
"There is no free press."
"Access to information, including the Internet, remains limited."
"Restrictions on citizens' freedom of movement into and within Cuba have not changed."
"There are currently 208 political prisoners in Cuba."
"This figure has decreased from 2 034 in 2007, but most of the releases were due to completion of sentence."
"Member States' missions in Havana are closely monitoring the list of political prisoners and have a special human rights working group where important cases are discussed."
"Prison conditions, according to human rights defenders and testimonies of political prisoners and their families, are far below the United Nations' standard minimum rules for treatment of prisoners."
"Some prisoners are in very bad health, according to their families, and do not have access to adequate medical care."
"There have been a number of reports of cruel and degrading retreatment, including beatings of prisoners, denial of appropriate health care and psychological pressure."
"Still, however, there are no reports of prison guards or police being prosecuted for abuse."
"The Cuban Government denies the existence of political prisoners and regrettably continues to reject international scrutiny of human rights from independent human rights organisations."
"The Council approach towards Cuba was set out in the common position of 1996, which has since been evaluated by the Council on an annual basis."
"In October 2008, the EU and Cuba agreed on the resumption of a comprehensive political dialogue."
"This dialogue, in accordance with EU policies, not only includes the Cuban authorities but also civil society and the democratic opposition."
"The Council pays special attention to the principles of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms in the 2009 annual evaluation of the common position."
"In the conclusions from June this year, we made clear that these issues will remain one of the EU's key priorities in the relationship with Cuba."
"The Council particularly urged the Cuban Government to release unconditionally all political prisoners, including those who were detained in 2003, and we expressed our concerns for the prisoners and their health condition."
"Furthermore, the Council called upon the Cuban authorities to facilitate immediate access of international humanitarian organisations to Cuban prisons."
"Since the initiation of the political dialogue with Cuba last year, the EU side has brought up the issue of political prisoners at each and every meeting."
"As stated in the last Council conclusions, human rights should always be addressed on these high-level visits and, when appropriate, meetings with the peaceful pro-democracy opposition will be part of these visits."
"The Council decided to pursue the dialogue with Cuba because it provides an opportunity to discuss open issues of mutual interest and concern, including the human rights situation, but we remain seriously concerned about the situation in Cuba and we will continue to follow individual cases, particularly prisoners with serious health conditions."
"Regarding the particular situation of one of the prisoners mentioned by the honourable Member, the European Union has made a manifestation of solidarity initiated by the Swedish Presidency in Havana in August. The manifestation was held to show the family of the arrested Dr Darsi Ferrer that the Union is concerned that national criminal procedural law is not being observed by the Cuban authorities."
"Equally the case of the other prisoner, Mr Alfredo Domínguez, is also being watched by the Presidency and raised in the dialogues with Cuba, and we do have contact with his family."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström for her excellent, detailed answer."
"Mr Brechtmann from the International Commission for Human Rights has given me comprehensive information about the conditions in prisons."
"I would just like to ask whether the Council can attempt to investigate the conditions in which individual prisoners are held and how does it evaluate the developments in Cuba as far as relationships with the European Union are concerned?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - We do not have access to this information formally but, via international organisations, NGOs, contacts, political parties and so on, we do get information - which is a bit fragmented - about the situation of the political prisoners."
"We know that in some cases, their state of health is very serious."
"We try to liaise with families and those NGOs to facilitate the situation but of course, one of the problems is that we have little concrete and confirmed information."
"Another problem is that very many of these prisoners are held in prison without proceedings and without being charged with anything."
"This is contrary to Cuban laws."
"They have the right to know why they are in prison and what they are accused of - a basic human right in all societies, but one that does not exist in Cuba, as we know."
"The Cuban dialogue is, of course, fraught with difficulties, but we think for the moment that it is important to have the dialogue in place in accordance with our decision, because it gives us a chance to try and liaise with the authorities, to be very strict and firm in our criticism, but also to liaise with civil society and the peaceful dissidents."
"We are trying to do this and, for the moment, this is an approach we think could work."
"I do not see any dramatic change to this in the foreseeable future."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, because I believe that, in the field of human rights, as these are the issues being raised by Mr Posselt in his question, we can cooperate better with countries with which we have political and diplomatic relations as well as financial transactions, it is surprising that the European Union and its Member States are maintaining a passive to negative stance towards the logical and permanent request by the Republic of Cuba for the US embargo on them to be lifted."
"My question, therefore, is how does the Presidency view this matter and how do you think the matter should be addressed by the Member States, in light of the fact that, as we all know, Cuba tabled a motion before the UN General Assembly on 28 October for the US embargo to be lifted?"
"Here I am, a peaceful dissident from one of the Member States of the European Union, Hungary."
"I would like to ask for your advice."
"How can we achieve the same level of interest in the human rights situation in Hungary as you have in the human rights situation in Cuba?"
"In Hungary, ever since the autumn of 2006, there has been mass police brutality against peaceful demonstrators, and many political prisoners have been tortured in prison."
"I would like to ask Cuban politicians to please negotiate on our behalf on the basis of all the..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I am sorry but your speaking time is 30 seconds, and the question is about human rights in Cuba."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - The whole European Union has, on several occasions, said that we are against the American embargo and that we think it does not facilitate a future solution on Cuba."
"The European Union has also said that we are willing to enter into a closer cooperation with Cuba, including trade, depending on their progress on human rights."
"For the moment, however, in view of the lack of progress on human rights and respect for democracy and of the number of political prisoners, it is not possible for us to make any progress on this situation."
"It is up to the Cuban authorities to show whether they want this relation with us to show concrete progress."
"Unfortunately, there has been very little progress so far."
"I would be grateful if Members would abide by the rules of Question Time, which involve giving a supplementary question of 30 seconds and keeping to the subject of the stated question."
"Subject: Elder abuse"
"Given that it has already been estimated that more than 10% of older people experience some form of physical, psychological, financial or mental abuse, both in domestic settings and care institutions and that, as a result of our ageing society, this figure is set to rise, what steps will the Swedish Presidency take in order to fulfil its commitment to improve cooperation and efforts at European level in order to increase the quality of care services for the elderly and prevent elder abuse?"
"Mrs Harkin raises an issue that is very relevant today with an increasing proportion of our population getting progressively older."
"Measures in this area fall primarily within national competence and the Community can only support and complement the work done by the Member States."
"However, the Swedish Presidency would like to give this matter some attention and we will do everything we can to increase the quality of care for the elderly and combat the problems relating to the abuse of elderly people."
"In this regard, I would like to remind you of a conference that was held in Stockholm a month ago on the subject of Healthy and Dignified Ageing."
"The conference brought together 160 people from 27 countries."
"There was a high level of participation. The Commission was there, as were the Member States, officials from ministries of health and social affairs and many voluntary organisations."
"The aim was to highlight precisely the problems brought up by the honourable Member: how can we deal with the need for increased cooperation between the health and care sectors to meet the needs of our elderly citizens?"
"It is the intention of the Presidency that the Council should adopt conclusions on this matter on 30 November at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council."
"In the draft conclusions, we are seeking deeper and closer cooperation within the area of healthy and dignified ageing, including through the exchange of information between the Member States."
"The Commission is also urged to draw up an action plan for the dignity, health and quality of life of elderly people."
"I would also like to point out that the Council adopted conclusions in June of this year entitled 'Equal opportunities for women and men: active and dignified ageing' precisely to facilitate the provision of quality care services in connection with home care for elderly people, taking into account the particular needs of older men and women."
"With regard to the issue of the abuse of elderly people in particular, Council Directive 2000/78/EC already prohibits discrimination in the workplace on account of age."
"The Commission proposed that the protection provided by this directive should be extended to a number of other areas such as social security, health care, social benefits, education, access to goods and services, housing and so on."
"This proposal contains many elements that are relevant to the abuse of elderly people."
"It includes care in the home, institutional care and health care services."
"It prohibits harassment, which is a form of discrimination, defined as unwanted conduct with the effect of 'violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment'."
"This proposal is currently being debated in the Council, and the European Parliament has already issued an opinion."
"Unanimity in the Council is required for the proposal to be approved."
"Of course, we cannot pre-empt the result of the debate in the Council, but I would nevertheless like to say that we are doing all we can to introduce legislation that will help to eliminate all forms of abuse and maltreatment of elderly people, which is fully in line with the opinion issued by the European Parliament."
"It is, of course, our firm view that no one should have to suffer harassment or abuse, least of all elderly people, who are so dependent on care."
"Thank you, President-in-Office Malmström, for your considered reply."
"According to the communication from the Commission in 2008, the right conditions have to be put in place in terms of resources, training and support for carers."
"I absolutely agree that this is so, and I also understand that this is a national competence."
"There are, however, some areas where the EU can help. One of them is in the whole area of the cross-border dimension."
"I just wanted to know your opinion on the setting up of a formal structure for exchange of information with regard to health professionals, in this case, care-givers, who cross borders."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I thank the Member for that proposal."
"It is the first time I have heard about this."
"It sounds like a good initiative, but I will have to refer it back to the ministers concerned and feed it into the discussion process."
"Perhaps we could come back to this at a later stage."
"(RO) The European Union has an ageing population."
"Elderly people need special conditions in terms of both medical services and arranging suitable facilities for them in buildings and on public transport."
"Sweden has a long tradition in social policy."
"What proposals are you discussing with other Member States so that living conditions for the elderly can be improved throughout the whole of the European Union?"
"President-in-Office, Ms Harkin has asked a very important question and you have answered it very well but, broadening out the scope of the question, ageism is generally regarded nowadays as 65-plus."
"Would you consider recommending, on a Union-wide basis, increasing, or being more flexible with, the retirement age and having gradual retirement rather than permanent retirement, which seems to happen for most people now?"
"That would help enormously in improving the quality of life and ensuring more respect for the elderly."
"I would say that seems to go a little beyond the title of the question, but I leave it to the Minister whether she wishes to deal with it or not."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - The answer to the first question by the honourable Member is 'yes', particularly because we need to discuss these issues."
"The Trio - the French, Czech and Swedish Presidencies - agreed to reinforce dialogue on issues relating to health and elderly people."
"For instance, there was a conference on Alzheimer's, and the conference I referred to, held a month ago, referred to dignified treatment of elderly people."
"So it was an opportunity to discuss this issue, and the conclusions will be discussed in EPSCO at the end of November, where we will also, of course, consider the report by the European Parliament."
"Concerning the retirement age, this is something that every Member State decides itself, but in the discussions we have on the Lisbon strategy - not the Treaty, for once - on how to increase growth, development and employability and the demographic challenge that we will face, this is, of course, an issue to take into consideration - how to use the competence and experience of elderly people also and to find ways of letting them stay in the workforce."
"It is not up to the Council to decide exactly the age this should happen, but rather to encourage all Member States to make full use of their labour force."
"Subject: Swedish journalist Dawit Isaak imprisoned in Eritrea"
"According to reports in the Swedish media, Swedish citizen Dawit Isaak, imprisoned in Eritrea since 2001, has been transferred to a new prison in Eritrea."
"No one, apparently, has left this prison alive."
"Dawit Isaak has been held in prison under appalling conditions by a rogue regime for almost eight years without being informed why he was so brutally thrown into prison, and separated from his family, friends and work."
"So far, all attempts to have Dawit Isaak freed have been unsuccessful."
"The EU should do more. Isaak is also an EU citizen."
"If nothing is done, there is a risk that Isaak will die without either Sweden or the EU managing to persuade the Eritrean President even to discuss his case seriously."
"What does the Swedish Presidency intend to do to raise the case of Dawit Isaak at the highest EU level?"
"Is it reasonable for Eritrea to receive aid from the EU when that country is so flagrantly violating fundamental human rights?"
"It was eight years ago that the Swedish-Eritrean journalist, Dawit Isaak, was captured and imprisoned in Eritrea."
"He is being held in prison without trial and without charges."
"Neither his family nor the Swedish authorities or international human rights organisations are permitted to visit him."
"Unfortunately, there have been no signs whatsoever of any improvement in the human rights situation in Eritrea over the last few years."
"Responsibility for this situation rests entirely with the Eritrean Government."
"Eritrea's continued breach of its obligations with regard to human rights under national and international law is causing considerable concern in the EU."
"We are particularly concerned about the issue of political prisoners and the lack of freedom of expression."
"The EU has several times demanded the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Eritrea, including, of course, Dawit Isaak."
"On 18 September 2009, the Presidency, acting on behalf of the European Union, issued a very clear statement in which we reiterated our demand for the unconditional release of all political prisoners and stated that Eritrea's actions are in clear breach of the obligations laid down in the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Eritrea has ratified."
"Regrettably, Dawit Isaak's case has not been resolved, but it continues to be a top priority for the EU, the Swedish Presidency and the Swedish Government."
"We will not cease in our efforts until he has been released on humanitarian grounds and can be reunited with his family."
"I can assure you that we will continue to take his case and the situation of his fellow prisoners to the highest level in Asmara."
"Human rights are a key element in relations between the EU and Eritrea."
"We are prepared to help the Eritrean Government to improve the human rights situation."
"In terms of aid, this is governed by and dependent on the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement."
"This agreement deals both with human rights and with the political dialogue to exert pressure to bring about changes."
"It is an ongoing process that is progressing desperately slowly, but we hope that this can be a tool we can use to make progress."
"(SV) I do not need to give you any further details of the terrible case of Dawit Isaak."
"I also know that Mrs Malmström is extremely committed to this matter."
"As far as I know, Dawit Isaak is the only EU citizen imprisoned for exercising his right to free expression."
"Should the EU, then, not get together to issue a special joint statement on Dawit Isaak?"
"Should the question of a special statement not be taken up in the Council?"
"Perhaps Mrs Malmström or someone else should also go to Eritrea and try to meet with Dawit Isaak and also with President Isaias Afewerki."
"I hope this will happen, because I think that it is totally unreasonable for an EU citizen to remain imprisoned without trial year after year, apparently seriously ill and possibly at risk of dying in prison."
"To Mr Schmidt, I would like to say that I really do share your enormous concern and frustration that this situation is continuing year after year and that there is no possibility of getting through to the Eritrean authorities."
"I am certain that both Mr Schmidt and other Members have seen the reports from Eritrea and listened to interviews with its president."
"He is not an easy person to deal with and abuse in Eritrea is widespread."
"We are continuing to work with all the channels we know of, but we do not have access to the prison."
"We have not been able to visit him and we do not know how he is."
"Of course, we will not rule out going there if we believe that it could result in progress on this matter, but for the time being, there is no possibility of obtaining any kind of promise that we would be able to visit him or hold talks about him or to meet his family, who are there in Eritrea."
"It is extremely frustrating."
"We have made a very clear statement."
"As Mr Schmidt said, Dawit Isaak is, as far as I am aware, the only political prisoner of EU origin currently in prison and we are working in various ways to increase the pressure on the Eritrean authorities and to make them understand that Dawit Isaak and his fellow prisoners must be released, if nothing else then in accordance with the conventions that the country itself has ratified, but it is very difficult to have any normal dialogue with this country."
"There are no other supplementaries on that question, so we will move on to the next question."
"Subject: The EU's alcohol strategy"
"It is nearly three years since we adopted the EU's alcohol strategy."
"The intention was that it should be assessed by the summer of 2009."
"Unfortunately, the assessment seems to have been postponed."
"For Sweden, alcohol policy has always been an important issue and one to which it assigns priority in EU cooperation."
"Will the Swedish Presidency therefore seek to ensure that the strategy is assessed without delay? If so, when exactly?"
"Thank you, Mrs Hedh."
"I would like to begin by reminding Mrs Hedh that the Swedish Presidency has put alcohol and health high on the agenda as an important aspect in implementing the EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm."
"Against this background, we have already held three major events."
"The first was the informal meeting of health ministers in Jönköping in July, where the sale and marketing of alcoholic drinks and how they influence the alcohol consumption of young people were given particular attention."
"The second event was an Expert Conference on Alcohol and Health in Stockholm on 21-22 September aimed at supporting a sustainable, long-term and comprehensive strategy within the EU with regard to alcohol."
"More than 450 people participated from, in principle, all of the EU Member States and the participants lent very strong support to the Swedish priorities in the area of alcohol and health."
"The third event was the Global Expert Meeting on Alcohol, Health and Social Development held on 23 September."
"This event was organised by the Swedish Presidency in cooperation with Sida (the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) and the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services and was sponsored by the World Health Organisation."
"The aim was to contribute to a global strategy when the World Health Assembly meets in May next year."
"At this meeting, new findings were presented concerning the link between the harmful use of alcohol, social development and the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, an important link that is worth taking note of."
"Thus, with regard to the question 'will the Swedish Presidency seek to ensure that the strategy is assessed without delay?' the answer is yes; adoption of a strategy within the EU in 2006 was an important step."
"Through its adoption, the Commission recognised alcohol as one of the key factors for determining health within the EU and also the fact that the EU is responsible for tackling risky and harmful alcohol consumption."
"This was reinforced further by support from all of the EU's health ministers in conclusions reached in November 2006."
"Since 1 January 2007, the Commission has been following the trends in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm as well as the changes in policy within the EU."
"Even though we have seen progress in many areas, there has been far too little time to assess the full scale of the impact on health of alcohol policy and drinking habits."
"The first report from the Commission, which was tabled at the expert conference a few weeks ago, was a status report in respect of the EU's alcohol strategy."
"It is an interim report ahead of the final report that is to be tabled in 2012."
"The Presidency will, of course, go through this status report and consider the results of the Expert Conference on Alcohol and Health."
"We will monitor progress."
"We have also funded a number of new studies with a view to ensuring that alcohol remains high on the EU's agenda."
"One of the studies we are funding will examine the effect that the marketing of alcohol has on young people, another will look at the impact of alcohol on elderly people in 10 different EU Member States and yet another will investigate the effect that cross-border trade has on national alcohol policy."
"In our draft conclusions on alcohol and health, which are currently under discussion in the Council's working group, we propose that the Commission should be urged to start to analyse and seek out priorities for the next phase of the work on alcohol and health, to emphasise the fact that we need to look at the period beyond 2012 when the assessment and the current alcohol strategy will be concluded."
"Based on this debate, the Presidency aims to adopt Council conclusions to support an alcohol strategy in December 2009."
"(SV) Mrs Malmström, I know that the Presidency has held several constructive conferences and has spent a lot of time on this matter."
"My question was about the alcohol strategy, in particular, because I have asked the same question before, about six months ago."
"At that time, I was told that the alcohol strategy would be assessed before the summer."
"That is why I raised this question, as the matter has not appeared on the agenda."
"A lot has happened since the Swedish Presidency proposed an alcohol strategy for the EU in 2001."
"The alcohol strategy was adopted in 2006 and a lot has happened since then."
"Some Member States have raised the age restrictions, some have increased taxes on alcohol and some have lowered the blood alcohol concentration limits, for example."
"I am very pleased about this. I would have liked to have seen the Swedish Presidency go a bit further, perhaps, with regard to advertising, but I am nevertheless pleased that a study has now been carried out on advertising, alcohol and young people."
"Thank you for your support on this matter."
"We have indeed tried to highlight this issue, which is, of course, the framework that the EU affords to work within: holding conferences, producing studies, setting out timetables to ensure that everything continues to move forward, as well as securing the involvement of future presidencies."
"I am pleased that we were able to clear up the misunderstanding that clearly arose."
"The intention was for there to be an interim report, which of course is just as important and which we will look at and analyse, but that the final assessment would come in 2012."
"In the meantime, there is a tremendous amount to do and I can also confirm that many Member States are doing a tremendous amount, as everyone in all the Member States has been made aware of the effects that alcohol consumption has on health."
"(LT) Minister, at EU level, the number of road accident fatalities is falling, but the ambitious goals will not be achieved next year."
"The main cause is alcohol."
"In some countries, there is an appallingly high suicide rate, and again alcohol is to blame for this."
"Do you not think that on an EU scale, we should strengthen the already strict measures on alcohol consumption, following Scandinavia's example?"
"In particular, consumption should be restricted for young people."
"Would Sweden like to initiate this?"
"I want to bring the Minister's attention to the fact that in Scotland, the constituency which I represent, a debate on a minimum pricing of alcohol products is currently happening."
"I wanted to take this opportunity to ask the Minister whether there is any discussion in the Council over the issue of minimum pricing of alcohol products."
"There is a big debate happening in Scotland and I was wondering what the Council's perspective is, and whether it is discussing this at all."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - One of the five priority themes in the EC alcohol strategy is precisely the reduction of injuries and death from alcohol-related road accidents."
"This is, as the honourable Member said, a very big problem and it causes enormous suffering and has economic costs as well."
"The Commission has recommended the adoption of a lower maximum limit for inexperienced and professional drivers, while countries who already apply limits should not decrease them."
"There is a recommendation on this, and we are working with the Member States."
"Many States have already applied those recommendations and there are a lot of awareness-raising activities going on to discuss this issue."
"I am not aware of any ongoing discussion on prices."
"There might be."
"I will check with my colleague, the Minister for Health, who is responsible for that, but I do not think that particular issue is being discussed."
"There are many other alcohol-related issues that are being followed up right now, but probably not this one for the moment, because it is, of course, not an EU competence."
"Subject: Environmental aspect of gas pipelines"
"In the European Union, much attention is being paid to the environmental aspects of the new pipelines being constructed to transport gas to the EU (Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream)."
"The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs along the floor of the Baltic Sea, is an exceptional project on account of its size and its potential environmental impact on the Baltic region."
"In the opinion of the Swedish Presidency, what dangers does the construction of gas pipelines pose to the environment, and what measures can be taken to eliminate those dangers?"
"Nord Stream is a unique project for the Baltic Sea area on account of its size and possible consequences."
"The Council is aware of the misgivings that exist with regard to the environmental aspects of the Nord Stream gas pipeline project and has taken careful note of the European Parliament's resolution on the environmental impact of the planned gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea linking Russia and Germany, which was adopted in July last year."
"All of the EU Member States and the European Community are party to the United Nations Espoo Convention of 1991."
"This is the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context."
"This Convention contains a number of relevant obligations that are binding on the parties, with the particular aim of ensuring that an environmental impact assessment is carried out which includes consultation with other parties affected by a particular project."
"The impact of the Nord Stream project on the sensitive Baltic Sea environment is of the utmost importance and must be examined carefully."
"Natura 2000 areas could be affected, as well as areas where there are mines and where chemical ammunition has been dumped."
"The spread of sediment could affect the marine flora and fauna and also have an impact on the fishing industry."
"The fact that the gas pipeline is close to important shipping routes could also entail a risk to the environment and to safety."
"All of the states around the Baltic Sea have worked together now for more than three years within the framework of the Espoo Convention to determine how these obligations relate to how this project is to be executed."
"The Council would nevertheless like to stress that the Nord Stream project is a private undertaking."
"It is therefore the parties responsible for the project who must provide information demonstrating that the project observes the relevant legislation, under the scrutiny of the Member States affected."
"Thus, the Council cannot comment on the Nord Stream project in any way that could be construed as interference in national legal processes."
"(LT) Thank you Minister, for your truly comprehensive answer."
"Evidently, this matter does concern Sweden greatly, all the more so because Sweden is a Baltic Sea country."
"I would just like to underline one thing, that we can never devote too much attention to such matters."
"I would also like you to say that this probably is the case and that during its Presidency, Sweden will continually follow this matter intently and will take appropriate steps."
"I can guarantee, honourable Members, that Sweden is doing that."
"We are very vigilant when it comes to the sensitive environment in the Baltic Sea, which is, of course, at risk from any type of project that is to be carried out, and therefore we have imposed very stringent environmental requirements on precisely this project, and it is now in the process of being examined and scrutinised by various relevant authorities."
"It is not Swedish territory that is affected by this, but Sweden's economic zone, and therefore we have been very careful to point out that it is international conventions, like the Espoo Convention, that form the basis for the positions we are to adopt."
"We must not make any political or economic judgments."
"This is what the Swedish State can look at and that is indeed what we are doing."
"Subject: Elimination of barriers to the free movement of labour between Member States"
"The Swedish Presidency of the Council has recognised that, in the current economic crisis, the key priority is that Member States must be able to respond jointly to challenges and find solutions for overcoming the economic and financial crisis and, above all, reducing unemployment and its adverse social consequences."
"The barriers to the free movement of workers from the Member States which joined the Union on or after 1 May 2004 are limiting the rights of those countries' citizens and could result in clandestine employment and social dumping."
"To remove those barriers means protecting migrant workers on the same basis as nationals."
"Given the Swedish Presidency's commitment to an active policy for the EU labour market and to improving adaptability and mobility, can the Council state what concrete measures it has in mind with a view to eliminating the barriers to the free movement of workers from the Member States which joined the Union on or after 1 May 2004?"
"The Council would like to point out that the free movement of people is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Community legislation and includes the right of EU citizens to live and work in another Member State."
"At its meeting on 9 March 2009, the Council directed an invitation to those Member States that were still applying transitional rules restricting free movement."
"At the time, based on the information available, the Council said that these Member States should consider whether to continue applying these restrictions."
"The Member States were also urged to lift the restrictions during the third phase if no serious disturbances, or risk of serious disturbances, to the labour markets could be identified in the Member States concerned."
"The Council also pointed out to the Member States that priority must be given to citizens from Member States over labour from outside the EU, and that the protection of citizens from new Member States who were already resident and employed in a Member State will remain during the transitional periods."
"The rights of family members have also been taken into account in accordance with the practice in connection with previous accessions."
"The Council emphasised the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the rules on the free movement of workers."
"The Member States have declared that they will endeavour to grant increased access to the labour market to citizens from the new Member States concerned in accordance with national legislation, with a view to speeding up the approximation of their legislation in line with Community legislation."
"In November 2008, the Commission put forward a communication on the impact of free movement of workers in the context of EU enlargement."
"The Commission points out that workers from Bulgaria, Romania and the EU-10 Member States helped to meet a higher demand for labour in the receiving countries and thus made a significant contribution to sustained economic growth."
"Evidence at hand suggests that post-enlargement intra-EU mobility has not led - and is unlikely to lead - to serious labour market disturbances."
"The Commission also notes that the volume and direction of mobility flows within the EU are driven by general labour supply and demand rather than by rules restricting labour market access."
"The Commission concludes that restrictions applied by the Member States may delay labour market adjustments and even exacerbate the incidence of undeclared work."
"The free movement of labour is an important priority for the European Union."
"The movement of labour helps to create more jobs, so that the economy can be adjusted even during an economic crisis."
"The movement of workers also helps to reduce social marginalisation and poverty."
"With regard to the transitional period for free movement that the honourable Member asked about, the Member States have the right to retain their restrictions up to the end of the third phase of the transitional period."
"However, the Council believes that the economic crisis that Europe is currently experiencing should not be used as grounds for continuing to apply the transitional rules."
"Even during periods when demand for labour is low, it can be difficult for employers to fill vacancies with applicants from their own country."
"The Council regularly reviews the question of transitional arrangements."
"The most recent review was at its meeting in June 2009, when the Council took note of the Commission's information on the impact of free movement in the context of EU enlargement."
"The Commission informed the Council that three of the EU-15 Member States had, prior to 1 May 2009, notified the Commission of serious labour market disruptions or the risk of such disruptions."
"Germany and Austria continued to apply restrictions on labour market access by retaining the requirement for a work permit, while the United Kingdom applies a system of ex post registration, which allows workers to start work but requires them to register within 30 days."
"In the information it provided to the Council, the Commission also stated that it would ensure that the provisions of the Accession Treaty are complied with and it reserved the right to request clarification from those Member States continuing to apply restrictions."
"(RO) I would like to ask you whether, as part of the Swedish Presidency's agenda, you have in your timetable any action aimed at trying to continue to persuade Member States which maintain these barriers to the free movement of labour to lift them."
"My second question is whether you wish to include such a proposal on lifting the barriers to free movement of labour as part of the Swedish Presidency's conclusions."
"I would like to thank the honourable Member."
"All of the present Trio, the French, Czech and Swedish Presidencies, confirmed in their conclusions that enlargement has brought great advantages to the EU, it has led to economic growth and there is nothing to indicate that serious economic disturbances have occurred."
"We have mechanisms in place for the regular review of the transitional rules together with the Commission."
"Between these reviews, we can, of course, call on the Member States to take the measures necessary to eliminate discriminatory legislation and ensure that the skilled labour force within the whole of the EU is utilised, but the purely legal aspects are dealt with together with the Commission."
"As I said previously, we carried out such a review earlier this year."
"(DE) Madam President, the fellow Member who asked the question naturally focused in her remarks on the situation in those Member States where parts of the population are emigrating to look for work elsewhere."
"I can understand this."
"However, in contrast, Austria, like Germany, is a country with massive immigration and it could obtain an extension of the transitional period until the labour market is fully opened."
"The reasons for this are clear."
"Negative displacement and distribution effects resulting from major differences in income, in particular, against the background of the current problems on the labour market, and increased immigration could have resulted in the labour market being significantly overburdened, leading to social tensions that everyone wants to avoid."
"Therefore, my question is: will these problems which are affecting Austria and Germany be recognised and are appropriate solutions being planned?"
"All EU Member States have, of course, been badly affected by the economic crises and unemployment."
"The figures look slightly different, but all of them have been hit hard."
"A country is entitled to put in place the transitional rules, which Austria, for example, has done, and the opportunity exists to apply to extend these rules under special procedures if justification is provided to the Commission."
"I am not sufficiently informed about the precise situation in Austria. I do not know if the problems are greater there than anywhere else."
"As I said, all Member States have huge problems in connection with the labour market."
"The Commission states in its report that there is nothing to indicate that free movement has led to disturbances in any Member State."
"In my country, Sweden, which is also experiencing very high unemployment, we have not seen any link at all between free movement and unemployment."
"The people who have come from other EU Member States have been welcome and have been absorbed into the labour market."
"Subject: Harassment by Turkey of aircraft operated by the European Union agency for external border security (Frontex)"
"Since May 2009, six incidents have been recorded in which aircraft operated by the European Union agency for external border security (Frontex) have been subjected to harassment, either by Turkish aircraft or through radio communications."
"The most recent incident occurred on 8 September 2009 when a Frontex helicopter flown by two Latvian pilots was en route from the island of Kos to Samos."
"While flying over the island of Farmakonisi, the helicopter received radio interference from Turkish radar at Datça, demanding that it withdraw from the area and submit a flight plan."
"Is the Council aware of this incident?"
"What are its comments?"
"What measures will it take against Turkey?"
"Yes, the Council is aware of the incidents that the Member refers to."
"The Presidency would like to say that, as a candidate country, Turkey has to share the European Union's values and goals in accordance with the treaties."
"A clear commitment to good neighbourly relations and peaceful solutions to conflicts is a crucial and important requirement for EU membership."
"In accordance with the framework for the negotiations and relevant Council conclusions, the EU has urged Turkey to avoid any kind of threats, sources of conflict or measures that could harm good relations and the possibility of resolving disputes in a peaceful manner."
"I would like to assure the honourable Member that the issue of good neighbourly relations is brought up by the EU on a systematic basis, most recently at the Association Council meeting on 19 May and at the meeting between the EU troika and Turkey's political leaders in Stockholm in July this year."
"As regards the particular point about aircraft operated by Frontex, I would like to mention that Frontex is coordinating several joint operations and pilot projects. These are an important contribution to the protection of the Union's sea, land and external air borders."
"One of the operations is Poseidon 2009, for which Greece is the host."
"It is aimed at preventing impermissible border crossings by persons coming from or transiting Turkey and countries in North Africa and trying to reach the Greek coast."
"The honourable Member is, of course, aware of this."
"Poseidon also includes the stationing of technical facilities in European airspace along the borders of the Greek islands."
"Turkey has, of course, been informed of the operation."
"With regard to operational cooperation between Frontex and the competent Turkish authorities, negotiations are currently being conducted concerning working methods."
"That is very positive."
"An agreement would cover information exchange and opportunities for the Turkish authorities to take part in Frontex joint operations."
"This sort of work could be an important part of the work to prevent illegal immigration and could help to improve neighbourly relations."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, I should like to reiterate once again my appreciation of your honest efforts to answer our questions, but may I say that, from what you have said, you are obviously aware of this incident."
"We are cooperating with Turkey, but you have not given me a clear reply, which is why I wish to focus on and repeat my question as to whether Turkish airspace was, in fact, violated during the Frontex mission, as it claims."
"The reason I say this is that, under this procedure, we are investigating if Turkey is contesting Greek sovereign rights."
"Additionally, may I remind you that, during a recent visit to Greece, the Deputy Executive Director of Frontex, Mr Fernandez, claimed that no such violations were taking place and referred to the pilots' reports on the matter."
"So to come back to my question: did the Frontex mission commit the violations alleged by Turkey or not and what are you doing about this?"
"It is very difficult for the Swedish Presidency to determine exactly when a violation takes place and when not."
"We have been informed on several occasions of the concern that many of my Greek colleagues feel."
"We have discussed this and we have also called for, and held, talks about this with the Turkish authorities and our Turkish counterparts and urged them to work to improve neighbourly relations."
"It is very difficult for a presidency to determine exactly whether a violation is taking place or not."
"This is, of course, based on international conventions and is a bilateral issue between the two Member States."
"Mrs Morvai, you indicated you wanted the floor again."
"If it is for a supplementary on this issue, for 30 seconds you have the floor."
"Madam President, you are probably reading my thoughts because I did not indicate that I wanted the floor, but I wanted to apologise for taking an extra 20 seconds from this extremely lively, huge democratic debate for such an irrelevant question as mass police brutality and political prisoners in a Member State."
"I do apologise."
"If you have a question, you should submit it in the normal way in writing and then it may, if it is appropriate, be answered."
"There are many Members who want questions answered tonight and out of respect for them, we would like to conduct this in an orderly manner."
"(Question 8 fell as the questioner was absent)"
"Subject: Revision of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005"
"Can the Council outline the views of the Presidency with regard to the review of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport?"
"Is the Presidency sensitive to all aspects of the potential impact of the revision?"
"Thank you for your question."
"The Council naturally shares the Member's concern regarding animal welfare."
"The Presidency responded to a similar question from Mrs Harkin in September and stated then that one of the aims of the Swedish Presidency is to encourage the debate on animal welfare, and this is listed as one of the priorities of our Presidency."
"At the meeting on 7 September this year, the Council received news from the Commission that a draft proposal for a review of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport will be tabled as soon as possible."
"At the same meeting, the Council obtained the views of the delegations on the need for new instruments to improve the control and inspection of the international transport of live animals, for example, satellite navigation systems."
"An appropriate satellite navigation system could facilitate supervision by the Member States' authorities, as it is currently very difficult to prove a lack of compliance using the instruments we have today."
"Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 is a more forceful piece of legislation on the protection of animals during commercial transport, as it ascertains the parties concerned and assigns them areas of responsibility and it introduces tighter measures in the form of permits and inspections, as well as more stringent rules for transport."
"Certain aspects of animal transport are not covered by the provisions, namely the maximum number of journeys and spatial requirements for animals."
"In accordance with Article 32 of the Regulation, these aspects are to be included in a report that is to be presented within four years and may be accompanied by a new proposal."
"The Presidency can confirm that we intend to start examining the Commission's proposal on the review of the regulation as soon as the Commission submits it."
"This has not happened yet, but as soon as it arrives, the examination will begin, as we share the Member's interest in the review of this regulation."
"Thank you for your comprehensive answer."
"I share the concerns about animal welfare, but I want realistic regulation that also allows trade in animals which is legitimate and properly policed and I would suggest that we do not need additional regulation."
"We need absolutely proper implementation of existing regulations and I think your comments about navigation, etc. are helpful in this debate."
"Please let science dictate."
"I would ask you to concentrate, perhaps, on horse transport."
"That is a particular problem, and there the regulations are not being implemented."
"Perhaps you would have a comment on that."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I am not an expert in the horse sector of animal transport but I listened to your proposal and I will take it with me."
"I agree with you that normally, it is quite often the case that it is the implementation that is lacking, and there is not always necessarily a need for new regulation."
"Once the Commission proposal comes, we will look at it, evaluate it and see if there is a need for additional measures or, as you imply, only a need to reinforce implementation."
"So we will come back to that as soon as we have the proposal from the Commission."
"Following on from my colleague Mrs McGuinness's question: Ireland being an island nation is very dependent on transport of animals overseas and the restrictions that are being implemented and being proposed to be implemented are regarded by many people in the industry as cost-prohibitive."
"So would you take that into consideration when you are doing the review?"
"Otherwise, if we do not have live transport, you will have a cosy cartel amongst the factories, which will pull down prices further and drive more and more people out of farming."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I realise the difficulties regarding Ireland's situation, because it is an island and because of its dependence as regards transport."
"I think in all legislation it is important, in particular, that we have a great concern."
"We know that there is pressure from our citizens to look at the well-being of the animals but, of course, doing this in an appropriate way and evaluating what has been done."
"Are the provisions sufficient?"
"Are they needed?"
"Is there additional need?"
"Do we need implementation?"
"We must take all that into consideration before we move on to further regulation."
"I am sure that, during the discussion that we will have with Member States, all Member States will have the opportunity to set out their specific situation as input into the discussion."
"Subject: A Commission portfolio for sport"
"Given, on the one hand, the growing child obesity rates in the EU 27, and on the other hand, the importance of life-long health as the EU population ages, the inclusion of sport as an EU competence under Lisbon is to be welcomed."
"To reflect the Treaty's strengthened recognition of the importance of sport, would the Council be supportive of any initiative to include sport explicitly in the portfolio of one of the incoming Commissioners?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Sport activity is subject to the application of EU law today and, as the honourable Member rightly points out, when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, it will provide the EU with a legal basis allowing it to contribute to the promotion of European sporting issues while taking into account the specific nature of sport, its structures, based on voluntary activities, and its social and educational function."
"However, the Council cannot take a view on the internal organisation of the next Commission which, in line with the Treaty, is a matter for the President of the Commission."
"I agree that sport and health go hand in hand."
"Sport activities also promote social cohesion, democracy and personal development."
"Sport is certainly also entertainment, both when the local football club is playing and when there are international competitions."
"It is my belief that a free and independent sports movement also has a responsibility in societal matters such as public health and safeguarding democratic values."
"The Swedish Presidency regards sports policy first and foremost as a national issue."
"One also has to be cautious with new suggestions and programmes which expand policies at EU level in a way which could damage already well-functioning systems such as the ones civic society has built up over the years."
"Thank you very much firstly for taking my question: I appreciate it very much."
"Thank you also for your answer, which was comprehensive."
"I think you have outlined very clearly the value of sport, especially the health value of it, and I am quite sure that, when the Lisbon Treaty comes into being, we can walk hand in hand to ensure that sport, as a competence of the European Union, can get its fair share of promotion and publicity."
"Thank you for taking the question, because Mr Kelly is very shy and he has not said that he was a former President of the Gaelic Athletic Association, the most important sporting movement in Ireland, and that is why his interest is in sport."
"He has been very coy about that, but I thought you should know."
"Thank you very much for that point of information."
"That concludes Question Time."

"Problem of limited access of developing countries to some vaccines (debate)"
"The first item is the oral question to the Commission from Mr Goerens, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Democrats and Liberals for Europe, on the problem of limited access of developing countries to some vaccines - B7-0214/2009)"
"Mr President, within the context of this question to the Commission, I would like to help explore the routes likely to put an end to an injustice that consists in denying 80% of the world's population access to the A (H1N1) flu vaccine in particular, and to vaccines in general."
"The problem is not new."
"In fact, the question comes up every year in connection with the flu season."
"Generally speaking, new seasonal flu viruses first appear in developing countries."
"From then on, laboratories in the industrialised countries start producing a new vaccine."
"They can only begin production if they have previously obtained strains from the country - generally a developing country - where the new type of flu first emerged."
"Once developed, the vaccine is only just enough to protect the populations of the industrialised countries."
"The result is that the populations of the South are unprotected against pandemics."
"I am addressing the Commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice."
"Is it morally defensible to have the level of health protection available to a population depend on the financial resources its country has?"
"I would therefore like to know whether the Commission can tell us what resources it is able to mobilise to fill this gap."
"What, if need be, would be the Commission's strategy, and what partnerships would it establish with the states concerned and with the institutions of the United Nations' system, or with the private sector, in the effort to enable citizens in developing countries to have access to the vaccine?"
"Does the WHO's system of protecting intellectual property, which I did not mention in my written version, constitute an obstacle to the production of vaccines by developing countries?"
"If so, would the European Union be prepared to initiate a debate within the WHO aimed at removing that obstacle?"
"I would like to add one final question."
"Can the Commission outline the measures to be taken to improve the standard of health infrastructure in developing countries, an essential precondition for fairer access to vaccines?"
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) I would like to thank the distinguished MEP Charles Goerens for his question, which gives me the opportunity to deal with both the aspects relating directly to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and wider aspects concerning the European Commission's contribution to improving health infrastructures in developing countries."
"The Community has taken action against the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic both internally and externally."
"In fact, we are dealing with a crisis requiring a global approach, both for reasons of effectiveness in terms of protecting our citizens and from considerations linked to solidarity with less developed countries."
"We talk about effectiveness in terms of the rapid alert systems, the close monitoring of the development of the pandemic and actual virus itself, as well as the assessment of the effectiveness of the preventive and curative measures adopted in the countries where the pandemic first occurred, which are all vital elements in preparing and adapting our own responses."
"However, we also talk about solidarity because the Europe Union, as a main financer of public development aid and a key partner of a large number of developing countries, must support these countries in facing these new threats."
"In our response to these threats, the Commission and the European Union as a whole are not starting their efforts from scratch."
"Based on the precedent of bird flu, resulting from the H5N1 virus, the EU has been able to introduce, along with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and others, effective procedures for exchanging information and coordinating technical assistance, as well as financial instruments such as a trust fund at the World Bank."
"As Mrs Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organisation, says, the world has never been so well prepared for a pandemic."
"The Commission has already played and continues to play a particularly important role in these systems whose components have now been extended to cover every type of flu threat."
"As regards the developing countries' generalised access to vaccines, the new flu pandemic has revived the debate which has been going on for well over two years within the WHO and the working party making the preparations for the flu pandemic, set up at the request of the World Health Assembly, following the decision made by Indonesia, referred to by Mr Goerens."
"This week in Geneva, the WHO is presenting its first recommendations from the group in which the Community has played an active role."
"In accordance with the World Assembly's resolution, the final recommendations must be presented to the WHO's Executive Council, which will meet at the end of January."
"At that juncture, the best possible balance must be identified between, on the one hand, boosting the research into and rapid development of new medical products largely derived from private sector research, for which intellectual property rights nowadays provide a key form of incentive, and, on the other hand, fairness in terms of providing access to the products developed from this research."
"The European Community has reservations regarding any restriction on the exchange of biological material required to carry out the relevant research activities."
"Active international collaboration on a transparent basis and coordinated by legitimate institutions, such as the WHO and its network, is crucial to the rapid development and distribution of solutions for responding to the pandemic."
"In the specific case of influenza A (H1N1), for which there were no vaccine stocks available, there has also been the issue of production capacity and who has first option on this capacity when huge orders are placed by the countries which have the necessary resources."
"The commitment made by some vaccine manufacturers and, more recently, by some countries to earmark 10% of their production or orders for donations or sale at a reduced price to developing countries is an encouraging sign of global solidarity."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, the provision of assistance to third countries in tackling the pandemic is vital and must not just be limited to access to vaccines when they are available."
"It is of paramount importance to continue the support provided by the Commission and Member States in various forms, aimed at consolidating health infrastructures, along with assistance for projects, sectoral or general budget support for partner countries, and even support for international organisations."
"Respect for the principle of allowing countries to assume responsibility for their own development and the commitments to provide effective aid will need to be guaranteed by ensuring, in particular, that attention will continue to be focused on priority diseases and interventions."
"The response to a pandemic is actually based, first and foremost, on having health infrastructures that are better equipped and treat cases early in order to have available, in a fair manner, preventive resources when they are available."
"In the event of a severe crisis, the European Commission will be able to mobilise its humanitarian and emergency intervention resources and will also be able to demonstrate flexibility in its use of the resources already allocated to partner countries which have requested assistance."
"During such severe crises, non-governmental organisations and, in fact, major institutional networks will definitely have an important role to play."
"The Commission therefore knows that it can count on these agencies also effectively swinging into action."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the inevitable arrival and recurrence of a flu pandemic has thrust the issue of vaccination to the forefront of the news agenda."
"However, this has been a long-standing and persistent problem for the developing world."
"The oral question this morning raises an excellent point about the hypocrisy and inequity of the Western world demanding materials for vaccines from developing countries to protect their rich citizens, and then having the audacity to sell the selfsame vaccines back to the poor."
"Above and beyond the need for the developing world to have similar access to flu vaccinations, we must strive to set up a system whereby the poorest people of the world, who are almost invariably more exposed to disease, have the opportunity which we in the West take for granted to protect themselves from preventable diseases."
"Tuberculosis is a good example of the contrast between us and our neighbours in the developing world."
"In Europe, children are routinely given the BCG vaccination, which has greater than 80% effectiveness."
"This has led to a situation in Europe where TB is not the persistent threat is once was."
"Contrast this with the developing world, where 26% of avoidable deaths are caused by tuberculosis."
"The effect of TB in these countries is exacerbated by the fact that it is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads easily within confined spaces such as the squalid shanty towns so prevalent in many developing nations."
"Add to this the fact that 50% of AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS is rife will develop TB, and we can see how lucky we are to be in the relatively controlled immunised area, having programmes such as we do."
"For a shining success story of the power of immunisation and the need for development aid in general, look no further than the example of measles in Africa, where, largely due to vaccination programmes, deaths from the disease fell from 90% between 2000 and 2006."
"Mr President, it is clear that vaccination works and it is clear that we have a responsibility to the people who are suffering from the absence of vaccinations."
"I urge that we in this House keep the pressure on to ensure that this facility is made available to the poorest of the poor."
"May I make a point of order before I sit down: please do something about the lifts in this House."
"I was going up and down in the lift when the doors jammed and I could hardly get here in time for the debate."
"Everybody complains about it."
"Something has to be done."
"(ES) Mr Mitchell, with respect to the issue of lifts, which you have raised, I would like to reveal something which may be a secret part of the Bureau's debates."
"At the most recent Bureau meeting, I criticised the situation you have just described and which, shamefully, is not merely a problem in Strasbourg."
"In Brussels, too, there have been weeks during which it really was impossible to move around the various labyrinthine Parliament buildings, because the lifts were out of order."
"The Bureau shall pass this matter on to the relevant services, so that the lift service can be improved, by one means or another."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I would like to bring the House away from lifts and back to vaccines which prevent deaths."
"I think that is exactly what we should be focusing on."
"Of course I support the call that we have heard relating to the A (H1N1) virus but I want to look much wider: in fact, Commissioner, there are systems that work, and vaccines do work."
"Look at pneumococcal disease."
"It is a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, and is relatively unknown despite its deadly status as the leading vaccine-preventable killer of children under five worldwide."
"Pneumococcal bacteria are the leading cause of pneumonia, which takes the lives of two million children every year."
"This is a global health challenge with solutions."
"It might interest you to know that the Commission and many Member States have already made pledges to support immunisation in the world's poorest countries by supporting GAVI, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, and the pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment (AMC), something you did not mention."
"But we can and we must do more to prioritise pneumococcal disease within existing health and development efforts and to work with developing countries to do the same."
"The pneumococcal AMC offers an unprecedented opportunity for countries to protect their children from this preventable killer."
"Yet the sad fact is that, of the 71 countries that are eligible, fewer than 20 have applied for AMC funding that will save so many lives."
"I would remind the House that expanded access to essential vaccines is a key lever to achieving Millennium Development Goal 4: a two-thirds reduction in child mortality by 2015."
"We must make sure that we put these vaccines in the hands of countries that need them most."
"It is a simple step that will quite simply save millions of children's lives."
"There is before this House a written declaration on this matter, including the pooling of patents."
"I urge Members to sign this and do something that matters."
"Mr President, as we know, this is the week in which most of our Member States are launching the first wave of influenza A vaccinations whilst, at the same time, we are forced to recognise the meagre progress made in this area in terms of access to the vaccine by developing countries."
"This has just been said: millions of people, and primarily children, die each year in these countries from a whole host of diseases, as was mentioned in particular by my fellow Member, Mr Mitchell, earlier."
"I am not saying that the solution is simple, especially - not only, but especially - because the question of access to the vaccine is in no way comparable to that of access to medicines, for at least two specific reasons: the small number of producers and control of the refrigeration chain, which is still difficult."
"There are positive elements, however: the fact that, for the time being, the virus is not mutating and the announced availability of three billion doses each year."
"These are obvious facts and they demand, they encourage the launching of a strategy on a worldwide scale."
"In the limited time granted to me, I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that I therefore think that the European Union must wholeheartedly support the call by the WHO for a fair distribution of vaccines, first and foremost, in the areas of high mortality, and that we must also create the conditions for, and encourage the development of, private and public partnerships so as to effectively combat the shortage of vaccines in the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to stress the importance of the question that was asked by Mr Goerens, which is a matter of basic justice."
"We are all perfectly aware that, in an influenza A pandemic situation, it would be southern countries that bear the brunt of this problem and the consequences of the spread of the virus, and not northern countries."
"Every year, we sit idly by as thousands of citizens die as a result of pandemics that have already been eradicated or are treatable in northern countries, and there is a very long list: malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, tuberculosis."
"The list is endless, yet we watch and do nothing about this problem."
"In fact, we use the southern countries as suppliers of samples of new strains of viruses, free of charge, so we can improve treatment in northern countries, but we do not provide an effective response to these problems."
"I would therefore just like to add some more questions to those that were asked."
"Do we actually want to treat this problem as a public health problem or as a business?"
"If we want to treat it as a public health problem, then we have to ensure equal access to treatment in all regions of the world and we therefore have to be more effective in our efforts."
"That being said, I would like to ask, and I hope that it is not the case, if we are waiting for there finally to be surplus stocks of vaccines in Europe or for the side effects to prove too harmful before we show our generosity and suddenly start sending the necessary vaccines to southern countries."
"Lastly, I would just like to ask if the European Union, if we Europeans, and if the Commission feels comfortable with a system or with a model whereby northern countries deal with pandemics by means of a prevention model and southern countries are given palliatives or simply leftovers."
"It is now Mr Guerrero Salom's turn to take the floor, and I would like to say that I am very pleased, and somewhat moved, to be able to give the floor, for the first time, to someone who has been a great friend and colleague for many years."
"(ES) Thank you for your kind words, Mr President."
"It is an honour to work for the institution of which you are currently the Vice President."
"I have taken the floor to support the interest raised by this issue, namely providing support to developing countries to prevent and combat the H1N1 influenza pandemic."
"However, beyond the matter of the pandemic, I would also like to point out that diseases currently have more of an impact on developing countries than on developed ones."
"Many diseases, which have been eradicated in developing countries, still claim the lives of tens of millions of people in the developing world."
"These countries have to protect the health of their inhabitants, the health of their citizens, but they lack the means to do so."
"In order to fight against AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases, these countries need vaccines to which they currently do not have access and which they cannot buy."
"I would like to encourage the Commission, in the way that the Commissioner has described, to seek to make alliances, promote programmes, motivate donor countries and work towards ensuring that developing countries have access to generic drugs at prices which their citizens can afford."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) In addition to what I said at the start of my speech, I would also like to emphasise the following points."
"The European Commission permanently provides financial assistance for health-related matters to numerous developing countries as part of projects, programmes and budget aid."
"In order to comply with national priorities, the Commission will examine, along with its partners, the way in which it can use these resources to reinforce the methods used to combat the pandemic."
"What I have already said implicitly I am going to repeat explicitly: the European Commission does not have the technical and financial instruments to purchase the vaccines itself."
"However, by cooperating closely with the World Health Organisation and forming alliances and signing agreements with different stakeholders, we will work together in preparing the responses to the requests made on this subject."
"That concludes this item."
"Financial and economic situation in Moldova (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the economic and financial situation in Moldova."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) The elections that were re-run on 29 July in the Republic of Moldova were a crucial test of the country's ability to consolidate its democratic development and continue to progress towards rapprochement with the European Union."
"We are pleased that the elections were held in a calm, orderly atmosphere and that the new government has not only expressed its firm intention to favour a pro-European course, but has also adopted a number of measures pointing in this direction."
"On the other hand, the new authorities in the Republic of Moldova are facing enormous difficulties."
"One of the most serious crises and biggest difficulties is the need to tackle the consequences of the economic and financial crisis."
"Among the European Union's neighbours to the east, the Republic of Moldova is probably in the most precarious economic situation."
"Trade and industrial production have collapsed not only as a result of the crisis, but also due to the political unrest triggered by the parliamentary elections in April."
"The amounts of money transferred from abroad by Moldovan citizens, which accounted, up until last year, for over a third of the country's GDP, have dropped far below the usual level."
"Exports and imports have fallen dramatically."
"The same applies to domestic demand and industrial production."
"A sharp drop is forecast for 2009, by even more than 10% of GDP."
"Given that the Republic of Moldova is already the poorest country in Europe, this decline will hit particularly hard and will exacerbate even further the difficulties the population is struggling with, especially the most vulnerable people in society."
"In order to provide aid to the Republic of Moldova and its population, the European Union is prepared to support this country by offering it macrofinancial assistance, on top of whatever may be provided by the International Monetary Fund, and as part of a coordinated effort with the latter."
"In addition, we will provide specialist assistance and speed up payment of our usual aid to this country."
"With regard to macrofinancial assistance, as is necessary for this type of assistance, our support will depend on concluding an agreement on a support programme between the Republic of Moldova and the International Monetary Fund."
"Representatives of the IMF are currently in Chişinău, and we await their report with interest."
"We cannot go ahead with preparing a macrofinancial assistance programme before launching the programme with the IMF."
"Therefore, it is too early for us to be able to know what form the macrofinancial assistance programme which the European Commission might provide will take"
"We expect the country's authorities to ask for help, not only to consolidate their currency reserves, but also to cover their budget deficit."
"I must also mention that the Republic of Moldova is eligible for both grants and loans."
"The final composition of this assistance package will depend, of course, on the needs which will be identified."
"In the meantime, the European Commission has already sent a mission of experts to Chişinău, headed up by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG ECFIN, to provide the authorities in the Republic of Moldova with help in drawing up their economic programme."
"The mission's objective deriving from the recent meeting with the authorities in Chişinău was to help them evaluate the country's response to the current economic situation."
"The Commission's services have been used on this occasion to gather the information required to prepare a macrofinancial assistance programme."
"The Commission remains available to continually offer the authorities in Chişinău specialist consultancy in this area."
"At the same time, we are endeavouring to speed up the payments from the budget support operations featuring as part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"In September, the European Commission approved an increase from EUR 30.5 million to EUR 34.5 million of the ceiling for payments earmarked for budget support this year."
"Of course, the aim of our assistance in the form of budget support is, first and foremost, to encourage reforms in the agreed sectors, and not only to plug gaps in the budget."
"However, in the current situation, it is more than a means of supplementing the limited budget resources."
"It is also a way of helping the population of the Republic of Moldova to overcome the real difficulties they are facing."
"We welcome, in particular, that Members of the European Parliament have requested urgent support for the Republic of Moldova."
"In the coming months, we will call on you to support the efforts we are making in this area."
"We are confident that Parliament will promptly approve the macrofinancial assistance package for the Republic of Moldova when it is tabled before it."
"This will enable us to ensure that this assistance is provided in good time."
"Before I conclude my speech, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to refer briefly to the situation in Transnistria."
"I would first of all like to stress how important it is for us not to lose sight of this problem against the backdrop of the significant political changes which are taking place in the Republic of Moldova."
"The talks aimed at resolving the conflict should be resumed as soon as possible in the 5+2 format."
"We are optimistic about this as the new government has reaffirmed its support for this principle in its programme."
"The European Union has an increasingly important influence in this process."
"We are counting on the new government in Chişinău to adopt a proactive approach to this problem, which will help resolve the conflict."
"As far as we are concerned, we have just launched two project packages, with financing from the European Commission, for strengthening confidence in the health, environmental protection, social and economic sectors."
"This action is part of our constant wider efforts aimed at resolving the conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Moldova is at a crossroads, both politically and economically."
"We are fully committed to supporting the country's future development."
"We will continue to do our utmost, at this particularly critical juncture, to ensure that our support is substantial and effective and that it is delivered at the right moment."
"The Republic of Moldova is going through a serious economic, financial and institutional crisis caused by the global economic and financial climate, and especially by eight years of Communist government."
"The early elections held in July 2009 and the victory of the Alliance for European Integration mark an important step towards fulfilling the European aspirations of Moldova's citizens."
"The victory was achieved through the effort of the parties in the Alliance against Communist methods and against both the influence of the situation in Transnistria and the influence of the Russian Federation."
"We must admire those who achieved this victory almost single-handedly by successfully gaining the trust of Moldova's citizens."
"Moldova needs help."
"The stability of the new government in Chişinău depends on this, as does the future development of this former Soviet state towards the west or east."
"I strongly believe that Moldova will receive assistance from a number of quarters."
"This must include us."
"The European Union has no option other than to respond positively to the efforts of the Alliance for European Integration in Moldova."
"This specifically means negotiating as soon as possible an association agreement between the European Union and Moldova, initiating very quickly a constructive dialogue aimed at introducing a visa waiver for Moldovan citizens and providing the Republic of Moldova with financial support so that it can cover the budget deficit."
"The European Commission must provide Moldova as soon as possible with the macrofinancial assistance it so desperately needs."
"Commissioner, I listened closely to what you were saying and I am pleased that the Commission is paying attention to the Republic of Moldova and that you are preparing a macrofinancial assistance package, except that it all depends as well on collaboration with the IMF."
"What I would ask is for you, the Commission and the IMF not to deal with Moldova in parallel, but to collaborate with each other so that we do not end up with the scenario where the IMF is expecting the Commission to act and vice versa."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (BG) It gave me particular pleasure listening to Mr Orban talk about the European Commission's intentions for and its approach to Moldova."
"I believe that we need to give Moldova very clear signals from the European institutions and the European Union as a whole, and provide the necessary support, both financial and economic."
"However, I must stress that political support is also required for the current government and its attempts to extricate Moldova from the difficult situation the country is in."
"After two successive elections, this government will obviously endeavour to address the population's real problems, something which appeared to have been given a back seat during these last months, if not for years."
"In addition to this, we must bear in mind that at the moment, the political situation in Moldova, even if it seems more stable and positive, can very quickly shift in a different direction."
"I believe that it is still completely unclear as to whether Moldova will manage to elect its president and if this does not happen, the country will obviously go ahead with new elections next year."
"This would be the worst possible development, not only for the country itself, but also for the people of Moldova."
"This is why we support the Commission's efforts."
"I believe that our group and Parliament will support the European Commission's intentions."
"In addition to this, we must very clearly warn Moldova, its government, and the current opposition that it is time for Moldova to face up to the population's real problems, and that there must be no political games at its citizens' expense."
"It seems to me that such a strong warning will be understood in Moldova by the opposition as well at the moment."
"We also support the idea of quickly signing an Association Agreement which, as mentioned by Mr Marinescu, should also include a visa waiver, a serious problem that has been causing tension between Moldova and Romania, and this should include the creation of a free trade area too."
"We think that, apart from the urgent measures being proposed by the Commission, we must get the Eastern Partnership, launched in the middle of this year, to start operating properly."
"We must also show real results in line with this European Union policy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (RO) The Republic of Moldova is in an extremely difficult economic situation."
"The financial crisis in the European Union has also affected the countries adjoining us, and it is our duty to help them."
"The economic crisis in Moldova is not only a consequence of the global crisis, but is primarily due to a lack of immediate action that was required when this crisis broke out in the Republic of Moldova."
"In fact, because of the elections, the former Communist administration distorted local budgets by making preferential allocations to authorities controlled by Communists."
"In addition, the decision was also made to keep an artificial exchange rate between the leu and euro, at a level which had to ensure that the population in this country next to us was not affected by the crisis."
"So now, with winter approaching, local authorities are at risk of being unable to pay for thermal energy, and the government will have problems paying salaries and pensions."
"We welcome the initiation of negotiations between the government of the Republic of Moldova and the IMF and World Bank."
"I am confident that they will be concluded with an agreement which will take into account the economic, political and social realities in the Republic of Moldova."
"The Republic of Moldova does not need to have conditions imposed on it that are impossible to fulfil, given the delicate political and economic situation in the country."
"In April, we had a few occasions where we discussed the Republic of Moldova in the European Parliament."
"We all agreed that the European Union must provide financial support."
"This is all the more important now when liberal, pro-European forces are in power."
"This is why, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am clearly asking the Commission to ensure that the proposal it is going to draft includes specific offers of macrofinancial assistance because the Republic of Moldova needs help immediately to be able to cover the budget deficit, which is likely to reach 14% of the country's GDP by the end of 2009."
"In the medium term, the Eastern Partnership may serve as an important instrument, but it must become operational as soon as possible and be allocated sufficient funds."
"We are also asking for a proposal to be included in the future association agreement on creating an expanded, comprehensive, common free trade area, along with a proposal on a visa waiver for Moldovan citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, possibly the political situation in Moldova will relax tomorrow as a result of the election of a president supported by the Coalition for European Integration."
"Otherwise, as we have heard, new early elections will have to be held and, if it comes to that, the EU should provide constructive help."
"This cannot, of course, be limited to observing the elections and I should like here to address the problem of how voter participation can be increased and the result can be made more transparent."
"Around one million Moldovans work and live abroad in the west, especially in Italy, Portugal and Austria."
"Their percentage of participation in the elections was in single figures at the last elections and there are logical reasons for that."
"For example, in Italy, it was only possible to vote in Rome and Bologna and numerous Moldovans scattered around the country did not make use of this opportunity due to the cost involved."
"We, the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and also the Moldovan Government, should ensure that more ballot boxes and special polling stations are set up at the next elections, so that Moldovans living abroad can take part in these elections, because it is from them that we can expect a clear commitment to Europe, which is why I should like to direct your attention, your focus, not only to economic and financial support, but also to the need for us to provide conscious and constructive political support."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, Moldova is Europe's poorest country and is also landlocked, but has recently had a successful democratic election."
"The new parliament must now choose its president wisely."
"However, it would undoubtedly be more prosperous and secure if it did not suffer from an artificial territorial division."
"Very little progress has been made towards a resolution of the frozen conflict in Transnistria - a problem which goes back some 17 years."
"This is largely because Russia bankrolls the illegal regime in Tiraspol and continues to garrison troops in Transnistria."
"We can usually judge Russia's sincerity by its degree of commitment to resolving conflicts like this one, but the fact is that in Transnistria, as well as in Georgia and Ukraine, Russia cannot resist interfering."
"Russia maintains that Moldova, as a former Soviet Republic, is in its sphere of influence."
"Such concepts are outdated."
"Moldova, as a manifestly sovereign and European country, could one day join NATO and even the EU."
"The EU must redouble efforts now to resolve outstanding issues in Moldova and give it the appropriate financial assistance it requires, but this will not happen by naively resetting relations with the Kremlin."
"I would like to talk about both of these problems and also about the following report on Georgia."
"We are given too little time to assess such complex issues."
"I feel obliged to state that Czech President Václav Klaus was not mistaken in his statements either on the situation in Moldova or on the border conflict between Georgia and Russia."
"That is all in the past, of course, while we are facing a new set of problems today, despite the fact that we have a Commission President but no new Commission."
"I would like to applaud the report on the Georgia-Russia conflict at least, and its effort to make an objective assessment of the entire situation."
"We have announced the ambitious Eastern Partnership programme and I would like to make some brief proposals in relation both to Moldova and Georgia."
"Firstly, the Eastern Partnership project must not be regarded as a policy instrument against Russia, but as an instrument for resolving issues jointly with Russia."
"Secondly, the question of the territorial integrity of both Moldova and Georgia must be resolved in accordance with international law, and not through the so-called Thessaloniki-Kosovo variant."
"Thirdly, both countries have expressed interest in closer cooperation with the European Union and this must involve appropriate financial support as well as real political support, for example, by relaxing the visa regime."
"Fourthly, both countries need a lot of help in the area of consultancy, particularly in relation to the running of public institutions such as the offices of the president, the parliament, the public prosecutor and so on. Fifthly, both countries have an urgent need for assistance, particularly over the establishment of a legal framework for freedom of expression and a free media, through which they can give their own citizens a greater feeling of confidence."
"In order for all of this to be fulfilled, the European Union must be ready and able to complete the job of integrating these countries into the new Europe through political and financial support and other mechanisms as well."
"Failing this, the Eastern Partnership will be regarded simply as a piece of geopolitical manoeuvring and it will remain just an empty idea."
"Failing this, we risk simple disillusionment and more words spoken at the end of our election period about the need for new orange, pink or whatever other revolutions."
"We may indeed provide funding for these but they will not amount to a real resolution of the situation or an improvement in the lives of the inhabitants."
"Mr President, the financial and economic situation in Moldova can be summed up in a few words."
"It is a total disaster, as Dr Aneli Gabani, one of Europe's leading experts on Moldova, informed me yesterday."
"A new government team may have taken office in Chişinău on 25 September with a promising name and programme - the Alliance for European Integration - but the Communist Party remains strong and is already preparing its return to power by forcing new elections, as expected."
"If the European Union wishes to support the current Moldovan Government's European course, Brussels must attend to this very quickly."
"Therefore, the Council and the Commission must urge the IMF to come to Moldova's assistance as quickly as possible without immediately demanding social austerity."
"Let us allow the reform-minded cabinet a political breathing space."
"It goes without saying that the European Union itself must also provide generous funding in this case."
"After all, Moldova's political future is on the European agenda here today."
"(RO) I, too, wish to welcome the Commission's intention to support the Republic of Moldova."
"The Republic of Moldova needs support that has to target the country's population."
"This is the only way in which the Republic of Moldova's citizens will be able to acquire the confidence they need to find a path towards stability and growth."
"The macrofinancial assistance package which was agreed on here must obviously be put together as urgently as possible."
"Action must not be delayed because, if there is any delay, we will end up with disappointment in Moldova instead of confidence."
"In addition to this, I believe that the government in Chişinău must be supported politically because, after a long period of time, the country is, at last, genuinely opening up to the European Union."
"The name chosen by the government coalition is certainly no coincidence."
"It is made up of parties who really want a different option to the one that has been chosen by Moldova until now."
"This political support is vital, all the more so as there is a risk, and I strongly emphasise this point, that Moldova will be regarded as a local problem, at the very limit, a problem for the Romanians inside the European Union."
"It is anything but this at all."
"It is a European problem, and I am pleased that there are Members with a whole variety of perspectives speaking on this subject."
"After all, Moldova is close to Europe and must be supported at a time when this opening is present there."
"Otherwise, we risk falling back into a cycle of delays and procrastination, which was typical of the Voronin administration."
"Democratic developments and support from the EU may actually also lead to a resolution of the situation in Transnistria because this region was in stalemate."
"This was because the government in Chişinău was reluctant to end the stalemate and adopted an ambiguous, unconstructive position on this."
"On a final note, Moldova's citizens require visas."
"The situation there is by no means any worse than the situation in the Western Balkans, and citizens from the Republic of Moldova must therefore enjoy freedom of travel."
"(RO) As I also said here on Monday in the European Parliament, Moldova needs concrete actions, not promises."
"Moldova is currently in the most difficult economic situation among all the states on our continent."
"This is precisely why the institutions of the European Union must identify solutions for providing immediate macrofinancial assistance to the Republic of Moldova."
"This aid is intended to cover the budget deficit equivalent to 14% of GDP."
"There has been a need for a very long time to initiate negotiations for a new agreement with Moldova."
"They have now become a possibility and we hope that they will be conducted at the fastest rate possible."
"However, the parliament in Chişinău is in a difficult position."
"The risk of new elections is still present."
"The election of a new president, initially scheduled for tomorrow, had to be postponed for another 10 days."
"I am delighted at the enthusiasm with which the Commission announced the start of these negotiations and I hope this enthusiasm continues."
"We cannot afford to disappoint the Moldovan people."
"They need us, they need Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, in our discussions in this House on Moldova, a lot of attention has been paid to the country's very poor economic situation, but frankly speaking, the situation today is far better than it was a year ago."
"We see Moldova making clear progress towards an economy capable of providing for its citizens' well-being."
"Paradoxically, Moldova is now in a better situation than it was a year ago, while Ukraine, which was held up as an example for all to follow, is in a worse situation."
"We can see progress in what Moldova and its government are doing."
"The European Union must hold out a clear European perspective to this country and give firm support to the present authorities to prevent the old political nightmare from returning."
"Moldova's current situation is the result of eight years of rule by communists, and if we do not want to be instrumental in returning that incompetent team to power, let us help the present Moldovan Government and the Moldovan people."
"Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for all the declarations concerning Moldova and the steps the Commission wants to take in the future."
"Being from Poland, I know how important such steps are and the declarations on strengthening weak democracy in transition in their countries."
"The developments in Moldova are important for its people but are also very important for the entire region."
"This is what I want to stress."
"During the transition process, the reforms are very fragile in many post-Soviet countries and the successes in Moldova will be an important example and an important signal to other pro-reformist groups in the post-Soviet region."
"Talking about the fragility of the government right now and the situation in Moldova, we have to remember experiences at the beginning of the 1990s in this country, when the difficult economic situation led to a failure to pay pensions and salaries and to a break in reforms."
"Right now, we are talking about helping the economic situation but we also have to remember the need to strengthen institutions."
"At the heart of all democracies are the institutions: political institutions, institutions concerning the rule of law, the judiciary system and the freedom of the press."
"Poland has recently done much to help Moldova during the elections and prior to them, but I think we particularly have to use the Eastern Partnership as an appropriate measure because it offers many possibilities."
"I think that not only is the Commission taking important steps but we in Parliament - when we receive all the documents - also need to speed up our process and our decisions to help resolve the situation."
"Madam President, the pro-European Government in the Republic of Moldova cannot be left to become victim of the serious economic situation."
"I call for more substantial assistance than the package already agreed to by the Commission and I insist on this."
"Financial assistance must support the population and must support the reforms which the country has to implement, as encouraged by the Union."
"These reforms need to be backed by enhanced and quick financial support from the Union, coupled with a monitoring mechanism to ensure and support the proper management of its funds."
"Finally, the new agreement with the Republic of Moldova should be an association agreement as in the case of the other countries under the European neighbourhood policy."
"Visa liberalisation should be negotiated and helped to happen."
"(RO) The economic crisis is also being strongly felt in the Republic of Moldova."
"Romania and the Republic of Moldova have particularly close economic relations."
"My country is the number one destination for Moldovan exports and the second biggest source of imports."
"However, these commercial exchanges have been hit hard by the harmful introduction of a visa scheme by the former Communist administration."
"However, these exchanges have been resumed following the removal of this scheme."
"The granting of the EUR 100 million credit promised by the Commission must be speeded up."
"With this in mind, an IMF mission may visit Chişinău in the near future."
"Poland has also promised to provide substantial aid."
"The European Union must take into account that the outcome voted for by the citizens of the Republic of Moldova in July showed that they are opening up to Europe."
"Considerable intervention is required now from the European Union before the onset of winter so as not to allow any chance for the anti-European forces to take advantage of the difficult situation the Republic of Moldova is currently in."
"So far, not a single euro has reached the Republic of Moldova."
"(RO) The will of Moldovan citizens has brought about a radical change in Chişinău with a pro-European government that sincerely wishes to commit to a proper project for the Republic of Moldova, a European project."
"Moldova is currently facing serious economic and social problems, and the European Union must demonstrate that this symbolic word of 'solidarity' does not only apply during election campaigns."
"We must show that we, the European Union, are up to fulfilling the expectations of the citizens in this country."
"Faced with the disastrous situation left by the Voronin regime, the effects of the economic crisis, not to mention the onset of winter, the Republic of Moldova needs help now."
"We must not forget, talking about the IMF, that many European Union Member States are major players in the International Monetary Fund, and the decision must be made now."
"(LT) I was, in fact, an observer during the elections in Moldova, and am familiar with this situation."
"It is a state with a rather complicated historical past - there is Trans-Dniester, Gagauzia, Moldova and many other matters."
"Almost all post-Soviet system states firstly require a certain amount of financial support."
"Therefore, I would really urge you to begin talks as soon as possible and to initiate talks with the International Monetary Fund, as we all really ought to support this state and this government that has been formed since the last elections and which is following the path to democracy."
"I think my colleagues were quite right in what they said on specific steps for the future, that is, on opening the opportunity for a free trade zone, on the visa regime."
"These are everyday matters that we will also have to solve in the future."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to put on record the reasons for my vote."
"I am in favour of the European Union providing support to Moldova to deal with a critical situation."
"I am in favour of financial support provided by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, namely urgent support and financial aid to the people of Moldova."
"I am in favour of providing political support to the coalition government in Chişinău, as this move will open the gates to hope."
"These gates need to be held open with financial aid."
"The people of Moldova must be able to leave their country and travel, which is why I am in favour of a proper visa policy."
"I am also strongly and decisively in favour of the agreement being an association agreement."
"Madam President, EUR 100 million does not seem to be a sufficient sum."
"We desperately need to provide immediate and urgent assistance."
"(RO) The increasingly encouraging messages which the European Union has been sending Chişinău recently are being welcomed there with great enthusiasm."
"This is because the majority of this country's citizens are pinning great hopes on becoming part of Europe."
"These aspirations are easy to understand."
"The European Union has demonstrated on more than one occasion its ability to get its members out of difficult economic situations and that it has the mechanisms required to do this."
"However, there are motives which arouse a certain concern, linked to the danger of the Moldovans' enthusiasm waning."
"The primary reason for this is that the model of the agreement being proposed to Moldova does not offer the same guarantees on integration as the Stabilisation and Association Agreement offered to states in the Western Balkans."
"On the other hand, the negotiations on the agreement will require more time, which was already stated from the start."
"I believe that the European Union also needs to propose quickly an alternative option, such as a huge economic aid plan, perhaps even a mini-Marshall Plan for Moldova."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) I have made one extremely important observation: the political support is there in Parliament for strengthening ties with the Republic of Moldova and bringing this country closer to the European Union."
"I must specifically reply to some of the issues that have been raised just now."
"One of the most important of these related to the coordination between the European Commission and International Monetary Fund on granting macrofinancial assistance."
"As I have said before, we work closely with the IMF on coordinating our assistance procedures."
"It is still too early for us to say how these agreements will turn out, but we think that the European Union may wish to ensure that the adjustment programme also includes a series of reforms that we regard as essential to ensuring good governance and sustainable growth in the future."
"Based on the experience gained from macrofinancial assistance programmes for other countries, it is possible that, as part of the negotiations on the exact procedures involved in providing this aid, certain conditions may crop up specifically linked, for instance, to good governance, which was mentioned by several speakers, and to harmonisation of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"I want to emphasise once again the following fact: based on the rules which we need to follow, we are not able to grant macroeconomic assistance alone."
"Therefore, an agreement needs to be concluded between the authorities in the Republic of Moldova and the International Monetary Fund."
"Without this agreement, the macrofinancial assistance which we have spoken about more specifically cannot be provided."
"On the other hand, I want to assure you that we are coordinating our actions with the International Monetary Fund."
"An IMF delegation is currently in Chişinău."
"As I have already told you, our colleagues from DG FIN are also in Chişinău, coordinating the dialogue with the International Monetary Fund, as well as with the authorities in the Republic of Moldova."
"Another issue that was mentioned concerns what other assistance the European Union can give the Republic of Moldova that is geared towards the population, to show that we actually want to support not only the authorities in the Republic of Moldova, but the population as well."
"Let me give you just a few examples."
"This Community assistance has brought and will continue to bring specific benefits to the population."
"We are cofinancing road infrastructure projects, the modernisation of Chişinău airport, the expansion of the Republican Clinical Hospital in Chişinău, which is the largest in the country, as well as the consolidation of primary medical assistance."
"In spring this year, we supplied medical equipment with a value of EUR 4.5 million to 60 clinics in the Republic of Moldova."
"This country is the largest per capita beneficiary of Community assistance after the Palestinian Territories."
"As part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the assistance budget, which rose to EUR 40 million in 2007, increased this year to EUR 62 million, and is forecast to continue growing."
"We cannot clearly quantify at the moment the size of the financial assistance package as part of the macroeconomic support and the other programmes and types of support we are going to provide."
"A figure for this will be given when we reach the stage of concluding an agreement with the authorities in the Republic of Moldova, one which will specifically meet the needs that this country has."
"There were two further issues raised."
"One of these concerns the timetable for the negotiations for concluding a new association agreement with the Republic of Moldova."
"I wish to tell you that last week, the European Commission sent a delegation to Chişinău for technical consultations with the authorities on negotiating a new agreement."
"The agenda for these talks includes the format, objectives and timetable for the negotiations, as well as the components in the future agreement."
"We are therefore in negotiations on this issue."
"The last matter I would like to mention is about the issue of the visa waiver."
"According to the joint declaration made on 7 May 2009, which marked the launch of the Eastern Partnership, the European Union is going to adopt measures that gradually move towards a visa waiver, with the long-term objective of achieving this for every country which is a member of this partnership."
"The conditions for this are fulfilment of the requirements relating to good governance and security, and guaranteeing security of movement."
"At the present juncture, the European Commission is waiting with particular interest for the Council discussion about initiating a structured dialogue on a visa waiver with the Republic of Moldova."
"Until then, we have been and are still giving strong encouragement to the authorities in the Republic of Moldova to continue their reforms in the areas of justice, freedom and security, which will undoubtedly facilitate the discussions about easing the visa regime."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Commission's report on the economic and financial situation in the Republic of Moldova is completely unequivocal."
"The government in Chişinău is going through difficult times caused not only by the global economic recession, but also by economic decisions which were wrong or put off for too long by the previous government."
"Apart from this, the certainties that we are dealing with at the moment are that the Republic of Moldova has clearly declared itself in favour of the European option and it wants to be much more than a mere state bordering the European Union."
"At present, Moldova is looking for support in getting out of the economic downturn, as well as for allies."
"Moldova is inextricably part of Europe and the support from the Community could take the form of specific measures, apart from giving encouragement and making statements of support and rapprochement."
"We are living in an interconnected, global Europe where no government can work miracles on its own, especially when they are expected overnight by a people forgotten for far too long by their own leaders."
"A hand of cooperation extended by Europe to Moldova and a greater rapprochement between Chişinău and Brussels will instil greater confidence in the investors in this country."
"This will then be reflected in the long term by stability and growth."
"The Republic of Moldova's path towards democracy has been difficult and it has now turned towards Europe."
"However, the new government majority in Chişinău is in a fragile position as it is also getting over the postponement of the vote by its parliament on the appointment of the President of Moldova."
"At the same time, the difficult economic situation facing the new government may have serious social and political repercussions."
"In these circumstances, what is needed is urgent, huge support from the European Union in many areas, including the three strands in the future Association Agreement: the political agreement, the free trade agreement, and the visa waiver."
"Financial support is crucial for ensuring this state's stability and encouraging democratic and economic reforms."
"Indeed, the EU and IMF must allocate considerable macroeconomic aid to cover the budget deficit and social costs for the subsequent period."
"I must express the hope that the presidential election in Moldova and the changes which will occur in the European Commission and EU Presidency will not affect the priority that must be given to European assistance for this state in our immediate vicinity, on whose territory the closest unresolved conflict to the EU's borders is taking place."
"This factor must not be overlooked because it directly affects the stability of Eastern Europe and the security of Europe's borders."
"The Republic of Moldova is a very important partner for the European Union, and the situation within the country reflects on the stability of the entire region."
"The new government would like to join the European Union in the future, which is why we should support it to keep the changes the country is undertaking on the right track."
"In this context, it is very important to use the opportunities afforded by cooperation in the framework of the Eastern Partnership, which would involve signing an association agreement and liberalising visa policy."
"The European Union needs to remember how important it is to support post-Soviet states trying to democratise their political life."
"The announcement made by the Swedish Presidency about initiating as soon as possible negotiations on a new agreement with the Republic of Moldova, intended to replace the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, is more than welcome in view of the new political situation in this state."
"The Republic of Moldova's European destiny has been reinforced by the pro-European majority government formed in the parliament in Chişinău."
"I believe that especially now, at a time when the effects of the economic crisis are being felt deeply, the Republic of Moldova must be supported by the European Union, which also means financially, while identifying mechanisms that will help encourage reforms in the Republic of Moldova which, in turn, will bring this state closer to fulfilling its desire of joining the EU."
"Mechanisms involving economic cooperation and commercial agreements are powerful instruments for making the Republic of Moldova's European destiny become a reality."
"The preferential commercial terms granted by the European Union in early 2006 and Moldova's participation in CEFTA in 2007, along with all the Western Balkan states, some of which are EU candidate states, link the economy of this country to the European single market."
"This is the point where it can await the prospect of its integration into the EU."
"I believe that the European institutions must attach particular importance to not only political relations with the Republic of Moldova, but to economic and commercial relations as well."
"Report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I wish to protest against manipulation by somebody in the secretariat."
"A list was provided for the debate on the fact-finding mission to Georgia, but names of certain speakers, including mine, have been deleted."
"I therefore request my speaking time in accordance with what had been arranged until the last minute."
"I request the floor after Mr Kasoulides."
"Mr Landsbergis, it appears that there are only speakers on behalf of the groups, and you already have a speaker on behalf of the PPE Group."
"However, what I can offer you is to take you under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss Georgia with you."
"Less than one year after the armed conflict with Russia, Georgia is facing numerous challenges which are of direct interest to the European Union, and we must give this country our undivided attention."
"The report from the Independent International Fact-finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, overseen by the Swiss ambassador, Heidi Tagliavini, was compiled at the European Union's request based on the Council's decision."
"However, it is totally independent and the European Union has not been involved at all in the process of drafting it, nor had anything to do with its content."
"Consequently, I will not go into detail on its results."
"We believe that the report has achieved its main aim, which was to provide explanations for the events which took place in August 2008, as well as for the main causes of the conflict."
"The report clearly highlights, as often happens in conflict situations, that no single party is to blame for the conflict."
"Both Georgia and Russia are criticised for their actions."
"Another lesson identified in the report is the need for quicker and more decisive action by the international community in extremely tense situations which may degenerate into violence."
"The European Union firmly maintains the commitments it has assumed with regard to Georgia's territorial integrity."
"At the moment, we should focus our efforts on avoiding future conflicts and resolving ongoing tensions peacefully, as this is the only way to long-term prosperity and stability in the region."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the war has left a profound impression on Georgians and the country is still facing fundamental problems, such as meeting the basic needs of thousands of displaced persons."
"As a result, I am pleased to say that the implementation of the package of post-conflict assistance prepared by the European Commission with support from Member States and other parties is working well."
"As you are aware, the European Commission's package provides assistance of up to EUR 500 million for the 2008-2010 period."
"Some of the areas which the package focuses on include the needs of displaced persons inside the country and on economic measures aimed at generating economic growth and stimulating job creation."
"In addition, the European Commission has proposed that Georgia should benefit from macrofinancial assistance amounting to EUR 46 million to help this country overcome the impact of the financial and economic crisis."
"At present, the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia is still the only international presence monitoring the situation in the country."
"This mission plays an essential role, but we would still like to see its activities extended across the whole territory."
"The talks in Geneva, co-chaired by the European Union, OSCE and the UN, offer a unique opportunity for political dialogue with all the partners."
"We will continue to undertake every effort to promote constructive discussions which will lead to concrete results."
"At the moment, the working party for displaced persons inside the country and humanitarian aspects, co-chaired by the European Commission and UNHCR, is discussing a set of measures intended to be accepted for returning refugees and displaced persons within the country and other displaced persons."
"At the same time, in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two mechanisms for preventing and responding to incidents are yielding some positive results in terms of reducing the number of incidents and facilitating the crossing of the borders by these persons."
"Taking into account the events of the recent past, it is important to reinforce stability, security and prosperity in Georgia."
"The need for economic and political reforms in this country is greater than ever."
"The Eastern Partnership, launched in Prague in May, is an important framework for strengthening the support we give Georgia, both bilaterally and through multilateral cooperation with other partners in the region."
"One key element is the proposal to establish stronger political and commercial relations."
"According to the Eastern Partnership, the External Relations Council agreed in September that the directives on negotiating new agreements must be prepared for all three countries in the Southern Caucasus, including Georgia."
"Apart from strengthening our political relations, we will propose that the new agreement with Georgia should include the creation of an expanded, comprehensive free trade area."
"It is important to mention that such an area would ensure the gradual alignment of Georgia's economy with the EU internal market."
"It goes without saying that this ambitious long-term objective will still require Georgia to make and support efforts aimed at implementing reforms."
"Negotiations on an expanded, comprehensive free trade area will only start after the necessary conditions have been fulfilled."
"Allow me to add that, as far as relations with Georgia are concerned, our action to step up contacts between people is making progress."
"The Commission has concluded the negotiations on an agreement to facilitate a visa waiver and ensure readmission, the text for which is available in the Council."
"We hope that the procedures can be finalised as soon as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we all agree that Georgia is a key player in our neighbourhood."
"Consequently, it is of paramount importance for us to keep our commitments in this country in order to help it resolve the numerous challenges it is facing, particularly with regard to pursuing its reform programme."
"As Georgia makes real progress in implementing political and economic reforms, the EU's relations with Georgia will become deeper and closer."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, first of all, we take note of the report just given to us on the independent fact-finding mission."
"It is very difficult in circumstances like these to say who started things and who followed."
"What is important is that the facts remain on the ground a year after this conflict, and that they violate a number of principles which the European Union has to support."
"First, as you said Mr Commissioner, there is the principle of support for the territorial integrity of Georgia."
"All our diplomatic and other actions should never encourage UDIs or separatisms."
"Faits accomplis created by the use of force are not acceptable and can never be acceptable."
"Secondly, there is the right of displaced persons to return to their homes and properties: the basic freedom of movement, as you said, to cross the dividing lines."
"Ownership of property and settlement should be at the centre of our policies and initiatives need to be undertaken to address these humanitarian and human rights issues independently of the outcome of any political settlement."
"Thirdly, the hostilities in South Ossetia have proven that there is no such thing as a frozen conflict."
"The term frozen has a notion of appeasement."
"A lack of interest on the part of the international community may lead to chronicity and an unsettled conflict is a potential threat to peace and stability."
"One year after the conflict, I underline once more the successful role of the European Union and the French Presidency in achieving a speedy ceasefire and the mission which monitors it."
"The presence of European monitors is a guarantee that no side can claim from now on arbitrarily that the other has started hostilities."
"Efforts now should be diverted towards a political settlement, however difficult this is, and the political negotiations launched in Geneva immediately after the hostilities should be encouraged to continue."
"We support the efforts for a new association agreement, under the framework of the Eastern Partnership, which goes beyond opportunities for trade and investment."
"We also support an agreement to facilitate the procedures for issuing short-stay visas and on readmission between the European Community and Georgia, and we are satisfied with the post-conflict assistance package, which is operating well."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission, we welcome the impartial and independent investigation of, and the subsequent report on, the 2008 conflict in Georgia, conducted by the International Fact-Finding Mission headed by the Swiss diplomat, Heidi Tagliavini."
"Before the outbreak of hostilities in South Ossetia on the night of 7 to 8 August 2008, which claimed many civilian lives, we had been witnesses to months of provocation from all sides."
"The Russian military intervention, including its invasion of Georgia, was disproportionate and unjustified."
"Both sides to the conflict were guilty of breaches of international humanitarian law, which has also been confirmed by the report and by various organisations, such as Human Rights Watch."
"What are we to do now?"
"Russia must fully honour the peace accord."
"First of all, it must withdraw from the areas it has occupied since 7 August 2008."
"It should provide immediate, free and unlimited access to South Ossetia to members of the EU Monitoring Mission and international agencies, including the UN, so that they are able to supervise the ceasefire and deliver humanitarian aid."
"Approximately 25 - 30 000 Georgians remain displaced in South Ossetia and the de facto authorities of South Ossetia must facilitate their return to their homes."
"Georgia's territorial integrity must remain beyond question."
"There are, however, worrying signs of authoritarianism in Georgia."
"The abuse of the legal system by President Saakashvili, the mounting hostility towards any opposing views, the steadily diminishing freedom of speech and the sometimes confrontational nationalist rhetoric are all to Georgia's detriment."
"Georgia will only be able to return to the pro-European and democratic path and become attractive to other countries in the region if it upholds the ideals it embraced during the Rose Revolution."
"All actors should avail themselves bona fide of the opportunities presented by the Geneva negotiations."
"The situation in the Caucasus must be given serious attention at the next EU-Russia Summit."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have the opportunity to convey my approval to the rapporteur."
"The report has an extremely important role even if it only refutes the widespread myth - a myth spread by the Russian Federation - that Georgia started the war."
"At the same time, this report is balanced, and criticises both sides in the conflict, even saying that they could not prevent the conflict."
"The report is certainly significant because it very clearly states the fact that the Russian Federation - right from the start of the conflict - organised training on South Ossetian territory, and provided the South Ossetians with military technology and also other military equipment."
"Another essential moment in this report is definitely the question of 'passportisation', which the Russian Federation has been implementing for many years, both in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia, and thus creating a conflict with international law, not to speak of the undermining of good neighbourly relations."
"Though the report says very clearly that this passportisation has not made the people living in South Ossetia or Abkhazia into citizens of the Russian Federation, only de jure are they still Georgian citizens and also because of this, the Russian Federation's claim that they were protecting or sending people to protect their citizens in South Ossetia definitely does not hold water."
"Another important part of the report is certainly the fact that it speaks of the ethnic cleansing on South Ossetian territory in the Georgian villages."
"This is a very important moment."
"Unfortunately, however, the report does not deal with the ethnic cleansing which the Russian Federation carried out in Abkhazia from 1991 when, because of Georgia's independence, almost a quarter of a million Georgians were forced to leave Abkhazia, their own country."
"Also, finally, Madam President, I would like to say that the most important thing of all is, of course, the reference in the report to the fact that Georgia's independence, autonomy, sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected."
"For us, the question today is can this really be done, and if we now, before long, are celebrating 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, then I would like to ask, ladies and gentlemen, when will we be able to celebrate the day when Abkhazia and South Ossetia are united with Georgia?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would like to join the previous speakers in warmly congratulating Mrs Tagliavini and her team for the report they were able to deliver."
"The report made it very clear that both sides were responsible for the escalation to the conflict that finally took place in August 2008."
"It is clear that Russia had been building up a military presence in South Ossetia, which was Georgian territory."
"However, it is also clear that those provocations led to an overreaction by Georgia's President Saakashvili."
"It is important to have said that both sides were responsible, and we now have to look at how things can develop in the future."
"That was the very big achievement of this report."
"I also agree very much with everybody who has said that the territorial integrity of Georgia, and of all countries, has to be respected."
"International law has to be respected."
"However, it is also important to look into some of the reasons: the aggressive language, xenophobic language and nationalistic language that were part of the build-up to this conflict."
"Another thing is to ask what the EU will do now."
"We have a monitoring mission, which is important, but it has to have access to all parts of Georgia in order to support displaced persons and others."
"In our discussions now - the member of the Commission has suggested moving to a free trade zone with Georgia, and Parliament will be discussing microfinancial assistance for Georgia - it is clear that the EU also has to consider placing conditions on Georgia, for example, to reduce the amount of its military budget."
"The defence budget has been building up over recent years in Georgia, which is then short in other areas, such as social issues, civil society and media freedom."
"The EU has to monitor that very closely."
"In brief, it is important that the EU supports efforts to tone down the aggressive language, and financial assistance has to come with conditions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the ECR Group and on behalf of the delegation of the European Parliament for cooperation with the Parliament of Georgia, of which I am the chair, I welcome the report which the Commission has submitted."
"The report is credible and has not been questioned by any of the parties to the conflict."
"We are monitoring the situation in Georgia closely and we are also monitoring details of the preparations for Georgia's membership in NATO."
"We fully back the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia as an independent state."
"We cannot accept the idea that Georgia or any other country lies within the exclusive sphere of influence of the Russian Federation or of any other country."
"In connection with the military conflict which took place in Georgia a year ago, we are monitoring with great unease the situation in South Ossetia in particular."
"We are uneasy about the situation regarding adherence to ceasefire agreements and we are particularly uneasy about the situation of the refugees who were forced to leave their homes and who are unable to return."
"The EU's humanitarian assistance is unfortunately not getting through to Abkhazia and South Ossetia at the moment."
"Both ethnic Georgians and other inhabitants are suffering in these areas at present."
"It is also a matter of great regret to us that the independent peace observers sent to Georgia by the EU have not even been able to work in these areas."
"The report states that both sides in the conflict violated international law."
"It is not our role to judge, but nonetheless it is clear from the report that the steps taken by the Russian Federation go far beyond the general concept of necessary defence."
"We are extremely concerned by the information on the ethnic cleansing and violence against civilian populations which took place both during and after the conflict, according to the report."
"In the future work of the inter-parliamentary committee, we will be supporting an immediate end to all violence, an immediate lifting of blockades preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to those who really need it, access for international peace observers and the greatest possible alleviation of the impact of the conflict on innocent civilians."
"We will support all steps that lead to an ending of the conflict and to a restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia."
"Madam President, 'there are no winners,' says the worthwhile report by the commission of investigation on the armed conflict in Georgia in the summer of 2008."
"I do not share this conclusion."
"Of course there was, and is, a winner: Russia."
"With the help of the Georgian President, the Kremlin is completing, resolutely and by military means, the political annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"The loser is the Georgian State although, incidentally, it can console itself with the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continues to assert that Abkhazians and South Ossetians are Georgian citizens."
"I should like to emphasise this commendable stance on the part of the Moscow Patriarchate, which I am sure is an example for wavering Member States to follow."
"The Tagliavini commission rightly criticises the mass provision of Russian passports to Georgian citizens in Abkhazia and South Ossetia as being contrary to international law."
"This erosion of Georgian sovereignty is currently being mirrored exactly by the erosion of Ukrainian national sovereignty in the Crimea, where Russia is handing out new passports liberally to Ukrainian citizens."
"Therefore, an important political lesson that the European Union should draw from the Tagliavini report is that it should actively assist Kiev in the defence of its national independence against any of its neighbours."
"European projects in the Crimea are an excellent opportunity to do so, and the same is true in Georgia."
"(DE) Madam President, the conflict in the Caucasus in 2008, also called the 5-day war, was a regrettable armed military conflict on Georgian territory between Georgia and Russia, which also affected the so-called 'renegade provinces' of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Due to what was unfortunately often one-sided reporting by the international media on the facts and background to the war, I should like to clarify a number of points: the US sharply condemned Russia's military action, describing it a demonstration of pure intimidation and power and defended Georgia's stance."
"The first thing that needs to said here is that Russia was not the aggressor and reacted to the war started by Saakashvili."
"He knew full well when he implemented his reunification programme that he was facing an all-powerful adversary, but he was counting on NATO and the US to cover his back, which is why he decided to wrest renegade provinces back by force."
"Russia's reaction was doubtless excessive, but was taken in accordance with international law in a so-called self-defence situation."
"Thus, US support for Georgia was obviously not only aimed to protect the democratic right of self-determination, but also - it must be said - had military and political objectives, especially as Georgia was functioning as a strategic vassal state in the Caucasus on the Russian border."
"The Georgians should be cautious in allowing the US to cover their back."
"You only have to think of Hungary in 1956, when the US again offered their support, as we know."
"In any event, the outcome was devastating: the Hungarians were abandoned by the western world in their fight for freedom."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the report of 30 September 2009, in which the investigation committee set up by the EU Council of Ministers argued in detail that the justification under international law cited by the Georgians for the attack is invalid."
"Madam President, Ms Heidi Tagliavini, head of the mission, wrote the following comments in a separate press summary: 'It must be said that the conflict of 2008 was predictable and preventable';"
"Who would prefer to uphold increasing uncertainty and armed violence with an openly approaching tragic outcome?"
"Ms Tagliavini noted three legal personalities as defining the indifferent international community: the United Nations, the OSCE and the European Union."
"Now we, the European Parliament, are among the three great hypocrites who saw, knew and did not want to prevent the recent bloody stage of that 17-year war."
"Other main conclusions of the mission remain of global importance as well."
"They are: no more peacekeepers from a neighbouring country as they usually defend particular zones d'état but not peace."
"The impact of a great power's coercive politics and diplomacy against a small and unsubordinated neighbour should be considered, not to mention eventual loss of important parts of territory through creeping annexation."
"There are no winners in this conflict."
"When the international community is among the big losers, the political culture of cooperation has suffered."
"Two more quotations: 'Established principles of international law such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states were ignored'; 'falling back from civilised standards of political interaction in Europe is a consequence'."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SL) Madam President, Commissioner, I had the opportunity of visiting Tbilisi myself in September last year."
"The question of Georgia's territorial integrity and stability has a strong bearing on the stability of the region at large, which unfortunately has a stable history of instability."
"There is no one truth, there are several truths and they often contradict each other."
"When decision-making politicians lose hold of their senses, the consequences are unpredictable and wide-ranging."
"Direct and collateral damage is huge, but the consequences will affect innocent people first and foremost."
"Neither interference by the major powers nor support for this or that side can lead to success."
"We need action that will restore and strengthen confidence, which is currently non-existent."
"The Caucasus is a complex region and, like the Balkans, has more history than it is able to digest and cope with."
"Quick fixes and xenophobia will never be a path to success."
"However, while disrespect for the rights and legitimate freedoms of minorities is the main cause of conflict, the causes are wider than that and include those of an economic nature, primarily energy and geopolitics."
"However, geopolitics demands that the major powers act responsibly, because grass always grows sparsely where the elephants roll."
"We have to teach those elephants the lesson that not all the grass is, or will ever be, theirs."
"(PL) Madam President, I believe that the present debate has fallen into the pattern of focusing mainly on curing the symptoms resulting from the grave situation in Georgia."
"Georgia is currently a country where the European Union's reputation as a major force on the international scene is being decided."
"The truth of the matter is that nobody has honoured Mr Sarkozy's plan, and it has already been consigned to the historical archives; that Russia is persisting in its military integration of Abkhazia and Ossetia; and that the European Union will not be able to build its status as a power whose word commands respect as far as the situation in Georgia is concerned."
"The best evidence of this is that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is absent from today's debate, and only Mr Orban is putting forward the Commission's position."
"Mrs Wallis evidently does not believe the matter is sufficiently important, judging by the strict limits she has imposed on the speaking time allowed for this question."
"(HU) This is an issue that concerns the major powers, although it is a human rights situation."
"As pawns in the major powers' games, civilians, minorities and democracy are always the victims in this situation."
"Where there is separation and division, security is replaced by uncertainty and guns do the talking instead of having negotiations."
"What can be done?"
"The European Union must show some credibility."
"The EU must adopt a minorities policy which guarantees minorities the right to use their mother tongue, promote their culture and enjoy autonomy in France, Romania, Greece and Slovakia as well."
"The key to the situation in Russia, Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia lies in the EU."
"The EU must come up with a solution and be able to set an example for these countries."
"Madam President, although it is factually correct that President Saakashvili did indeed launch an attack on South Ossetia in 2008, this was only after provocation including severe economic sanctions and a build-up of Russian troops in the occupied territories."
"The report does not seem in my view to fully reflect the fact of the disproportionate response by Russian forces, which involved bombing civilian areas of Georgia like Gori, and allowed systematic ethnic cleansing of Georgians from South Ossetia and the occupation of Georgian territory by Abkhazian forces."
"Saakashvili, in my view, was indeed intemperate in seeking to regain control of sovereign Georgian territory, and made a terrible political mistake - though it was, after all, Georgian sovereign territory."
"However, Russia now is determined illegally to establish a sphere of influence in other countries in its neighbourhood, the so-called 'near abroad', which are, of course, sovereign territories which should be respected in international law."
"Madam President, there is one conclusion to draw from the conflict, which is that the international community has, for far too long and too readily, agreed to the existence of so-called frozen conflicts which, as my colleague, Mr Kasoulides, has put it, equals appeasement."
"The central fact of this conflict is that Georgia did not invade Russian territory, whereas Russia invaded Georgian territory with massive military force and was about to occupy its capital."
"It was an unprecedented breach of international law and undermines the credibility of Russia as a reliable partner."
"As international reaction to this invasion has remained ambiguous, Russia can feel itself a winner, which means that there is a likelihood of similar aggressions, for example, in the Crimea or even in the Baltic Sea area."
"Therefore, we need a clear commitment from the EU to be present in Georgia and to guarantee its free choice and territorial integrity."
"It will be of utmost importance to have a presence there."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) I would like to be very brief and start by saying that, as very many speakers have mentioned, the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity is crucial to the actions we carry out."
"It is a fundamental issue which we bear in mind in every measure we take."
"I want to make it very clear by saying that the Commission will still continue in many different areas to support cooperation and ties with Georgia, enabling this country to advance and move closer to the European Union."
"This support and these efforts will be implemented, as has been said, in many areas."
"We will continue to be present at the negotiations in Geneva where there is a political dialogue in which all the parties are involved."
"This is essential to resolving this situation."
"We will also continue to provide assistance to displaced persons."
"We are in the process, as well, of initiating negotiations on the association agreement, including a free trade agreement, which obviously includes issues related to easing the visa regime."
"I would finally like to say that in preparing for these negotiations, we certainly want the authorities in Georgia to fulfil certain conditions and certain obligations deriving from the rule of law and from respect for human rights and for fundamental rights, definitely along with other economic conditions, and which are linked to trade exchanges."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.55 and resumed at 11.05)"
"(PT) Mr President, pursuant to Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, on personal statements, I would like to say that I feel that my name is used abusively in amendments to the budget regarding coercive abortion, which were tabled by Mr Deva and Mr Szymański."
"The amendment to which they refer, and which I submitted in an opinion on the report 'A special place for children in EU external action', said the following, and I quote:"
"'Calls on the EU to firmly pursue the elimination of all forms of discrimination against girls (since conception) and commit adequate resources to overcome the subsequent asymmetries'."
"(PT) My text seeks to protect girls from discrimination before birth, namely against selective abortion based on sex, but does not aim to prevent all activity linked to termination of pregnancy."
"My text is different, in its wording and in its aims, from that of Mr Deva and Mr Szymański in the amendments to this budget."
"It is therefore not right to draw a parallel between them and, still less, to mention my name in this regard, which I feel is a reprehensible attempt at political manipulation."
"I shall vote against Amendments 727, 732 and 734, tabled by Mr Deva and Mr Szymański."
"Sakharov Prize 2009 (announcement of the winner)"
"I would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009."
"This morning's Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2009 to Memorial, the organisation of Oleg Orlov, Sergey Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva and all other defenders of human rights in Russia whom it represents."
"We have awarded this year's prize to Memorial."
"We sincerely hope that by doing so, we will contribute to ending the circle of fear, uncertainty and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation."
"We also hope to advance our message that civil society activists everywhere must be free to exercise their most basic rights of freedom of thought and freedom of speech and freedom of the written word."
"We need to be free to follow our thoughts because this is essential in getting at the truth."
"Let me share with you my great satisfaction in being able to announce this prize as the President of the European Parliament and, in particular, as a man who comes from Solidarity."
"At one time, we had serious problems very similar to those that our colleagues and partners in the Russian Federation have today."
"I am very pleased that truth and freedom will always win in the end."
"This is how it was in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The fact that the Russians who are seeking the truth today are unable to go about their business freely is a major problem for the whole of Europe as well as a personal tragedy for themselves."
"The purpose of this prize is for us Members of the European Parliament to express our great support for their activities."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to make a couple of general points: since 1988, which is over 20 years ago now, the European Parliament inaugurated the annual Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought to honour persons or organisations for their contribution to the development of human rights and fundamental values."
"We should also remember today all those extraordinary people who, through their own efforts and dedication, opposed the harsh realities of oppression, persecution and exile."
"They are often 'ordinary' people who show exceptional courage and dedication."
"They often risk a great deal, even their lives."
"We have awarded the prize to writers, journalists, politicians, professors, lawyers and organisations fighting for freedom of labour, and even associations of women fighting enforced disappearance."
"Freedom of thought is a universal value."
"I would like to use this occasion to say that the two nominations that did not receive the Sakharov Prize this year do enjoy our great support, and that we should also mention their names as persons who have made a particularly strong impression on us."
"The fact that we mentioned their names, the fact that they were with us in so many debates, speaks a great deal of our great support for what they have done."
"It is not just the winner of the prize but also the nominees who deserve our great respect and deep recognition."
"(Applause)"
"The prize giving ceremony will be on Wednesday, 16 December in Strasbourg."
"1."
"Draft general budget of the European Union - 2010 financial year (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, in the Committee on Budgets, we voted on more than 1 100 amendments to the 2010 draft budget."
"Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request be put to the vote in plenary."
"Regarding the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Committee adopted two new paragraphs to be added to budget lines 06 04 14 01, 06 04 14 02 and 06 04 14 03."
"They should be in addition to the existing budget remarks but, due to a technical error, they are shown as replacing them."
"Amendment 832 should, therefore, be adjusted accordingly."
"After verification of the margins, the vote in committee left a margin of EUR 1 775 000 in Heading 3b."
"I propose allocating this amount to the Europe for Citizens programme."
"This would mean that Amendment 889 on budget line 15 06 66 should be modified to give total commitment appropriations of EUR 32 255 000 and the retabled Amendment 547 is therefore covered."
"The words 'sustainable and environmentally-friendly actions ... (Green New Deal)' should be added to the remarks instead of the words 'Green New Deal' in the remarks adopted on the following budget lines:"
"04 02 17 ESF - Convergence"
"04 02 19 ESF - Competitiveness"
"13 03 16 ERDF - Convergence"
"13 03 18 ERDF - Competitiveness"
"Similarly, on the budget line 13 03 20 ERDF - Operational technical assistance for the European Regional Development Fund, the first two new paragraphs should be replaced by the following:"
"'Part of the appropriation is intended for financing sustainable and environmentally-friendly actions (Green New Deal) that provide for reconciling economic, social and environmental development requirements and for recovery of European regions after the economic and financial crisis'."
"The budget line number of the Pilot Project on an all-inclusive cooperation between public authorities, commercial firms and not-for-profit enterprises on integrating people into society and employment should be changed to another line, 04 03 12, for technical reasons."
"The budget line number of 'Preparatory Action - Erasmus for journalists' should be changed to 09 06 05 for technical reasons."
"If Amendment 943 on the EPSO budget line 26 01 20 is adopted, the corresponding budgetary annex for this Office should be adjusted accordingly."
"I ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes - if the plenary will support me."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, just allow me to say a word of thanks to the Secretariat for the enormous work they have done."
"This adjustment list usually features every year and represents good work from the Secretariat."
"We discussed it with the groups and coordinators and I received support for this change, which is in the spirit of the general proposal."
"The most important thing is that we in the Committee on Budgets were united in using all the legal possibilities that we have to fill up the margin almost in each heading, which means that any vote which gives additional money is risking the legality of the budget."
"I draw your attention to this and I hope that the spirit of cooperation will remain."
"We have slightly different views but this is normal."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, according to the voting lists, Amendment 464 from the Green/EFA Group will fall if Amendment 870 from the Committee on Budgets is adopted."
"The voting list follows the rule introduced in formulae by Thomas von der Vring, according to which the amendments adopted by the Committee on Budgets shall be put to the vote first in plenary, and if these are adopted, all other amendments to the same budget line fall."
"However, this practice, which is not included in Parliament's Rules of Procedure, was introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that the overall position on the budget adopted by Parliament would remain within the financial limits set for the European Parliament."
"As Amendment 464 only proposes to place funds in the reserve, it definitely cannot pose a problem of exceeding the limits."
"In fact, the two amendments are in no way mutually exclusive and can therefore definitely both be voted on."
"I therefore urge you to apply Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure and also allow a vote on Amendment 464."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the order was set previously and was carefully checked, but I would ask the rapporteur to take the floor."
"I ask you, as the most knowledgeable, to say a few words on this matter."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is not usually the rapporteur who decides on whether something is incorrect or not."
"We have a practice and a custom."
"I must inform the plenary that if we vote first on the Committee on Budgets amendments, which were not questioned by the Verts/ALE Group, then their subsequent amendment will decrease the European Regional Development Fund by EUR 300 million in payments."
"So that is a real contradiction."
"On the one hand, there would be an increase, and on the other hand, a decrease."
"We should stick to our decision, for it is written clearly in Amendment 464 that the payment is not increased."
"There is zero increase."
"Therefore, it is in conflict - there cannot be an increase of EUR 300 million and, at the same time, no increase."
"(...) so that we may proceed to the vote."
"That is the opinion of our services which investigated the matter, and of the rapporteur."
"I therefore propose that we proceed to the vote."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 812:"
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to ask for the floor pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with failure to respect the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to ask for an amendment to the order of voting, since it seems to me that the order according to the voting list violates Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I therefore ask that Amendment 70, which proposes an appropriation of EUR 600 million to support the milk sector, which is facing an extremely serious situation, as we all know, be voted on immediately before Amendment 812, which proposes an appropriation of 300 million."
"I would point out that this appropriation of EUR 600 million was unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and won broadly majority support in this House, in the last sitting on 17 September, when we voted on a resolution on supporting the milk sector and the crisis it is facing."
"Thank you."
"It is clearly a matter of the financial resources available to us, which means that the decision on this matter is a serious one."
"We would indeed like assistance, but we have to know what is available."
"The proposal here is to vote on Amendment 812 first, that is the proposal."
"I would like to ask the rapporteur to take the floor on this matter."
"How are the finances, what are the financial possibilities?"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, again, the order of vote is not my decision."
"It was stated by my colleague, Mrs Trüpel, a few minutes ago that there is a so-called informal rule that the Committee on Budget's amendment is to be voted on first."
"Why?"
"Because the Committee on Budgets is the parliamentary body in which we can measure whether we have leeway or not."
"It is not in our interest to change the rules during the voting procedure, and I am against that."
"The voting list has been distributed."
"The groups have decided how to vote."
"Any change will result in confusion and later on will produce a lot of difficulties."
"If we change our rules for one case, for whatever reason, we will be lost."
"Each body should respect its own customs, rules and regulations."
"(ES) Mr President, a technical error has occurred."
"I intended to vote against Amendment 444."
"(FR) Mr President, I perfectly understand the argument stated by the rapporteur, leading us to vote firstly on Amendment 812."
"If, however, this is merely an argument about procedure, the vote in favour of Amendment 812 did not necessarily imply that Amendment 70 had lapsed."
"It is customary in parliamentary assemblies to vote first, as Mr Capoulas Santos requested, on the amendments furthest removed from the initial text."
"We are making an exception for the reasons outlined by the rapporteur..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Thank you."
"We understand."
"We have a definitive voting procedure in place."
"I ask the rapporteur to take the floor."
"According to the services and in our view, this second amendment falls."
"Can the rapporteur confirm this?"
"rapporteur. - Even after the vote there is no reason to start the debate again."
"We are now in favour of voting."
"Mr President, this is just to be helpful."
"Some of us have been hearing different numbers being called."
"So that we avoid any misunderstandings, can we pay attention to the screen up here?"
"Just in case there are any problems with us hearing or with communication."
"I am not blaming anyone, but let us be clear and watch the screen."
"Ok."
"We will all go by the screen."
"It may be that I am reading the numbers too fast."
"I shall read them more slowly."
"Thank you."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 937:"
"Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order."
"You said a few minutes ago that you were bound by the rules, and what can you do when you are bound by the rules?"
"I fully understand that, and so does the House."
"Can I assume, and can we assume, that you will be bound by the rules of this House for your whole term of office?"
"Because your predecessor felt he was not bound by the rules, and on the basis of explanations of vote he tore the rule book up because he did not feel bound by it."
"I leave it with you, sir."
"Thank you very much."
"Ladies and gentlemen, particularly during the vote, we can only take the floor on points of order."
"Please do not raise matters other than points of order, because if you do, we cannot hold the vote."
"That is a great inconvenience to all of us."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, at a time when the national governments are having to trim their budgets and when all our constituents are having to make savings in their household budgets, how typical that the European Union, uniquely, should presume to be substantially increasing its budget."
"This is going to have immediate and tangible fiscal consequences in the Member States."
"In my own nation, for example, our budget contributions will rise by 60% over the next 12 months."
"To put that in context, my last party conference saw our party pledging to make annual savings of GBP 7 billion a year across the whole of government spending."
"We are spending twice that simply on this one item of our gross contributions to the EU budget."
"You can disguise it as stimulus spending and a reaction to the credit crunch and all the rest of it, but you know that is not true."
"What we are actually doing is taking money out of people's private pockets or purses and spending it on their behalf through bureaucracies."
"If that had been the more efficient way of allocating resources, we would have lost the Cold War."
"We now see the truth, which is that the core function of the EU is the employment of its own employees, which is why its budget always rises."
"Mr President, I would like to make it clear that I supported draft Amendments 732 and 733 and it is a pity that this House did not support them."
"I welcome any measure that prevents the funding of family planning programmes which will involve a course of abortion programmes and forced sterilisations."
"Furthermore, the mandating of those receiving funding to actively combat sex-selective gender imbalance for babies born in certain Asian countries is to be welcomed."
"This amendment would have given the opportunity for the EU to back up its words of condemnation with positive action and to deny support for such schemes."
"(CS) Mr President, I too would like to express my irritation that we have not managed to agree today on the condition that European funding in the development aid budget must not go towards activities such as family planning through enforced abortions or mandatory sterilisations."
"I would like to protest against methods under which, particularly in many Asian countries, women are forced to have abortions, especially in cases where they are carrying female babies."
"It is said that 35 million girls have been disposed of in this way."
"We must not support those who organise this kind of thing and we must stop sending them any funding from Europe."
"The underhand voting we have seen today from liberals, communists and some socialists in the adoption of our budget has blocked such an assurance."
"(HU) The multitude of proposed amendments included a textual amendment which hit the nail on the head."
"It says: 'rejects the idea of using the Community budget to finance a more militarist and neo-liberal EU.'"
"Parliament rejected this amendment."
"It thereby demonstrated that it had not learnt from the crisis of recent years and had not learnt from the conclusion reached even by the former advocates of the liberal market that it is no longer possible to continue along this path."
"The European Union's budget always relies on the supremacy of the liberal market, which can cause Europe's population such serious harm, as we have already experienced in the recent past."
"(FR) Mr President, whilst various institutes and programmes, which are all along the politically dominant lines of communication and the education or re-education of populations, have received billions of euros, a procedural trick has deprived our milk producers of the aid they were entitled to expect."
"Indeed, two amendments were submitted to us: Amendment 812, which perhaps had the Council's backing, for only EUR 300 million, and Amendment 70, for EUR 600 million."
"It makes sense that Amendment 70 should be put to the vote first."
"Moreover, this is very clearly stated in Rule 161(2) of our Rules of Procedure: 'If two or more mutually exclusive amendments have been tabled to the same part of a text, the amendment that departs furthest from the original text shall have priority and shall be put to the vote first'."
"The rapporteur cited an informal rule, but the formal rule takes precedence over supposed informal rules, and this procedure has been used to declare lapsed the second amendment that brought this allocation up to EUR 600 million."
"It is a scandal!"
"(LT) I voted for the 2010 budget, because the funds which are earmarked in this budget really will ease the situation a little for citizens of EU Member States affected by the economic, social and financial crisis."
"Moreover, in this budget, more funds have been earmarked for social needs, and this is particularly important at the current time."
"I also supported those provisions that set aside additional funds to increase employment and secure jobs."
"It is also very important that we allocated specific funds for the dairy sector."
"Of course, we could have allocated more money to the dairy sector, as representatives of the Social Democrat Party proposed, but it is good that at least some of the funds in this draft have been set aside for this."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the budget because all the items have either remained the same or been increased, when all Member States are grappling with decreasing revenue."
"And here we are spending more money in Europe!"
"That is beyond me."
"I also voted 'no' because it is now laid down that, in addition to his or her salary and the reimbursement of travel and other costs, each MEP is entitled to EUR 4 202 for general expenditure."
"Members are supposed to spend this substantial amount on office and telephone costs, for example, but not one of them is obliged to account for the way this sum is spent."
"This means that, every month, each MEP is receiving a blank cheque that would surprise even Santa Claus."
"I find this utterly reprehensible."
"If this House takes itself seriously, it must stop this practice."
"This can be done by joining me in voting against the budget, and I would also call on each Member to voluntarily scrutinise the way this EUR 4 202 is spent."
"(HU) I obviously voted in favour of the proposal intended to alleviate the crisis in the dairy sector."
"I want to emphasise again that this is just a handout which is not even enough to put out the fire."
"However, I would have considered it wrong to vote against this."
"I am disappointed and sad that I did not receive any reply, even after repeated attempts, to my three questions."
"The first question was about what the European Union wants to do to ensure that it does not continue in the future to lurch from one crisis to another, be it in the dairy sector or with similar crises elsewhere."
"What lesson has the European Union learnt from this awful crisis which has ruined and is ruining the lives of many families?"
"My second question to the Commissioner, when she was here, and therefore to the Commission as well, was how this money can be distributed to Member States or whether it is possible to do so in such a way that small producers whose livelihoods are at risk will be the first to receive it."
"My third question which I did not receive an answer to was about what action new Member States want to take against the discriminatory situation they are in."
"100% of our market had to be..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the resolution on the dairy sector: firstly, I expressly welcome the fact that the Commission can now react more quickly to market disruptions in the dairy sector."
"Secondly, I am delighted that we have together managed to grant European dairy farmers financial support."
"Thirdly, precisely because money is not everything, we must now use our time to prepare for the period after the milk quota."
"That is why I hope for intensive dialogue between politicians and the industry, because the question of how we are to configure the dairy market for dairy farmers post-2015 has still not been answered and that, from my point of view, is the main problem."
"(CS) I fully support extending the scope of Article 186 to include the milk and dairy products sector."
"This will make it possible to react flexibly to sudden changes in the global and European milk markets in order to avoid negative impacts on producers or a distortion of economic competition."
"I am doubtful, however, about the effectiveness of using quota purchasing financed from the budgets of individual Member States to solve the crisis in the milk sector."
"Not all EU states have the same possibilities when it comes to financing this measure."
"I believe that this will undermine the competitiveness of farmers in these states and therefore, of course, economic competition too."
"As an MEP from the Czech Republic I would therefore prefer in this case to see quota purchasing financed from the Community budget, which can be used by all states on an equal basis."
"I have therefore abstained from the vote."
"(PL) Mr President, after many months of waiting, after long discussions in the Committee on Agriculture, after massive farmers' protests in various Member States, we have approved additional forms of support for dairy farmers."
"Yet this is not enough, as these farmers have suffered huge losses, with many on the brink of bankruptcy, which has undermined the authority of the European Union, and of us MEPs."
"Did it have to be this way?"
"Why the Commission's belated response?"
"Does it mean that we are not monitoring the market properly?"
"If so, it speaks poorly of the state of administration in the European Union."
"We MEPs have been the ones raising this issue for months on end."
"Let us not forget that belated intervention is far less effective, and ends up costing more."
"We should learn lessons for the future from this."
"We need long-term stability for the difficult, labour-intensive and costly activity of milk production."
"It is our duty to our hard-working farmers."
"Thank you, Mr Siekierski."
"I have received another two explanations of vote, both of which are from new Members."
"I should point out that, under Rule 170, no further requests to give explanations of vote shall be accepted once the first explanation of vote has begun."
"I shall allow these two explanations as an exception, but I should like to ask the services to bring this to the attention of the groups in a suitable manner once again."
"Unless we proceed to some extent by the book, then things will get out of hand."
"Mr Seán Kelly has the floor."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I, too, am delighted that we have today voted through the budget funding for the dairy sector, which does show that the European Union listens and reacts - obviously within the limits of its budget."
"It would be better if we could have more money to give to the dairy sector but hopefully we can improve that matter in the future."
"Half a loaf is better than no bread at all."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that in the English interpretation today, a number of mistakes were made."
"Mr Buzek very kindly said that it may have been because he was speaking too quickly."
"It does not matter, and it is not a question of blaming anybody, but 908 was called 909, 444 was called 445, and 440 was called 444, so, if there are queries subsequently, that matter should be taken into consideration."
"Of course, the screen unfortunately did not work for a while either, but that was an electronic error, not a human one."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted to amend the Regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets, although I have my doubts as to whether the new way of calculating penalties for exceeding national quotas should be effective from April 1 this year."
"It means rescinding laws retrospectively, which undermines the principle of legal certainty."
"However, I have voted in favour, as this amendment will release EUR 280 million of funding for milk producers and holds out the hope that the milk producers have weathered the worst of the storm."
"There remains, however, a fundamental question regarding the future of milk production in the European Union, and within this area the most important issue is the future of milk quotas."
"At the moment, there are contradictions in the actions of the Commission."
"On the one hand, there is a proposal to increase quotas and eliminate quotas in 2015."
"On the other hand, the motion tabled today is that supply be reduced."
"We have to decide one way or the other."
"I am for a continuation of quotas."
"Mr President, the French philosopher René Descartes famously conjectured that all our senses might be being manipulated by a malicious demon."
"Sometimes when I listen to these reports, I get the impression that we are inhabiting that Cartesian universe, a world in which the European Union stands only for the values of democracy and freedom and justice and extends its values through trade accords, rather than war."
"And then, back in the real world, what is the European Union doing?"
"It is cosying up to the tyrants in Beijing and isolating Taiwan."
"It is refusing to talk to the anti-Castro dissidents in Cuba."
"It is trying to jolly the ayatollahs out of their nuclear ambitions."
"It is the chief paymaster of Hamas-controlled Palestine."
"There is no connection between this report about spreading democracy and the actual behaviour of our institutions."
"I do not say that the European Union is hypocritical because, of course, we apply the same standards within our own borders, happily swatting aside referendum results when we deem them to have gone the wrong way."
"Externally, as well as domestically, we disdain representative government and we are contemptuous of the democratic will."
"Let me repeat that the Lisbon Treaty should be put to a referendum."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"Mr President, I do not think anyone can disagree with the need to promote and support democracy throughout the world, and outside the EU as well as within the EU."
"However, if you look back at lessons from history, I remember when the United States used to go and promote democracy around the world and people would say, 'What about your own backyard, what about the African-Americans who cannot vote or who are denied the ability to vote?'"
"Years ago, Britain and other colonial masters used to say to the colonies 'Let us spread democracy', yet denied the vote to women."
"Now you look at what the EU is doing."
"The EU is talking about spreading democracy across the EU, and my colleague Mr Hannan has already given many details of such hypocrisy."
"But there is one thing that we should remember."
"When we talk about spreading democracy, let us make sure we have our own house in order."
"When the French and the Dutch voted 'no' in the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty, we said we would have a period of reflection, and then we ignored the votes."
"When the Irish voted 'no' first time round, we said 'Oh, tell you what, we agree with democracy but only if you vote the right way."
"We will give you another chance.'"
"It is time we put our own House in order."
"Mr President, once again I find myself having to remind colleagues that the European Constitution or Lisbon Treaty is not technically in force."
"Every clause, every article of the Brok report is based on that Treaty already having justiciability, which of course it does not."
"I have to say there is something a little bit suspicious about having held back this report until the Irish referendum was safely in the bag and all the votes counted, and then suddenly coming out with a proposal to have EU embassies around the world answerable to this House and a single European diplomatic corps."
"Of course, we all know the reality that an EU foreign policy exists de facto if not de jure."
"We have delegations around the world, which dwarf any of the national missions; we have, in all but name, EU ambassadors; and now once again we see that a report is belatedly regularising what had become practice over many years in the European Union."
"So now, when we object, we are told there is no point in complaining now because this has been common practice for many years."
"Thus, do European policies go from being unthinkable to inevitable without any intervening stage?"
"Mr President, I supported this resolution because I attach great importance to the upcoming EU-US Summit."
"At the recent G20 meeting, many promises were given which will be difficult to achieve if countries act on their own."
"In this regard, the EU and the US should take the leading role in the implementation of G20 commitments."
"Therefore, we need better and more effective coordination between the measures taken by the US and the EU."
"We do not need to have a strategic EU-US partnership."
"I hope that the Commission will take this request by the European Parliament on board."
"Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for their patience and I include all the interpreters, who do a wonderful job."
"We all agree on the importance of the EU-US relationship and I think we all welcome the summits and discussions at the TEC level and the various other transatlantic dialogues."
"But it really is important that we recognise that the whole world looks at these summits and looks at the moral leadership that we can offer, not only at EU level but also the US Administration."
"Surely one of the best ways of stimulating our economies, particularly in this time of crisis, is to make sure that we really live the word when we talk about open trade."
"I have been very disturbed when we look at our common agricultural policy, and we seem to be supplementing our common agricultural policy and increasing protectionism, which does great harm to farmers in the developing world."
"Also, if you look at the Obama Administration and its recent tariffs on Chinese tyres, we are descending into a spiral of protectionism."
"It is about time we went back to our principle of open trade to stimulate the world economy."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The contribution of the European budget for 2010 to encourage economic growth, competitiveness, cohesion and job protection is a vital response to the recent economic crisis."
"As a specific stimulus for the European economy, I would highlight the European Economic Recovery Plan, which encourages, among other things, projects in the energy sector (electricity grid, natural gas grid and carbon capture and storage projects), finances measures relating to broadband Internet, extending the so-called information highways to rural communities, creates a fund for the dairy farming sector, as a new challenge of the common agricultural policy, and other Community aid programmes, such as distribution of fruit and milk in schools."
"I would particularly like to highlight the amendment to the draft general budget for 2010 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which makes promoting first-time employment for young people, by means of training in association with businesses, traineeships and entrepreneurship courses, an additional objective of the Erasmus programme."
"The group of amendments to the EU's budget for 2010 which make up 'Block 3' contains interventions and support measures that I oppose as a matter of principle."
"This includes various storage measures, for example, for alcohol, and extensive EU support for the wine sector."
"It also includes EU support for milk and fruit in schools, which may well be important, but it is not something that the EU should be taking decisions on."
"At the same time, the group contains important investments in animal welfare and the control of animal transport, for example, which I welcome."
"However, since the voting procedure forces me to take a view of the group of amendments as a whole, I have chosen to abstain from voting on Block 3."
"Amendment 886 has a commendable purpose - investment in sport."
"However, this matter does not belong at EU level."
"I therefore voted against it."
"Amendment 905 is based on an attitude to migrants that I cannot accept on principle."
"For example, funds are to be provided to explain to people living in Africa how dangerous it is to get to Europe."
"We should not build walls around our continent."
"I therefore voted against this amendment."
"Amendment 909 contains resources for monitoring European citizens."
"This is something that I cannot accept and I therefore voted against it."
"in writing. - UKIP members voted in favour of these amendments fundamentally because we oppose ANY increase in the budget and because the limitation in the use of these budget lines, as proposed by the ECR, may result in a reduction in payments out of the budget."
"However, we wish to emphasise also that EU-money, which is amply funded by the British taxpayer, should not be used to impose policies, such as coercive abortion, on minority- and other populations, which are suffering under anti-democratic regimes."
"Such use is against the law in the UK."
"It is also against the law in other client-states of the EU, and in contravention of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights of the United Nations, to which the UK is a signatory, and against the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the UK is also a signatory."
"Whether or not the sum involved runs into millions, the local populations affected would have been justified in associating the UKIP with the tyranny of their own governments, if the UKIP delegation had voted against these amendments."
"I voted in favour of Amendment 812 of Block 3 so as not to penalise the aid for dairy farmers, however ridiculous it may be (EUR 280 million)."
"However, it is unacceptable that the adoption of this amendment should lead to the rejection of Amendment 70, which grants aid of EUR 600 million instead of EUR 280 million, as Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting."
"I protest against this rule of the lowest budget proposal at the expense of farmers."
"I believe the measures announced by Commissioner Fischer Boel at the end of the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg, and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in Strasbourg (on 19 October), are inadequate."
"The package, which is still to be approved by the Ecofin Council on 19 November, amounts to EUR 280 million and will be provided to Member States in the form of a financial envelope, based on production and annual quotas."
"According to the calculations, Portugal will receive a financial envelope of EUR 6 to 7 million to tackle the drop in producer prices, which is more than 50% in relation to 2007-2008 prices."
"I believe that EUR 0.003 per litre of milk produced in Portugal (calculations provided by producers) is a pittance for a problem that has been dragging on now for so many months, especially if the Minister for Agriculture uses this money for the expected reforms, as he has already announced."
"This sum of EUR 280 million sends an important signal from the European Commission, but it is inadequate compared with what producers actually need to overcome the crisis."
"Negotiation of the budget is among the most important Community processes in which Parliament, the Commission and the Council share decision-making power."
"Today, on completion of the first reading, Parliament is reasserting its role as budgetary authority by successfully increasing both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations in relation to the Council's proposal, though still by less than we would like."
"Crucial issues that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has been supporting with regard to reviving European economies in the context of the current crisis have now been endorsed, by means of an emphasis on the cohesion policy to promote growth and competitiveness, especially of SMEs, the main driving force of job creation."
"As a Portuguese Social Democrat MEP, I have reason to be particularly pleased with the approval, by a large majority, of an amendment from our delegation, which is aimed at creating an Erasmus programme for first-time employment, one of the proposals that we tabled in the last European elections."
"Support for milk producers and a guarantee of more security for citizens, including with regard to energy supply, have also been safeguarded."
"This is not the end of the process, as the three institutions will have to reach a common position that will be voted on at second reading in December."
"Against the current backdrop of economic, financial and social crisis, it was essential for the budget of the European Union for 2010 to place a special emphasis on this situation and for it to become an effective tool to overcome the crisis."
"I therefore voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2010, as I believe that it comprehensively responds to these needs."
"Parliament is determined to do all it can to guarantee adequate financing for all activities and policies which encourage growth and job creation, and which provide solutions for European citizens."
"More specifically, this means improved energy security, increased support for research and innovation, particularly in the area of clean technologies, promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and increased support for lifelong learning."
"In this regard, as proposed by the Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs, I wish to highlight the importance of creating an Erasmus employment programme, aimed at young people seeking first-time employment, to help achieve these goals."
"Lastly, I must stress that I do not agree with the Council's additional reductions in the budget headings in support of the Lisbon Strategy, given that such cuts go against what should be done to encourage growth and economic recovery."
"Whilst cohesion policy plays an essential role in efforts to combat the economic crisis and climate change, the Council had proposed substantially reducing the payment appropriations allocated to it in 2010."
"Aware as we are of the importance of European funds and of the expectation that exists on the ground, it was essential for we MEPs to re-establish, or even in some cases increase, the amounts suggested in advance by the European Commission."
"This vote is the expression of the political Europe that we need, one that is capable of taking budgetary decisions that ensure a good future for solidarity, competitiveness and growth, for the benefit of its citizens."
"The MEPs have today confirmed their support for a European cohesion policy that really does have the resources to meet its ambitions."
"Approving also of the general direction of the reports by Mr Surján and Mr Maňka on the European Union's draft budget for the 2010 financial year, it is therefore with determination that I have voted in favour of their adoption."
"I support the Surján report as a possible compromise with regard to the EU budget."
"I regret that the Council has reduced yet further the Commission's preliminary draft budget, which, in my opinion, already fell short of what is needed."
"We cannot have more Europe with a meagre budget that is clearly inadequate."
"I particularly disagree with the cuts made in the budget headings in support of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The discrepancy between the public declarations to prioritise tackling the economic crisis and supporting 'competitiveness for growth and employment', and the appropriations provided for in this draft budget, could not be greater."
"I welcome the increased appropriations in the area of freedom, security and justice and I would stress that building a Europe of citizens also depends on proper implementation of these budget headings."
"I did not vote in favour of creating a EUR 300 million fund and for immediate support targeted at milk producers as I believe that the producers of dairy products are facing a collapse in prices, which is causing insecurity."
"In fact, the position adopted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) for a EUR 600 million fund would have been a quicker and more effective means of combating the causes and, above all, the effects which have led to a significant decline in the dairy product market, which is continuing in the context of the current economic crisis."
"I also believe that the set of support measures adopted by the European Commission has come too late."
"Indeed, the EUR 600 million fund would have provided real support for the Member States facing this crisis."
"The group of amendments to the EU's budget for 2010 which make up 'Block 3' contains interventions and support measures that we oppose as a matter of principle (in the same way as we are critical of - and vote against - EU support for tobacco growing)."
"This includes various storage measures, for example, for alcohol, and extensive EU support for the wine sector."
"It also includes EU support for milk and fruit in schools, which in itself is important, but we believe this matter should instead be dealt with at national level."
"At the same time, the Block 3 group of amendments contains important investments in animal welfare and the control of animal transport, for example, which we would, in principle, welcome, as we strongly support these issues in other contexts, but since the voting procedure forces us to take a view of the group of amendments as a whole, we have chosen to abstain from voting on Block 3."
"I believe the increases proposed by Parliament for the different headings and the amount of EUR 1.5 billion to finance the European Economic Recovery Plan are vital for the EU to recover from the economic crisis we are in, as well as to strengthen the European Union's role on the world stage."
"As I have said before, I believe it is particularly crucial to allocate necessary funds so that small and medium-sized enterprises, which are among the main victims of the crisis, have support that enables them to survive this crisis."
"The increase relating to the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme will make it possible to promote the enterprising spirit and the innovation vital for the EU to assert itself in the global market and for socio-economic development in the internal market."
"I regret, however, that only EUR 300 million has been allocated for the creation of a fund for the dairy farming sector."
"In my view, the serious crisis that the sector is currently experiencing would justify the allocation of more funds, initially EUR 600 million, to help producers overcome the difficulties they are currently facing."
"I therefore believe that EUR 300 million is inadequate and I hope that allocation of this sum can still be substantially revised, in light of the needs of the parties affected by this decision."
"As regards Parliament's position, I would like to highlight: a) the amendments to reallocate the funds tabled by the Commission and later withdrawn by the Council; b) the European Economic Recovery Plan as a priority for the European Parliament, which must provide 'fresh' money for its funding; c) the proposals to step up funding for energy security, research and development, support for SMEs, and lifelong learning; d) the creation of a fund for the milk sector to the value of EUR 300 million, an inadequate amount, but the maximum sum possible (I believe it is vital to have a mechanism to regulate and maintain milk quotas); e) funding of broadband for rural communities from the margin available under heading 2; f) the draft amendment we tabled to strengthen and change the Erasmus programme, to make it also an instrument to create first-time employment opportunities for young people."
"I hope that the total budget with payment values in the order of EUR 127 billion is used in full, given that there is a delay in implementing funds equal to a financial year."
"In the midst of an economic and social crisis, with drastic effects for jobs and people's living conditions, the draft Community budget for 2010, which we are discussing today, falls very short of what is required and, once again, shows what 'European solidarity' really means."
"Instead of responding to the social crisis, a significant portion of the budget is set aside for increasing military spending and for supporting economic and financial groups, in keeping with the escalation of the European Union's militaristic and neoliberal tendencies."
"Although it represents an increase in relation to the draft budget of the Council and of the European Commission, Parliament's proposal still falls short of what was allocated for 2010 in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 by around EUR 6 billion, while the final amount - to be decided in December - is still unknown."
"We welcome, however, the approval of our proposal to create a new budget heading for actions in the textile and footwear industry, with a view to creating a Community programme for the industry."
"This proposal is aimed at tackling the crisis in the industry, resulting from the exponential increase in imports from third countries, particularly in the regions most dependent on the sector."
"Regarding the EU budget for 2010, we support the basic principles behind it and wish to emphasise that it needs to give people good value for money."
"The framework set up under the financial perspective should be respected, and we therefore welcome the fact that the budget will be kept well within this framework."
"We want to cut back on agricultural and regional aid dramatically and reduce the total budget."
"We want to put more of our shared resources into research and development, growth, infrastructure and security."
"I would like to begin by expressing my regret that the Council has reduced yet further the Commission's preliminary draft budget and that, despite the assumption that the priority of the 2010 budget is citizens and tackling the economic crisis, there is not adequate funding under heading 1a - Competitiveness for Growth and Employment. The budget cuts made by the Council take funds away from implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which runs counter to tackling the current economic crisis."
"I would, however, like to welcome the fact that the amendment made by the Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs, which was an election promise to Portuguese voters, has been approved, in that it concerns the creation of the Erasmus first-time employment concept as a way of promoting employment for young people and helping tackle the economic crisis."
"Lastly, I disagree with the cuts made by the Council in heading 1b - Cohesion for Growth and Employment, at a time when the Structural and Cohesion Funds are important to encourage growth and economic recovery, but also because a large number of important policies aimed at fighting climate change and supporting growth and employment are funded under this sub-heading."
"I voted in favour of setting up a new fund for dairy products which will provide support to producers in their efforts to overcome the crisis in this sector, although this support should have been envisaged much earlier."
"I regret that we could not vote to obtain EUR 600 million as was envisaged by the own-initiative report voted for on 1 September by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and as the S&D Group would have wished."
"If EU farmers cannot enjoy more support from the EU, this is down to ill feeling from the European right."
"in writing. - The proposed anti-grassroots EU budget for 2010 reflects every aspect of its reactionary objectives, proving yet again that the EU is a transnational imperialist union in the service of capital."
"The capitalist crisis is being used to make deep, reactionary, capitalist restructurings at the expense of the working classes and to increase the profits of monopoly undertakings."
"Programmes are being financed to overturn labour relations, trample on labour and social rights, promote flexible forms of work and overturn the terms of collective agreements."
"Systems of insecure work and holding young people to ransom with internships and lifelong learning rather than jobs are being strengthened."
"The concentration of land and the uprooting of farmers from the application of the CAP are being strengthened for the benefit of the food industry and trade."
"The means and mechanisms of prosecuting and repressing the labour movement, such as Frontex, Europol and Eurojust, are being increased and strengthened, as are personal databases and mechanisms for imposing the EU's imperialist policy, the common foreign and security policy, and military infrastructures."
"The vote in favour of the EU budget by the centre right and centre left parties in the European Parliament marks an all-out attack on the working classes."
"We voted against the EU budget because it serves big business, causing even greater hardship for the peoples."
"in writing. - British Conservatives continue to believe in better value and greater accountability within the European Parliament budget."
"However, once again the Parliament has sought to greatly increase the budget beyond that set by the Council of Ministers."
"Therefore, Conservatives have voted to decrease many areas of EU spending."
"We continue to support areas where the EU adds value, such as research into new technologies, access to information for EU citizens, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Auditors."
"However, we have also voted against a large number of other budget lines which are unjustified and wasteful in a time when we should all be showing economic prudence."
"Specifically, we have voted against funding for the Committee of the Regions, and we have supported moves to scrap some of the most profligate budget lines such as tobacco subsidies, as well as a number of other lines regarding agricultural subsidies and schemes, and waste in administration."
"in writing. - The ECR Group believe in better value and greater accountability within the European Parliament budget."
"However, once again, the Parliament has sought to greatly increase the budget beyond that set by the Council of Ministers."
"Therefore, the ECR have voted to decrease many areas of EU spending."
"We continue to support areas where the EU adds value, such as research into new technologies, access to information for EU citizens, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Auditors."
"However, we have also voted against a large number of other budget lines which are unjustified and wasteful in a time when we should all be showing economic prudence."
"Specifically, we have voted against funding for the Committee of the Regions, and have supported moves to reduce some of the most profligate budget lines regarding agricultural subsidies and schemes, and waste in administration."
"In this debate on the general budget of the European Union, I am in favour of the specific conditions of the crisis that we are currently experiencing being taken into account when we discuss the allocation of funds to the various sectors of the European economy."
"I would like to draw attention to the pressing need to create a fund for the dairy farming sector in view of the difficult circumstances faced by producers, and I hope that effective support measures are adopted for this sector of activity."
"It is vital to allocate the necessary funds so that small and medium-sized enterprises, which are among the main victims of the crisis, have support that enables them to survive this crisis."
"The increase for the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme will make it possible to promote the enterprising spirit and the innovation that are vital for the EU to assert its position in the global market and for socio-economic development in the internal market."
"I welcome the fact that the policy of zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each legislative term, which I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), has been adopted."
"As a result, Parliament's budget will reflect real needs and will increase transparency, budgetary discipline and efficiency."
"I also support a distinction between fixed costs and variable costs, with the latter justified by a cost-benefit analysis."
"In areas such as communication policy, this cost-benefit analysis is important to ensure better results and resource management."
"I would stress that this draft budget does not take account of requirements arising from the future entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which will probably require the drafting of an amending budget."
"I would highlight that excellence in lawmaking should be Parliament's main priority, and the necessary resources should be allocated to this end."
"I also believe that it is vital to adopt a long-term policy on buildings, which should take account of building maintenance costs."
"I voted in favour of the first reading of the 2010 budget, that is EUR 127.5 billion in payments, whilst hoping that the second reading will enable us to achieve more ambitious results, in particular, regarding the resources afforded for a recovery plan that is in proportion to the challenges to be confronted in terms of jobs, social cohesion, climate change and the fight against poverty."
"It was for me, above all, a matter of defending support for microcredit, which is a priority for the socialists, by providing resources for the social economy whilst maintaining the PROGRESS programme in its entirety."
"The resources for this budget are indeed limited, due in particular to the restricted financial perspective of which it forms part."
"Serious efforts will need to be undertaken in the discussion of the new budgetary perspective."
"I welcome the fact that the total amount of Parliament's budget is below the self-imposed limit of 20% of expenditure under heading 5 (administrative expenditure) of the multiannual financial framework."
"In a year of crisis, it is important for Parliament to project an image of discipline and cost control."
"The approved budget does not include adjustments that may be necessary if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, particularly with regard to legislation."
"In this regard, there may have to be an amending budget should the Treaty of Lisbon enter into force."
"It is important to note that Parliament's main priority is its legislative role (in the opinion of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)) and that Parliament should be allocated the necessary resources so that it can do excellent work."
"As regards information policy, I welcome the agreement on funding for political parties at European level and for political foundations at European level, which should help improve communication with citizens and their participation in EU political life."
"It also calls for a more in-depth discussion on the long-term budgetary principals in this area."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I would like to welcome the fact that the total level of Parliament's budget is below the self-imposed limit of 20% of expenditure under heading 5 (administrative expenditure) of the multiannual financial framework."
"It is important, however, to note that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the consequent increase in Parliament's responsibilities, means an amending budget will have to be drafted and the limit of 20% of administrative expenditure will be difficult to maintain."
"Parliament's main priority should be excellence in lawmaking and the necessary conditions should be created for this to become a reality."
"I would also like to applaud the work carried out by the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), José Manuel Fernandes, who was instrumental in making this report a document of great importance for Parliament."
"Of his work, I would like to highlight the proposal, which has just been approved, to implement a policy of zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each legislative term, which will enable Parliament's budget to reflect only real costs, and will increase transparency, budgetary discipline and efficiency."
"Since 1998, Parliament has consistently rejected all initiatives submitted to it when consulted about detailed issues relating to Europol, so long as Europol has remained intergovernmental in scope, subject to neither democratic nor legal control."
"Now that this decision to turn Europol into an EU agency, funded by the Community budget, has been approved and Parliament's supervisory role has been enhanced, it is no longer necessary to maintain this course of action."
"I therefore voted in favour of this initiative by the Czech Republic, which is aimed at responding to an administrative issue, namely adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff, so as to adapt them to the increase in the cost of living in the Netherlands."
"I would highlight, however, that any decision on adjusting the salaries of Europol employees must be made unanimously by the Council."
"I voted for this proposal for a decision aimed at adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff."
"This report thus aims to adjust their remunerations to the increase in the cost of living in the Netherlands, as well as to the changes in salaries in the public service in the Member States."
"This support has been even more necessary since Europol became a European Union agency funded by the Community budget."
"I voted in favour of including milk in Article 186 in order to enable the Commission to respond rapidly to crisis situations, since it introduces an instrument that is important to use."
"However, use of this instrument must not distance Parliament from this process, all the more so as codecision draws closer, which is why it is vital that the Commission oversees these actions."
"As regards voluntary adjustment of the additional levy scheme, commonly referred to as 'fines', intended to secure internal funding to restructure the dairy farming sector, I believe that it is a measure that creates national responses although, in my view, it would be more appropriate to adopt European responses to a crisis that concerns Europe as a whole."
"In conclusion, I believe that having fought so hard over recent months to have measures put forward by the Commission, we are in no position to reject any contribution at this very difficult time for European milk producers and their families."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of these changes to the Single CMO because I believe that the EUR 280 million package is realistic and will be positively received by the dairy industry."
"I am therefore persuaded that it will be necessary to grant temporary powers to the Management Committee under Article 186 in order to deliver this support."
"However, I believe that the Commission should enjoy these powers for only a maximum of two years in order to ensure the smooth delivery of this package."
"I cannot, however, support the national milk quota buy-back scheme that the Commission also proposed and which included plans to raise a superlevy on producers exceeding quota."
"We should not be penalising the efficient, who are the future of the industry."
"This package is a short-term measure to address a short-term solution, yet the industry needs a clear long-term strategy for the future."
"With regard to the inclusion of milk under Article 186 and the quota buy-back scheme, I am delighted that the implementation of this decision has not been deferred to a later date... something which, at a certain point, we might have feared on the part of some because the milk year (which runs from 1 April to 31 March) is already well under way!"
"Whilst I am in favour of the measures that have been suggested, I would nevertheless like to go further: indeed, these measures are still far from being adequate, especially since, with regard to the buy-back quota, the ball is again back in the court of the Member States and national funding."
"What is more, we are talking here about medium- and long-term measures."
"However, there is an urgent need for short-term Community measures."
"This is essential: expectations in the field in this regard are very high."
"Finally, within the context of Article 186, it will, in future, be necessary to monitor the annual renewal of the mechanism and to afford the Commission the opportunity of renewing this measure automatically each year."
"This will also enable Parliament and the Council to put greater pressure on the Commission."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a 'Single CMO' regulation since, in view of the serious crisis that the milk sector is experiencing in Europe, urgent measures are required to restore market balances and to guarantee an adequate income for farmers, as stated in the objectives of the CAP, which were reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These proposals are an acknowledgment of the failure of the Commission's policy for the dairy farming sector."
"There are several reasons why we voted against: 1) the amount proposed by the Commission to stabilise the milk market is clearly insufficient and will only be made available in 2010, therefore not making it possible to tackle, to the extent that would be required, a clearly urgent situation, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized producers; 2) inclusion of milk and dairy products under Article 186, which appears in this proposal, guarantees the Commission power, assigned by Parliament and by the Council, without specifying the actions that will be developed; 3) the proposed measures do not change the objectives of the last CMO reform to completely liberalise and dismantle market regulatory instruments, quotas and production rights - guidelines that lie at the root of the current crisis; 4) the approved funds are, above all, intended for restructuring of the sector which, for the Commission, means thousands of producers abandoning their activity, with all the social and environmental consequences that go with it; 5) the proposal will exacerbate existing imbalances in the distribution of funds among producers and among countries, which will only make things worse for countless producers."
"I voted in favour of new anti-crisis measures on the price of milk in order to support the producers who are currently struggling in a particularly difficult environment for their profession."
"These measures were slow in coming, even though milk producers have been talking about their problems since last spring."
"The EUR 280 million budget proposed by the Member States is inadequate; we must show that we are more ambitious and support an aid package of EUR 600 million to allow our producers to emerge from the slump in which they find themselves."
"I am extremely concerned about the future of this sector since nothing is being done to free producers from the grip of market mechanisms alone, even though the European Court of Auditors has announced the need for tools to manage the milk market, at the risk of undermining milk production in a large number of vulnerable areas and of failing to see that it is through high added-value products that Europe can position itself in the world market."
"in writing. - Dairy farmers are under serious pressure right now."
"In Ireland, where the dairy industry is strategically important, almost every dairy farmer in 2009 will be making a loss."
"This is not a sustainable situation for one of Europe's key industries."
"I voted on today's amendment to show solidarity with the farming community at a time of crisis."
"My only regret is that we are not voting to give them EUR 600 million instead of EUR 300 million as was originally suggested by this house."
"However the vote on that matter was blocked at committee level by the centre right parties in the parliament."
"EUR 300 million is better than nothing but more drastic action is needed in future to support this industry."
"in writing. - I abstained in the final vote on the Single CMO Regulation (Rule 142) because the proposed measures from the Commission do not go far enough in my opinion."
"The crisis in the dairy sector is a problem that needs urgent action, and that is also why I voted in favour of the urgent procedure under Rule 142 for the Single CMO Regulation adjustments."
"However, the current Commission proposal is too weak and I would like to see, in the very short term, adequate and supporting measures that are effective in combating the crisis in the dairy sector."
"Voting in favour of this proposal would preclude any future, more effective, measures."
"The crisis in the dairy industry has brought numerous farmers to the brink of bankruptcy."
"After months of waiting for better milk prices, the European Commission has finally taken emergency measures to save dairy producers."
"Aid for private stocks of cheese is to be increased to EUR 15 million, which will mainly benefit the Italians."
"The intervention period for milk powder and butter is to be extended and export refunds are to be increased."
"These measures should stabilise milk prices in the medium term."
"A milk fund of around EUR 280 million is to be distributed to the Member States in order to finance national aid measures."
"However, this is little more than a drop in the ocean."
"The Commission is offering the Member States a voluntary quota buy-back scheme in order to motivate milk producers to partially or definitively give up milk production."
"Productive operations that deliver too much are to be asked to dig deeper into their pockets."
"These measures involve a high national cost because in times of general economic crisis, there is no margin left in the national budgets."
"I have no high hopes here."
"The most tangible measure in the crisis package is the inclusion of milk in Article 186 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, so that the Commission can take fast measures to combat the crisis."
"However, it would seem questionable to me to limit this measure in time."
"With this reservation, I voted in favour of Parliament's position."
"I voted against the resolution on the dairy sector, as I think that the Commission's proposal of allocating EUR 280 million to the sector comes too late to be implemented this year and, in any case, this measure will not be sufficient."
"For this reason, I have given my support to the proposal to allocate EUR 600 million to the sector."
"On the other hand, including milk and milk derivatives in Article 186 grants certain powers to the Committee set up by the European Parliament and to the Council, although no specific indication has been given of what practical action is to be taken."
"Nevertheless, the measures adopted do not change the aim of the most recent reform of the CAP, namely the complete liberalisation of the dairy market, which our Group rejects."
"These measures favour the agro-food industry and the large distribution chains, to the detriment of smaller and medium-sized producers, and contribute to the concentration of production and an increase in the profit made by the industry, which has grown in recent years, thanks to a drop in the prices paid to milk producers and an increase in the final purchase price."
"I supported the creation of a 'milk fund' to help the sector in crisis, and specifically to come to the aid of those farmers facing the most urgent problems."
"In particular, I voted for the amendment requesting EUR 20 million more than the amount announced by the European Commission, bringing it up to EUR 300 million."
"This is an amendment to the Single Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets (CMO) Regulation enabling, in particular, the European Commission to take emergency measures on its own initiative in the event of serious disruption in the milk market, as has been the case for several months now."
"This budget is clearly not enough to get all the producers out of the tricky situation they are in."
"However, given the current budgetary margins, it would unfortunately have been irresponsible to have asked for more."
"In addition, in asking for more, we also ran the risk of getting nothing at all."
"I would point out that these are only foundations that have been laid."
"The debate continues with regard to the regulatory structure that will need to be put in place after 2013 and, on this matter, the European Parliament will pursue its efforts to arrive at an effective, responsible framework for the agricultural markets."
"In addition, the Treaty of Lisbon will provide us with new weapons in this regard."
"Reports have been adopted in Parliament's plenary sitting in Strasbourg containing three specific measures (EUR 280 million in direct aid for producers, a temporary rule for calculating buy-back of quotas and inclusion of milk in the CMO under Article 186 (emergency measures))."
"I believe that these measures are important, but they are inadequate, one-off measures for a problem that has already taken on very serious structural proportions."
"The sector needs useful and effective management mechanisms so it can intervene in the market when necessary, as opposed to the approach recommended by the European Commission, which supports liberalisation and deregulation."
"This crisis in the dairy farming sector has plainly shown that the CMO for milk still requires instruments, particularly the quota mechanism, in order to tackle market imbalances."
"The package, which is still to be approved by the Ecofin Council on 19 November, amounts to EUR 280 million and will be provided in the form of a financial envelope to Member States, based on production and annual quotas."
"According to the calculations, Portugal will receive a financial envelope of EUR 6 to 7 million to combat the collapse in production prices, which is more than 50% in relation to 2007-2008 prices ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The Commission's and the governments' measures for the crisis in the livestock farming sector go hand in glove with the more general anti-grassroots CAP and, more importantly, the decision taken by the EU on the full liberalisation of the dairy market."
"The most serious thing is that the proposed headings are being used to speed up restructurings to boost the profits of the food industry, thereby strengthening the business groups of the dairy sector at the expense of livestock farmers."
"The measures do not address the acute problems that small and medium-sized dairy farm owners have been demonstrating against: namely, the high costs of production and derisory producer prices."
"More to the point, they do not address the acute problems of all livestock farmers, in cattle breeding, in meat production and in sheep- and goat-farming."
"Industrialists and merchants are doubling their profits, both from derisory producer prices and from the exponential prices paid by workers for these staple foodstuffs."
"We voted against the proposal, because its objective is to further concentrate production in this sector."
"The solution for poor and medium-sized farm owners is to fight against the monopoly-friendly policy of the EU and for a different type of development which liberates livestock farmers from exploitation, guarantees them an income and future and generally serves the nutritional needs and well-being of the people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the European Union's internal borders were abolished without, at the same time, and even beforehand, external border controls being strengthened and the initially envisaged security instruments, however minimal, being fully operational, presents a real problem."
"Subject as we are to the principle of reality, we will not oppose this resolution, in which concern is expressed about the delays incurred by the new systems for exchanging information on criminal and visa-related matters."
"However, all that is, in fact, just a pretend problem: the real problem is Schengen itself, its pseudo-acquis now included in the treaties, and the policies conducted by Brussels in relation to visas, immigration and the movement of persons..."
"Today, Europe is awash with legal and illegal immigrants, and crime, which is becoming increasingly violent, is soaring, because the nations have been stripped of the right to control their own borders."
"Schengen has encouraged a boom in cross-border crime and in the illegal flows of persons and of goods, which themselves are sometimes legal and sometimes not, without any real benefit for Europeans."
"Therefore, until these systems become operational, at least invoke the safeguard clause and re-establish the controls!"
"I fully support the resolution on the situation as regards SIS II and VIS."
"The development of SIS II has overrun, and numerous technical hitches have already delayed the entry of new countries into the Schengen system."
"This calls for constant monitoring by the European Parliament of progress in the establishment of SIS II and VIS."
"SIS II is a key political project for the entire Union."
"Its long-awaited implementation and proper operation is essential for the further expansion of the Schengen area, and for the resulting free movement of people within the EU by the next citizens to be entitled to do so (Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus and Liechtenstein)."
"SIS II is also a key element in combating crime and illegal immigration."
"Polish border guards managed to detain 50% more illegal aliens in the first half of 2008 compared with the same period the previous year thanks to Poland joining the Schengen area (from a 2008 report of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration)."
"Over 350 people wanted under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) have been arrested on Polish territory and some 600 people wanted by the Polish justice system have been detained abroad."
"The database of missing children, which was not in SIS I and is planned for SIS II, is particularly important."
"Our trustworthiness in the eyes of our citizens depends on major projects such as these."
"A united Europe cannot afford further delays and negligence."
"Adoption of this resolution cannot fail to prompt a couple of comments on its aims and content."
"Firstly, the European Union, instead of claiming to be a champion of democracy, which it is not, and making 'practical recommendations' to other countries, should, first of all, concern itself with the state of democracy within the EU."
"The process of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is a recent example, among other possible examples, of how the so-called 'European project' goes against the democratic participation of the European peoples and against their interests, wishes and aspirations, pressuring them, blackmailing them and disregarding their decisions regarding the route they want their collective future to take."
"Secondly, in terms of its external relations, instead of promoting the revival of the arms race and militarisation of international relations, EU countries should contribute to democracy by promoting a genuine policy of peace and international cooperation, based on respect for the sovereignty of each country and the principle of non-interference, as well as respect for international law and the United Nations Charter."
"We are, unfortunately, a long way from this contribution being made."
"An EU with an increasingly stark democratic deficit cannot set an example and, much less, help 'consolidate' democracy in the world; hence our vote against."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution exposes, as usual, the so-called good intentions of this House regarding human rights: the European Union's role is seemingly to enlighten mankind as a whole as to its notions of democracy, to finance the democratic developments in all countries, and so on."
"How, then, can it be credible, this Union that applies in such a half-hearted manner, if at all, the safeguard clauses that do nonetheless exist on this subject, in all its foreign trade agreements, when it continues to trade and to finance, no matter what?"
"How can it be credible, given the way in which it acts even in Europe, imposing on the nations a European constitution, rechristened the Treaty of Lisbon, when some of them clearly stated that they did not want it?"
"And how can you, ladies and gentlemen on the left of this Parliament, be credible after yesterday's dreadful farce concerning Italy, where you demonstrated a sectarian and partisan spirit the like of which has never been seen before?"
"I voted in favour of the Brok report on the institutional aspects of setting up the European External Action Service (EEAS), which will be extremely important if the Union's external relations are to be rendered more consistent and effective."
"It is important to ensure that setting up the EEAS, as a result of the innovations introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, will make it possible to preserve and further develop the Community model in the Union's external relations and maintain the Union's interinstitutional balance."
"Setting up the European External Action Service is the natural corollary of the process whereby the European Union is acquiring more and more external competences."
"It could become an important instrument for coordination and for the EU to assert its position externally if it can resist the pressures from the directorates and base its action more on working with the diplomatic representations of Member States than competing against them."
"I regret that, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it has not been possible to gain support for an amendment that I proposed, which called for European world languages to be considered when establishing the future internal language arrangements of the EEAS."
"This is all the more clear since the priority of the EEAS should be to establish bridges, contacts and links with the rest of the world, and it should therefore adopt, as its chosen work tools, the most suitable languages for establishing them directly."
"It is therefore incomprehensible that, in considering this issue, Parliament is choosing to disregard the external aspect of multilingualism and the strategic nature of those languages, which is acknowledged not only by itself, but also by the European Commission."
"I endorsed the European Parliament's opinion on the structure of the future EU diplomatic service."
"I hope that the European External Action Service (EEAS) will embody an essentially Community-based approach and will enable the EU to exert its diplomatic influence effectively and democratically."
"The EEAS must come under the Commission for administrative and budgetary matters and must be officially part of the Commission."
"I also hope that the new commissioner for development will be able to remain fully autonomous and to safeguard his prerogatives with regard to this service, as opposed to the idea that he could concentrate powers in sectors relating to the European Union's external action, including EU trade policy and EU enlargement."
"It is important for Parliament's voice to be heard by the Council, which should lay down the guidelines for this new body in its meeting of 29-30 October 2009."
"in writing. I voted against Mr Brok's report on the European External Action Service (EEAS), as I view it to be the clearest example of the militarisation of the European Union."
"The service, which is to be launched following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, covers all aspects of EU security and defence policy."
"According to the report, the EEAS and the High Representative (and Vice-President of the European Commission) will assume the role of EU external representatives, supported by a network of 5 000 civil servants, without being subject to any kind of parliamentary control."
"The High Representative will be in charge of the civil and military management of crises and will be responsible for human rights, but will not be accountable to the Member States."
"Furthermore, the EEAS will be established by a Council Decision, with the Commission's approval."
"Parliament will merely be consulted, which reflects the anti-democratic nature of the scheme."
"I think that the European External Action Service is not in the spirit of the European project that our Group wishes to defend, namely a Europe created for and by the citizens, rather than the Europe that is currently being built on an economic model based on avoiding any intervention in the economy."
"in writing. The EU European External Action Service (EEAS), set up under the reactionary Treaty of Lisbon, is a mechanism for promoting increased imperialist aggression and the EU's anti-grassroots strategy."
"The rush by the political representatives of capital in the European Parliament - conservatives, social democrats, liberals and greens alike - to vote for the EEAS proves their devotion to the economic policies and military options of euro-unifying capital:"
"• independent representation of the EU at all international organisations, independently of its Member States, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon;"
"• establishment of the EEAS, an autonomous EU service, with civil and military powers, based on the directions taken in the CFSP and the APCA and manned by senior civil and military servants of the EU under the orders of the High Representative;"
"• use of the EEAS as a tool to promote the imperialist policy of the EU with its own embassies and diplomatic action independent of the Member States."
"The way was paved for these developments in the Treaty of Maastricht, which founded the EU CFSP and APCA and signalled an escalation in military aggression and the militarisation of the EU."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the report, which reveals every aspect of the Treaty of Lisbon and the dangers which its application harbours for the people, who are fighting against the EU, this transnational union of capital and its anti-grassroots policy."
"I did not take part in this vote because I reject the idea of strengthening our economic relations with the United States yet again."
"The EU-US partnership is not the most important for Europe and is not what the Doha Round needs: the EU must diversify its choice of partners if it wants to keep as much of its independence as possible."
"To do so, it must increase the number of agreements with developing countries."
"Rather than Americanising European standards, we must prioritise the introduction of a multipolar development model in which Europe will at last find its rightful place and full meaning."
"EU-US relations undoubtedly represent the EU's most important strategic partnership."
"We have a shared responsibility to promote common values, such as respect for human rights, democracy, stability and peace, but also to find better solutions to various global dangers and challenges, as is the case with the economic and financial crisis, climate change, nuclear proliferation, fighting international crime and terrorism, and eradicating poverty, among other issues."
"With regard to cooperation in the judicial, policing, and internal and external security areas, I would point out that, for future negotiations to be successful, it is vital that security measures do not violate civil liberties and fundamental rights, not to mention the need to respect privacy and data protection."
"I would repeat, once again, that European personal data should only be transferred to third countries if two fundamental principles have been considered: necessity and proportionality."
"Full compliance with European and national legislation on data protection should also be taken into account and adequate procedural guarantees provided."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the upcoming EU-US Summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) Meeting as it highlights the need to strengthen transatlantic relations at a time when major international challenges call for a coordinated global response."
"I would highlight the TEC's role in promoting and ensuring a coordinated response to the global financial crisis and the importance of transatlantic relations in reaching an international agreement at the COP 15 in Copenhagen, which includes an adequate financial package to help developing countries fight climate change, in terms of both mitigation measures and adaptation measures."
"Owing to the strategic importance of the United States for the EU, and vice versa, a transatlantic partnership should be strengthened at the next summit so as to consolidate the ability to take action to deal with the challenges currently facing us, from the current serious socio-economic crisis, to issues such as disarmament, the fight against terrorism, climate change, respect for human rights, etc."
"Coordinated action between the US and the EU is also vital to reach a more mature stage in economic and trade relations between both sides, leading to the creation of a de facto transatlantic market by 2015, with reduced bureaucracy and, as a result, a more stable and attractive environment for businesses in both markets, which offers them lower operating costs."
"Furthermore, if equivalent measures, particularly in terms of financial regulation, are not adopted by the US, the EU will find itself at a competitive disadvantage, which will be extremely harmful to the European economy."
"I therefore reiterate the need to protect the EU's interests by means of a coherent and coordinated policy between the EU and the US in the various areas of common interest."
"I voted against the resolution on the upcoming Transatlantic United States-European Union Summit because, in spite of the great hopes raised by his arrival at the White House and his historic election in a country where ethnic minorities still face discrimination, President Obama has, until now, only made symbolic gestures."
"The current president of the United States shares the same economic model of non-intervention in economic matters as the previous administration, has continued the same military policy as his predecessor (he sent more troops into Afghanistan and is setting up new military bases in Colombia), he has yet to close the Guantánamo camp or lift the embargo on Cuba."
"He has placed no pressure on Israel or Morocco to comply with international legislation."
"To this day, the United States continues to impose the death penalty in 38 federal states."
"It has yet to ratify the Ottawa Treaty on the control of the weapons trade or the Kyoto Protocol."
"For these reasons, I have voted against this resolution."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I attach great importance to the European Union-United States Summit to be held in early November 2009."
"During the recent G20 meeting, many promises were made that will be hard to keep if countries act on their own authority."
"In this regard, the EU and the United States should assume a leading role in the implementation of the commitments made by the G20."
"Consequently, we need more effective coordination between the measures taken by the United States and the EU."
"That is why I encourage these joint meetings between Europeans and Americans and, more specifically, the discussions at Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) level."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Guinea"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guinea."
"Mr President, I believe that the level of interest in this matter far outweighs the crowd of people that have hurried into this Chamber this afternoon, which I regret once again for my group and for the others."
"Mr President, Guinea-Conakry needs the support of the international community."
"Following the death of President Conté, a military junta seized power."
"Criticised by the international community, it did, however, receive domestic support because it promised a rapid transition to a civil regime with free elections."
"Captain Dadis Camara, who led the junta, made a firm commitment not to stand in the presidential elections, but after a disastrous management of the country - no budget, no public tender bids, no basic services for the population - he acquired a taste for power and clung to it so tightly that he is now standing in the elections."
"His electoral campaign relies on all of the country's organisational, media and economic resources."
"In the face of this violation of the commitments formerly made by the junta, the opposition organised a demonstration, which was brutally repressed by the presidential guard."
"It left 150 dead and more than 1 000 injured, and many women were raped and disembowelled."
"The reaction of the European Parliament and, I hope, of the European Union, will be clear."
"We call for the suspension of the European Union fisheries agreement."
"We call on the African Union to impose sanctions on the military junta and to organise a dialogue within a reconciliation committee."
"We call for the installation of a transitional government to prepare for the presidential and legislative elections, the junta being definitively outlawed by the international community."
"I hope that these reactions, which are appropriate for the tragedy that has taken place, will set a precedent, and that in other cases of flagrant breaches of human rights, the European Union will have the courage to act just as promptly."
"author. - Mr President, when you look into the situation of Guinea and learn about the atrocities that have taken place there in recent months, the first legitimate question to ask is why it has had so little media coverage."
"There have been only a few lines here and there, as though there had not been hundreds of people killed, terrible acts of torture and horrifying acts of rape aimed at annihilating human dignity."
"It is true that various international institutions have condemned the military junta that came to power after a coup d'état, but I believe that much more should have been done to raise awareness among ordinary citizens, including European citizens."
"This is why I am pleased that at least the European Parliament, speaking on behalf of the citizens who sent us here, has an appropriate reaction and the resolution we will vote on today appropriately addresses it."
"However, I consider that what is of the utmost importance is not only to criticise and condemn the current regime but also to eliminate any possibility of European funds intended to help the people of Guinea being misappropriated."
"28 September is an important date for the people of Guinea because it is the day when the referendum on independence took place."
"From this year on, however, 28 September will be a day marking the massacre perpetrated against opponents by the government installed by violence in Conakry."
"Keeping this military junta in power is not an acceptable option."
"In fact, during all this time, Captain Dadis Camara, who assumed power, has promised that he will drop out of the contest and not present himself as a candidate."
"The date for this has now expired and soon, the ultimatum given by the African Union will too."
"It is obvious that now that the military are in power, they are lying and must not be taken at their word."
"This is why a democratic government is needed, based on elections, and the international community must exert pressure to this end."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I already spoke in the debate during the Brussels mini-session, two weeks ago."
"Therefore I shall not go back over my speech."
"My fellow Members have already made a number of points."
"For my part, I should like to say how pleased I am that all of the political groups within Parliament can today jointly respond to the appeal launched by Guinean civil society, by condemning the repression carried out by the military junta that has been in power since December, a repression of the peaceful demonstration staged to mark Guinea's independence."
"This Guinean civil society is asking us to come to its aid, and it would, in fact, be totally unacceptable for the European Union to release funds as part of the fisheries agreement that we know full well today will go straight into the pockets of the military junta in power and not be used to help Guinean fishermen, as the texts intend."
"The Guinean regime is the most corrupt regime in the world today."
"It is not I who says so, but the bodies in charge of monitoring the situation."
"I therefore sincerely hope that, together, we will be able to vote for the joint resolution in its entirety, including the paragraph calling for the suspension of the fisheries agreement, and I hope that we will have the support of the Council and the Commission on this matter."
"Mr President, when, at the end of last year, Captain Camara headed the military junta which took power in Guinea after the death of President Conté, the international community unfortunately held the naïve belief that Captain Camara would hold free and democratic presidential elections in which he would not take part."
"We now know that when, on 28 September, over 50 000 opposition supporters gathered in the national stadium to protest against Captain Camara's change of tack and broken promises, he sent the troops against them."
"Over 150 people died, over 1 200 were wounded, and there were numerous cases of rape."
"I am pleased that Javier Solana, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security, was so quick to speak out."
"I would like to thank the French Government for suspending military cooperation with Guinea."
"However, three weeks have passed since the massacre, and these actions have yielded no visible results."
"For this reason, I believe that the European Union should focus on exerting pressure on Guinea, together with the UN and the African Union, and to apply the severest possible sanctions."
"Only then will we be able to talk about the handover of power by Captain Camara."
"Mr President, I welcome the decision announced by the Commissioner for Fisheries, Joe Borg, a couple of days ago that the Commission is withdrawing its proposal for a fisheries agreement with Guinea."
"The Committee on Fisheries has already voted against such an agreement."
"We did this two days after the massacre in Conakry, when more than 150 people were shot dead by government troops controlled by Moussa Camara."
"I hope that this is the first step towards the European Union reviewing its trade policy with developing countries."
"We have a huge responsibility as one of the world's most important and largest players when it comes to trade and also development."
"There must be consistency between our trade and our relationship with this type of regime."
"Over the years, we have tried to improve the fisheries agreement by saying that some of the money from the agreement should go to supporting local fisheries."
"However, the Commission's own evaluations have shown that the money is not actually used for the purpose stated in the agreement, but instead goes directly to support this type of regime."
"The European Union must cease to provide this support."
"Mr President, we already talked about Guinea two weeks ago."
"Nevertheless, the situation in the country deserves our continuing attention and response."
"On Monday this week, the Committee on Development heard an eyewitness report of the events of 28 September given by the former prime minister and head of the opposition UFDG party, Mr Diallo."
"It seems to me that calling upon the junta to respect freedom of speech, freedom of assembly or human rights in general will not be enough."
"If the junta respected these principles, these values, it would not be a junta, so we cannot expect that it will listen to these appeals."
"A man of action - and Captain Dadis Camara is definitely one - will only be stopped by action, and not by words."
"That is why I appeal to the European Commission to act."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Guinea is currently being rocked by tragic events that have shocked the international public and flouted the law."
"Indeed, on 28 September 2009, the military junta led by Captain Dadis Camara carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration bringing together all of the opposition parties."
"Now, the Cotonou agreements base relations between the European Union and its ACP partners on respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"Therefore, Captain Dadis Camara's unilateral decision to postpone the elections and to refuse to raise the issue of his candidacy for Guinean president is a serious failure to honour the commitments made to hold free and transparent elections within one year."
"The European Union must therefore take immediate action in line with the principles and the permanent values that underpin its action so that this violence, which represents so many human rights violations, stops."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the compromise resolution is fully in line with our values and principles, but I am particularly anxious to emphasise here Article 10 of this text, namely the suspension of the fisheries agreement protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea until the democratic process has begun."
"I can hear people wondering whether such a decision would have disastrous socio-economic consequences for the population but, faced with the violence of 28 September, we must recognise that the Guinean Government is scarcely concerned about the living conditions of its citizens and that it leaves us with no other option than to be firm."
"Since its independence in 1958, Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes."
"Mr President, I will not repeat all of the intelligent and sensible things that have already been said by my fellow Members."
"I would firstly like to say that I am very pleased that this issue is being debated here today."
"I will briefly say a few words about the debate we had in the committee about the fisheries agreement on 30 September."
"In fact, when we debated this issue, you would have thought that the EU was in the process of entering into a trade agreement with any old Western democracy."
"Nowhere in the discussion or in the documents was it mentioned that the agreement in front of us was with a nation in which the situation is as it is today and which has already been described very well in this House."
"Many people perhaps thought that fisheries and human rights are completely separate issues and that we should not mix the two together."
"Personally, I cannot understand how, as a politician, anyone could think in that way."
"The fact that the votes in the committee were 11 to 9 in favour of not concluding the agreement is also very worrying."
"This means that there was quite a large group in Parliament that, at least at that stage, thought that it was perfectly alright to enter into a trade agreement with a country like Guinea with the sort of regime that it has."
"I am pleased to say, firstly, that there is now a much higher level of agreement for us taking a clear line with regard to Guinea and, secondly, that there is broad support for the Council actually having withdrawn this agreement now."
"I am extremely pleased about this."
"Some people may well think that those in favour of the agreement being withdrawn are not thinking about the fishermen who will be affected, but that is by no means the case."
"Of course, we must find a sustainable solution for them, but we cannot sweep human rights under the carpet simply because we have a number of fishing boats that need to be provided for."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group."
"Mr President, I had the honour of participating in the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries when it voted, albeit by a very narrow margin, against renewing the fishing agreement with Guinea, precisely because of the massacres, rapes, and all the human rights violations which have taken place and have yet to be investigated."
"Today, I would like the European Parliament to adopt this resolution in plenary."
"This step would send a clear message, both to the European institutions and to the government of Guinea, that we are not prepared to contribute taxpayers' money to keep a corrupt government in power that is involved in criminal activities."
"I would be happy if, for once, and I hope that this will set a precedent, human lives and human rights were viewed as more important than an economic agreement."
"Such a move would please me all the more because the Commission has already taken that step, as has the Committee on Fisheries."
"It is now high time that the European Parliament also ratified this decision during its plenary session."
"Thus, this is a great opportunity for us and I hope, as has already been mentioned, that article ten will remain intact."
"(Applause from certain quarters)"
"Mr President, at least 157 dead and over 1 200 wounded is the result of the Guinean army's intervention in a peaceful opposition demonstration at the stadium in Conakry in September."
"This is the biggest massacre since Guinea's independence in 1958."
"In taking power in December last year, President Camara promised to tackle corruption and anarchy and then to hand over power in democratic elections."
"Today, the military junta continues to rule the country with no respect for the basic principles of the rule of law or fundamental rights."
"Gangs of soldiers are regularly involved in attacks, robbery and rape."
"As representatives of democratic countries, we must demand the immediate withdrawal of the junta and that all responsible for the bloody massacre of civilians, shooting into crowds and the public raping of women be brought to justice."
"Guinea is a country with huge economic potential, yet in spite of this, it is one of the world's poorest countries and one of the most corrupt states in Africa, and further dictatorship by the military junta could lead to civil war and destabilise the situation in the whole of West Africa."
"(FR) Mr President, 150 deaths and countless instances of sexual degradation have been recorded today."
"It was an unprecedented violation of the Guinean civilian population that was carried out on 28 September."
"It was also a disproportionate repression by the military junta in power, and the witness accounts leave no room for doubt."
"We must be extremely firm in the face of such barbarity, and I welcome the targeted sanctions against Captain Moussa Dadis Camara's junta that were decided on yesterday by the EU Member States."
"Condemning the events is clearly not enough."
"We must demand that the events be investigated in full by a genuine international commission of inquiry, and that the crimes that have been committed do not go unpunished."
"Moreover, I myself, would like, in the 30 seconds that I have left, to call on the Union to use all the means in its power to combat the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war."
"This is a fast-growing phenomenon in many armed conflict zones."
"It is women, often the very elderly or the very young, who are the victims."
"In all cases, however, it is vulnerable people who are targeted."
"Support for the rule of law and good governance must automatically be accompanied by respect for human rights, for gender equality and for protection of the most vulnerable, as minimum conditions for any type of new cooperation agreement."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 September, the people of Guinea took to the streets to appeal for the commitments that had been made to be honoured, and for free and democratic elections to be held, as promised."
"They have suffered the worst possible repression by a regime that was already devoid of all legitimacy and which, that day, lost all dignity."
"Men were repressed, women were disembowelled with bayonets, and raped, and the political opponents and trade unionists were tortured and maimed."
"The European Union must today support the African Union, ECOWAS and the United Nations in refusing to allow this crime to go unpunished and, above all, in showing solidarity towards the Guinean population."
"This country, which has an abundance of assets, will never be able to use them for its development as long as corrupt dictatorships can seize them for the benefit of a clan."
"That is why I welcome the firm approach announced by the European Commission, one which our Parliament is able to demonstrate today."
"We cannot weigh strict economic interests against the commitments that were made by the European Union's partners, particularly those who signed the Cotonou Agreement, concerning respect for human rights and respect for democratic principles."
"Today we have a commitment to the people of Guinea: to support them in their fight for freedom and democracy."
"Mr President, I asked for the floor simply to make a comment on the suggestion to suspend the existing EU-Guinea fisheries protocol."
"I doubt whether a brutal regime which does not hesitate to dispense with the lives of 156 of its citizens and is responsible for so many other atrocities will be moved by such a disproportionately small sanction on that issue."
"We should also bear in mind that there are legal obligations regarding this agreement towards people employed in the fishing industry in Guinea who have nothing to do with the brutal regime."
"That is why the EPP is hesitant to support this suggestion."
"Mr President, the story of Guinea-Conakry follows a depressingly familiar African script: a dictatorial ruler; a military coup; one authoritarian regime replaced by another; and most of the people still living in abject poverty."
"Substantial mineral and oil resources could make Guinea one of Africa's most prosperous nations."
"Instead, the wealth fuels conflict and misery, not only in Guinea, but throughout a region that has witnessed appalling bloodshed and chronic instability in the past 20 years."
"In the past, I have pressed the European Commission to help develop a kind of Kimberley Process for resources other than just diamonds to ensure that the activities of mining companies do not support civil war or ruthless dictators such as Captain Camara in Guinea."
"I am therefore especially concerned about the massive deal struck between Guinea and Chinese companies, and I hope that the Commission and Council will express to Beijing our expectations that its business activities there should neither provoke internal strife nor further undermine human rights in Guinea."
"However, like Mr Kasoulides, I suspect the proposals to rescind the EU fisheries agreement will only serve to punish local communities, not the military junta."
"(FI) Mr President, since we have been praising the Commission here for the decision it has made over the Guinea fisheries protocol, specifically on account of human rights violations, I would like to ask the Commission if it now intends to carry out a systematic survey of other similar situations, or at least prepare to act consistently and just as firmly if such serious human rights violations occur elsewhere."
"(FI) Mr President, recently a Finnish voter asked me how I would define human rights."
"I said that I should not define them on my own, and that it was not worth doing so; otherwise, they would not get any further than my own front door, the idea being that human rights have already been defined and that countries are committed to a respect for them."
"They are binding on the international community."
"That is why we appeal to them."
"Guinea is a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement, which requires human rights and democracy to be respected."
"This is a basic premise."
"We really must insist that a country's democratic development should get properly under way when we conclude more cooperation agreements on the basis of Cotonou."
"As we have heard, the situation in Guinea at this time is intolerable and calls for a swift response and possible sanctions."
"Guinea has important reserves of ore and, consequently, great opportunities for development."
"At the same time, it is one of the world's most corrupt countries."
"It is quite deplorable that Chinese state-owned companies and businesses that invest in Guinea do not insist on any sort of commitment to human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The main objective of the new partnership agreement between the EU and Guinea-Conakry is to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea so as to encourage the establishment of a partnership to develop a policy of sustainable fishing and responsible exploitation of fisheries resources in the Guinea fishing zone, in the interests of both parties."
"The financial contribution under the protocol is set at EUR 450 000 per year, for fishing opportunities relating to the category of highly migratory species."
"The entire amount is intended for establishing a national fisheries policy based on responsible fishing and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources in Guinean waters."
"The above is in line with the Portuguese Communist Party's proposal regarding fishing agreements with third countries, which is why I voted in favour of this document."
"2."
"Iran"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Iran."
"Mr President, Iran is characterised by linguistic, religious, ethnic and political diversity."
"The Shia majority lives alongside Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Christians, Jews and Baha'i."
"The Persian majority shares the country with countless ethnic minorities that make up almost half of the population: Azeris, Arabs, Kurds, Baloch and others."
"The cities are teeming with a modern middle class and young people ready to live in 21st century Iran."
"All this commotion and complexity frightens the regime that would rather have a simple Iran: simple in terms of religious fanaticism, in isolation of the country and simple in terms of public opinion cowed by violent repression."
"This resolution describes the systematic violation of human rights to which Iranians are subjected in their own country, including frequent application of the death penalty, even against children, the stoning of men and women, extensive limitations on freedom of expression and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities."
"With this resolution, Parliament is sending out two separate messages."
"The first is for the people of Iran: Europe sees in Iranians and, particularly in its young people, the hope for a future in which their country will embrace democracy and freedom and will take on an important role in the region, as it deserves."
"The second is for the Iranian regime: we are telling it that Iran will never fulfil its unquestionable potential as long as violence and obscurantism are the main features of a political regime that merely pays lip service to the values of justice and peace and continues to brutally oppress its people."
"author. - Mr President, any government derives its legitimacy from providing for the well-being of its own citizens."
"Any regime that fails at this most basic responsibility loses its legitimacy in the international community."
"Current self-isolation is leading to destruction in Iran and has a toxic impact on neighbouring countries and on the rest of the world."
"We cannot stand by and watch minor offenders being hanged, people being raped and arbitrary violence wrought upon citizens by their own regime."
"We stand here to restate that there cannot and will not be impunity for those guilty of committing crimes against humanity, and we will continue to stand with the Iranian people as they exercise their right to free speech and peaceful protest for freedom and democracy."
"The European Union has a responsibility in keeping these universal rights on the agenda, including when trade interests or the nuclear programme of Iran are at issue."
"Only when the Iranian regime earns its legitimacy from its citizens can it be a credible player in the international community."
"author. - Mr President, this situation is rooted in a very special clerical dictatorship, which is notorious for its indiscriminate suppression of human rights and civil liberties."
"The situation has even worsened since the June elections."
"Arrests, torture and executions of minors and women have increased."
"In fact, Iran has the highest number of executions in the world after China."
"The latest information, which is not reflected in the draft resolution, is that yesterday, Iran's regime hanged five prisoners in Tehran's Evin prison, including Soheila Ghadiri, a 28-year-old woman."
"She is the fourth woman to be hanged by the regime in the past month."
"Such barbaric sentences have nothing to do with crimes allegedly committed by the prisoners but are rather an effort to intensify the atmosphere of terror in the country, especially among women and young people, who have displayed their resolve to establish democracy and oppose the elections."
"Regardless of how many people are here in this House, when we speak in Parliament, we are also speaking for the millions of people in Iran who have gone out on the streets and have risked their lives and safety to protest against elections that they believed to be fraudulent."
"These millions of Iranians, inside and outside the country, expect something from us and, therefore, the starting point cannot be anything other than that of solidarity and of collaboration in aiding these millions of Iranians, who are fighting for democracy and for human rights and who, it should be pointed out, are running risks much greater than those normally feared by diplomacy."
"I would say, then, that the starting point cannot be anything else."
"It is true that Western policy has very often been a simplistic policy that is ignorant with regard to Iran."
"It is true that Europe has too often been reactive with policies that proved to be wrong with regard to Iran."
"It is true that very often we have not wanted to accept that Iran should have the respect from the international community that, as a major regional power, it certainly craves."
"As put by an Iranian artist in exile after the protests, the West did not want the Islamic Republic and now we do not even have a republic."
"However, none of this can excuse a regime that has repressed freedom, an oppressive regime and, now, a regime based on the increasingly flimsy foundations of fraudulent elections and oppression of its people."
"The Iranian people expect solidarity and support from Parliament, and we seek to provide it with this text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know about the political and social conditions in which the citizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran live."
"We are aware of religion's significant interference in political decisions and the sphere of fundamental human rights."
"The latest example was the killing of Behnood Shojaee, a young man recently executed even though he was a minor at the time of the crime."
"This is the latest episode in a chain of serious violations of human rights which have entailed the repression of political opponents, homosexuals, journalists, intellectuals and anyone who is fighting for the social and civil development of Iran."
"The situation has deteriorated during the regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who began his presidency by repeatedly denying the Holocaust and the State of Israel's right to exist."
"Since 2005, the number of executions in Iran has quadrupled, and Iran is the only country in the world which executes minors guilty of crimes."
"The systematic use of torture in prisons and the use of medieval punishments, such as amputation and stoning, is well known, but the regime is in difficulty as shown by the tens of thousands of people who were brave enough to protest in the streets following the last elections."
"The young woman, Neda Agha-Soltan, killed in the street as she was standing up for her rights as a woman and as a citizen, has become the symbol not only of the repression, but also of the desire for freedom of a people that Europe must help."
"How can we help?"
"One way is with the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Another tangible proposal is to name streets or squares in our cities after Neda Agha-Soltan."
"This would not only commemorate her sacrifice, but would show our solidarity with Iranian opposition and provide greater information and awareness of such a serious situation among European citizens."
"I would like to see a picture of Neda Agha-Soltan next to the picture of Aung San Suu Kyi displayed on one side of the European Parliament building in Brussels."
"One final comment: how can President Ahmadinejad have any credibility in the negotiations on the nuclear issue when he is persecuting and going against his own people who are calling for greater democracy, greater freedom and greater respect for human rights?"
"author. - Mr President, while we sit in this Chamber having grand debates, the hangmen in Iran are working overtime."
"As we heard from Tunne Kelam, yesterday they hanged another five people, including a young woman, the parents of whose victim had pardoned her."
"So she had actually been excused the death penalty but was subsequently hanged."
"But we follow a policy of appeasement in the EU."
"Only this week, we have agreed that we will encourage the Russians to enrich the nuclear fuel rods, on behalf of Ahmadinejad, in return for his guarantee that he will stop his own nuclear enrichment programme."
"But he has not given that guarantee, nor has he given open access for inspectors to look at his nuclear facilities."
"We are only bolstering the Mullahs when we continue this policy of appeasement."
"We need to take tough sanctions."
"Toughness is the only language these Mullahs understand."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this part-session, President Buzek pointed out that the abolition of the death penalty is a basic concern of the European Parliament."
"It applies to all regions of the world that this inhumane and barbaric penalty must be abolished."
"He referred to the executions taking place in Iran."
"Four death sentences in particular are mentioned in the motion for a resolution before us."
"The persons in question have been sentenced to death because they allegedly took part in the protests against the elections, but they were all in custody at the alleged time of the offence."
"So this could still go to appeal and we need to keep an eye on these cases."
"The fact that minors were still being executed in Iran at the time of the offence has also been addressed."
"Iran is the only country which was still executing minors at the time of the offence."
"Iran has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and is therefore obliged to pass a national law prohibiting the execution of minors."
"A bill has been tabled before the Iranian Parliament and we must call on our colleagues there to do everything they can so that the passage of this bill stops being blocked."
"I consider this a very important task."
"To close, I should like to express my high respect for all men and women in Iran who are risking so much, who are taking to the streets, who are engaging in various activities to demand respect for the rights to which they are entitled under the Iranian Constitution."
"Their determination, their commitment and their courage deserve our unreserved solidarity."
"Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute."
"The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution."
"Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason."
"His wife was allowed to leave."
"She rightly stated, and I quote: 'It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God'."
"Iran is bound under international law by its ratification of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates the human right that everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own."
"I find it scandalous that Iran is trampling this right underfoot."
"I am therefore lobbying for the Soltani case to be included in our joint resolution today, in our resolution on Iran, and I ask for your support."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to use this time to express our concern over the situation in Iran and especially of Iranian opposition members in Camp Ashraf in Iraq, which has been the symbol of resistance for people in Iran."
"The Iraqi Government should stop following the orders of the Mullahs in Tehran."
"Iraq should understand that the Iranian regime has no future and is holding on to power for repression and executions."
"So, if Iraq is a sovereign country, they should respect and implement the European Parliament resolution of 24 April 2009 on Ashraf, which calls on Iraq to stop any forcible displacement of Ashraf residents within Iraq."
"The Mullahs in Tehran want Ashraf to be destroyed, and we in Europe must support these defenceless Iranian refugees."
"It is our moral duty."
"We should ask the EU Presidency and the Commission to ask the UN to become more involved by sending a permanent team - and even a peacekeeping force - there to prevent more attacks and prevent these people being moved by force to other parts of Iraq."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran has deteriorated sharply in recent months."
"An apt illustration of this is the current developments in the repressive apparatus provided by President Ahmadinejad to nip in the bud even the appearance of any kind of opposition to his administration, which is of dubious legitimacy."
"The notorious thugs known as the Basij have now been incorporated into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, another sinister organisation."
"What can the European Union still accomplish here?"
"The answer is two things in particular."
"Together with the United States, we, the Western world, must focus on individual cases of serious human rights abuses in Iran (I also refer you to our resolution)."
"In direct conjunction with this, we must make it clear to Tehran that these abuses are not to be tolerated and will have serious consequences."
"When national interests - particularly of an economic nature - come into play, the Iranian pragmatists will appear of their own accord."
"In doing so, they can even make reference to the late Ayatollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"When it came down to it, he, too, opted resolutely to put the national interest before religious requirements."
"Commission, Council, I urge you to seek out the ayatollahs' weaknesses, primarily in the interests of a more tolerable fabric of life for the Iranian people and in the interests of the security of the Jewish State of Israel, not forgetting the Arab world, and also the European Union."
"(HU) A few days ago, President Barroso was here and I asked him what could be done to resolve the human rights crisis that had been going on in a European Union Member State, Hungary, since autumn 2006."
"I mentioned on several occasions that many hundreds of people were subjected to such heavy-handed police brutality that they suffered serious injuries, while several hundred people were put arbitrarily under arrest and several hundred people went through lengthy criminal proceedings where they were proved innocent."
"The President replied to this that these were internal matters and the European Union cannot interfere in internal matters."
"I would like to ask about the double standard that is being applied and about what legal basis the European Union has for interfering in a country outside the European Union when it is reluctant to protect human rights in a European Union Member State."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to ask our Iranian friends, those belonging to the opposition and even those belonging to the government party, to help Hungarians protect their human rights."
"(FI) Mr President, Iran would have an important role in the Middle East peace negotiations but, to our regret, the country seems to be slipping ever further away from the democratic rule of law."
"Firstly, there is reason to cast serious doubts on the election results last June that allowed President Ahmadinejad to remain in office."
"Since the elections, the general human rights situation has become even worse."
"Furthermore, since Ahmadinejad's rise to power in 2005, the number of executions that have taken place has quadrupled, and Iran executes the most people in the world after China."
"Secondly, freedom of religion and opinion are in a sorry state."
"For example, the seven Baha'i leaders are still imprisoned only on the basis of their religious convictions."
"In our resolution, we are appealing to the Iranian authorities, and I hope that at the same time, we can, in this way, show our support and respect for the courage that many Iranians demonstrate in their fight for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles."
"We have a special respect for those brave Iranian women who had a decisive role to play in the demonstrations following the elections in Tehran."
"(NL) Mr President, Iran is ruled by a strict regime based on a radical interpretation of Islam and of the Koran."
"In Iran, those who want no part in this fall into disfavour."
"Iran is a frightening country, particularly for the Christians there."
"There is literally no life for Muslims who have converted to Christianity in Iran."
"Last year, the Iranian Parliament adopted a law making the abandonment of the Islamic faith a capital offence."
"Nor is there any life in Iran for demonstrators."
"Three people arrested during the demonstrations against the outcome of the presidential election have now been sentenced to death."
"It is utterly wrong and incomprehensible for a court to pronounce such a sentence."
"An appeal against this sentence may still be possible, but it is clear to everyone that even demonstrators must fear for their lives in Iran."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to give these demonstrators strong support in further proceedings and, in particular, to vigorously oppose the brutal Iranian regime."
"(LT) The human rights situation in Iran is clearly deteriorating."
"The presidential elections of dubious legitimacy that took place this year and the mass protests by people following the elections mirrored the increasingly tense and fearful political and social situation in Iran."
"I would like to point out that this year in the Reporters without Borders report evaluating press freedom, Iran ended up at the bottom of the list, that is 172nd out of 175, and was only above Eritrea, North Korea and Turkmenistan."
"The situation for journalists in Iran is one of the worst in the world; free information on the internet is blocked and people writing blogs are persecuted."
"We know only too well the story about the renowned blogger, Fariba Pajooh, who was arrested very recently and whose future remains uncertain."
"I appeal to the European Commission."
"Commissioner, we must establish a Commission delegation in Tehran as soon as possible in order to begin a dialogue with Iran's government institutions on the worsening human rights situation in this country."
"Mr President, I fully agree with the comments of Mr Czarnecki."
"The attack last July on the Iraqi PMOI camp at Ashraf in Iraq can only be described as savage and barbaric."
"Eleven people killed, and a lot more could have been killed; numerous people brutally injured - you have to see the video to realise the barbarity which actually occurred."
"The army and the military indulged themselves in the most sadistic form of brutality."
"As a result, 36 people were arrested; they had no option but to go on hunger strike."
"They were released two weeks ago because of international pressure - and international pressure after 72 days on hunger strike: that is what brought people to heel in relation to the Malaki government."
"So these people are refugees; they are entitled to go to bed at night and get up in the morning, safe."
"We need, as Mr Czarnecki said, two things: first of all, we need a permanent UN presence there to replace the United States and, secondly, an absolute guarantee of no displacement."
"Mr President, I wish to make three small points to add to what my fellow Members have said."
"Firstly - and here I refer to what Mrs Gomes said - in spite of everything that is going on, in spite of the tragedies that are occurring in Iran and the regime, we still have every faith in the political future of that country and in the strength of its civil society."
"My second point is that it has not been emphasised enough that we condemn the latest suicide attacks, which took place in Sistan and Baluchistan, even though the victims were Revolutionary Guards, as well as, sadly, dozens of civilians."
"We are against this type of violence, even though we fully understand the reasons why it takes place but, at this point in time, we must side with the opponents of the regime."
"Lastly, our Parliament, I believe, condemns the death penalty, no matter who it affects - children, women, adults - or which country in the world carries it out."
"I, too, wish to deplore the deterioration in the situation in Iran with regard to human rights, in the wake of the elections in June."
"This deterioration is certainly being signalled by the huge wave of arrests and the violence being shown to the regime's opponents."
"In addition, as has already been mentioned, freedom of information is being put under serious threat, with the risk of persecution being targeted against journalists."
"One major sign of concern is the fact that both torture and the death penalty are being used wholesale in Iran."
"In fact, Amnesty International recently highlighted the fact that, following the elections, the number of people convicted and then executed has multiplied significantly."
"Finally, I wish to show my support for the notion of establishing a European Union delegation in Tehran."
"Such a delegation can work together with civil society on the ground, thereby supporting the rights of the activists campaigning for freedom."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have a proposal to make to you: human rights, democracy and the rule of law are issues that are too important and too urgent to deal with on a Thursday afternoon."
"Unfortunately, there are only a few of us here."
"A month ago, we debated the murder of journalists."
"Today, it is the horrendous human rights situation in Guinea, Iran and Sri Lanka."
"I know that many of you share my opinion."
"Let us find another - a better - date for this important debate."
"Madam, you are supposed to talk on the subject under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"You are using other Members' speaking time."
"The catch-the-eye procedure is closed."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) Let me begin by conveying our condolences to the families of the victims of the terrorist attack carried out in the Sistan-Baluchistan province in Iran."
"The Commission condemns terrorist attacks carried out anywhere in the world, along with the loss of life entailed."
"The European Commission is deeply concerned about the current state of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran."
"When talking about this subject, we can mention examples such as the executions of minors, discrimination against people belonging to different minorities, significant restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, ill treatment of prisoners, denial of the right to a fair trial, as well as large-scale oppression and intimidation of human rights supporters and political opponents."
"The European Union has maintained direct contact with Iran and has openly made its point of view known to the Iranian authorities regarding developments in the country."
"The European Union supports the fundamental freedoms and the universal values they are based on, and feels duty bound to express its view any time and anywhere these principles are flouted."
"Unfortunately, in spite of the numerous appeals and statements of condemnation from the European Union and the international community, the human rights situation has deteriorated even more since the presidential elections that took place in Iran in June 2009."
"Large numbers of people have been executed by hanging in Iran just in the last few weeks."
"One of these people, whom you have already mentioned, Behnoud Shojaee, who was a minor at the time he committed his crime, was executed in spite of repeated appeals from the EU to have his sentence commuted."
"More minors are likely to be executed shortly in Iran."
"We are also concerned about the situation of seven Baha'i leaders in Iran, who have been under arrest for over 17 months and must answer serious accusations, such as espionage and anti-state propaganda."
"The latest scheduled hearing was postponed again on 18 October, leaving these seven people since then without any clear prospect of proper judicial proceedings."
"Hundreds of people were held after the presidential elections because they took part in the post-election demonstrations and made critical comments."
"The trials against those involved in these activities are continuing."
"Indeed, last week, four people were condemned to death because they were involved in post-election incidents."
"I finally wish to emphasise that we share the concerns expressed by honourable Members about the state of human rights in Iran."
"The Commission is monitoring closely how the situation evolves and will continue to use every opportunity to call on the Iranian authorities to observe their international human rights commitments, including compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Improving the human rights situation in Iran is a key element in the European Commission's approach to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation with Tehran in the future."
"In answer to the question I was asked, we believe that at the moment, given the current conditions in Iran, it is not the right time to establish a European Commission Delegation in Tehran."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I call upon the European Union not to stand by passively while human rights are being violated in Iran."
"The European Union has to take a much more resolute stance against the death sentences passed in the country and the executions, and especially those imposed on young and under-age criminals."
"Reacting to what is happening in Iran today is one of the greatest tests of the effectiveness of our western world."
"For this reason, the European Commission must set up a delegation of the European Union in Tehran as soon as possible to support and reinforce dialogue with Iranian leaders and civil society, especially to give support to young people, political prisoners and journalists."
"The European Commission must become much more involved in the sending of a special envoy by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor the situation as regards political prisoners and to ensure that the Iranian authorities observe international procedural standards and legal obligations with regard to human rights."
"The European Union will always be a standard-bearer for civil freedoms and our common European democratic values, even beyond our borders."
"For that reason, we should make all efforts, through intensive dialogue with the political elites, so that Iran in the 21st century observes fundamental human rights and respects the right to life."
"3."
"Sri Lanka"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka."
"author. - Mr President, the people of Sri Lanka - Sinhalese and particularly the Tamils - have suffered enormously over these past 30 years from a ruthless terrorist campaign conducted by the LTTE."
"Now that the LTTE have been defeated in the field, the Government and people of Sri Lanka need our sympathetic understanding and, above all, our assistance as they try to set their country once more on the path of recovery and prosperity and prevent any resurgence of terrorism."
"There are those, including LTTE apologists, who want to deliver a further blow to the Sri Lankan people by undermining the GSP+ preferential trade arrangements with the EU."
"I hope the Commission understands that it is trade, not aid, that offers the best route to economic recovery."
"For its part, the Sri Lankan authorities need to address the concerns expressed by friends in the international community so there is no excuse for GSP+ status to be compromised."
"The immediate priority, of course, is to resettle those thousands of Tamil civilians caught up in the conflict and now being held in poor conditions in camps."
"Their processing needs to take place with all urgency, and the international community should be invited to help."
"author. - Mr President, I support this resolution even though I think it is not critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government."
"Earlier this year, we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers, without any regard for the lives or well-being of citizens who, in my view, are used as pawns by all sides, resulting in 90 000 dead."
"The world stood horrified and helpless, yet still today, there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens who are interned without adequate medical facilities, without clean water, sanitation or living space."
"Today's resolution is a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citizens."
"It is my own view that, if there is no measurable progress soon on the demands in this resolution, then the European Union must bring economic and political pressure to bear on the regime in Sri Lanka."
"Sri Lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support."
"We must use that leverage in the interests of the Sri Lankan peoples, including the Tamil people."
"Mr President, I have two minutes."
"The 25-year civil war in Sri Lanka appears to be over."
"In May, government troops captured the areas in the north held by the LTTE."
"Hopefully, a new beginning will bring peace and, with it, freedom."
"The people are suffering not only from the effects of the civil war, but also from the consequences of the tsunami and other natural disasters."
"The EU has stepped up foreign trade and is granting higher tariff preferences than to any other country in southeast Asia."
"International aid brings with it the obligation for the political forces in Sri Lanka to implement human rights."
"Two hundred and fifty thousand people are being held in overcrowded camps with poor drinking water and medical supplies."
"The aid organisations are being refused access."
"It should be in the government's own interest to organise the return to home villages as quickly as possible."
"The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is lobbying for the International Red Cross to be given a key role."
"Another sector in which change is needed is freedom of the press and freedom of expression."
"The abduction and arrest of journalists must end."
"Critical articles should stop being punished with prison sentences."
"As a member of the SAARC delegation, I have been able to visit Sri Lanka many times."
"I believe a new beginning for this country will be rich in opportunity if the Tamil leaders are included in a constructive manner."
"However, this means rejecting all forms of terrorism and violence and it means cooperation on a strategy to implement human rights."
"I wish, for the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka, that an expression which I have heard time and again - 'war is an institution' - will finally be consigned to the past."
"(Applause)"
"author. - Mr President, the policy pursued towards the Tamil people by the Government of President Rajapaksa has resulted in a nightmare for both the Sinhala and Tamil peoples in Sri Lanka, with massive repression by the Sri Lankan state against individuals and groups who have stood up against its chauvinist policies."
"After the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, the nightmare continues for the Tamil people, especially in the north of Sri Lanka, with 300 000 people - including 31 000 children - forcefully detained in camps where disease and malnutrition are rife."
"Now a new horror threatens, with reports that the Rajapaksa Government plans to settle Sinhala people in the east and north of Sri Lanka - in other words, to colonise the areas where Tamil-speaking people are in the majority."
"That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future."
"The Rajapaksa Government is, in fact, a dictatorship with a very thin democratic veneer."
"I welcome the opportunity through this resolution to condemn it."
"I do have a reservation about paragraph 4 because the main terrorism, in fact, has come from the Rajapaksa Government against the people."
"While, as a Socialist, I believe that guerrillaism under the conditions in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution, the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military repression."
"The best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies, and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society, under which the marvellous resources of that country could be used for the benefit of the entire population."
"I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka, which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland, and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self-determination."
"Mr President, everything that my colleagues here testified to concerning the current situation in Sri Lanka was confirmed when the Subcommittee on Human Rights recently organised a hearing on this nightmarish situation."
"We can actually confirm that the movements of these 260 000 Tamils are still being restricted, contrary to all international laws, even though it has been months now since the war itself ended."
"We can confirm that there are serious restrictions on the freedom of the press."
"Yesterday, Reporters Without Frontiers ranked Sri Lanka number 162 on the Press Freedom Index out of 175 countries."
"We must now demand that the representatives of all the delegated UN bodies be allowed into these camps."
"The resolution mentions the organisation of local elections and we, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, are saying something rather less forceful, and I hope that people will support it."
"We would just like to record that these elections are being organised."
"As regards the question of policy on trade, I am very glad that the Commission is now examining how Sri Lanka is implementing the requirements of the various human rights agreements."
"I expect the Commission to work very objectively and impartially and, in time, to draw conclusions as to whether Sri Lanka has actually deserved this preferential treatment under GSP+."
"Mr President, victors should be generous and I think that, in Sri Lanka, a lot of people have still not understood this."
"The point here is to resolve the cause of ethnic conflict, which has escalated terribly."
"We simply have to realise that there is no plan in place which will guarantee the Tamils their legitimate rights."
"Both sides must move towards each other in order to find a political solution."
"Violence was rightly fought, the perpetrators of violence have been defeated and there is nothing about violence that can be glossed over."
"To abolish the causes of violence, that is the real task."
"It is easier to end a war than to create peace."
"We see that at the moment in Bosnia where, well after the end of the war, a sustainable solution for peace has still not being found."
"I worry about the stability of Sri Lanka, because this minority problem has existed for centuries, exacerbated during the period of colonialism, which is why we must do everything to mediate between both sides and get both sides to come round."
"Mr President, in May this year, after the government's victory over the Tamil Tigers, it appeared that the civil war in Sri Lanka had finally come to an end after many years."
"In reality, however, there are, unfortunately, still many problems that need to be resolved in the country."
"The government is keeping more than 250 000 people in camps on political grounds, not even giving access to humanitarian organisations."
"It represses the media."
"In September this year, the Supreme Court in Colombo sentenced a journalist to 20 years' imprisonment, which the EU Presidency regarded as a threat to freedom of speech and which was roundly condemned."
"One huge obstacle to the country's development are the anti-personnel mines which are a threat to the life and health of people."
"Sri Lanka has still not joined the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines."
"Signing this document would certainly help to resolve this problem and would, at the same time, allow the country to apply for assistance for the victims of landmines and speed up the mine removal campaign, which has been operating since 2003 with little effect."
"The citizens of Sri Lanka deserve true democracy and a decent life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for months now, the Sri Lankan Government has maintained a wall of silence regarding the situation of the Tamil civilian population, preventing foreign media and humanitarian organisations from gaining access to them."
"Since March 2009, Colombo has been holding almost all of the civilians who fled the fighting between the army and the Tamil Tigers, in complete violation of international law and human rights."
"In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island."
"The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases."
"In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery."
"The living conditions are appalling."
"President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released."
"In view of the scale of the tragedy, the European Union must step up the pressure on the Sri Lankan Government in order to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of all the civilians, access to the camps for journalists and the prompt delivery of humanitarian aid."
"Mr President, as a representative of London, a city that has repeatedly been a target for terrorists in the past 40 years, I have a great deal of sympathy with Sri Lankans of all ethnicities."
"The relentless terrorist campaign waged by the Tamil Tigers severely blighted the development of that beautiful country."
"President Rajapaksa came to power democratically, determined to defeat the LTTE, and his success should be congratulated by all of us who despise terrorism."
"The government now has the responsibility of building a post-conflict society with liberty, justice and equality for all Sri Lankans."
"Returning the IDPs home and trying the war criminals must now be the government's priority."
"While I concede that President Rajapaksa may have lost some international goodwill through some of his emergency actions in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I am convinced that the best way forward is to guarantee the development of a secure and prosperous Sri Lanka and support its democratically-elected leader and government."
"The EU must maintain the GSP+ trade agreements which, if removed, will directly destroy one million jobs and indirectly economically impact on 2.5 million innocent Sri Lankan citizens."
"Mr President, I am very pleased as an Irish MEP that my colleagues from Ireland, Joe Higgins and Proinsias De Rossa, have outlined various concerns in Sri Lanka and Iran, and I concur with them."
"It is appropriate that Ireland should be concerned about these issues because it saw discrimination and loss of life in Northern Ireland for many years."
"Nevertheless, at the end of the day, the only solution comes through diplomacy and discussion."
"For that reason, I would hope that when the Lisbon Treaty is enacted, the new powers and the status which the President and the High Representative have will be utilised to bring, hopefully, common sense and good understanding to these places so that they will mend their ways and commit to the diplomatic and democratic way of life."
"(FI) Mr President, we have followed and commented on the situation in Sri Lanka on a number of occasions and sometimes almost abandoned hope of finding a solution."
"Nevertheless, the conflict, which lasted 25 years, ended in the defeat of the Tamil Tigers this year."
"The lengthy conflict typically claimed a lot of victims and gave rise to internal refugees in the country, as well as causing problems for the economy and developments in the rule of law."
"Now the country has entered a hopeful, though critical, phase."
"There has been mention here of the concern over the plight of those who have been living in the camps."
"As we state in the resolution, we hope that the authorities will soon accept international assistance and open the camps to receive humanitarian aid and trained conflict personnel."
"At the same time, we also need the commitment of the international community to get down to business and build a lasting peace for that lovely island."
"Aid should also definitely extend to additional sums allocated by the Commission for mine clearance."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to take the floor, first of all, in order to highlight what my colleague, Mrs Hautala, has said."
"We need to bear in mind the role which not only the Red Cross, but also the United Nations, plays - and ought to play - in this process."
"However, I also wanted to respond to what Mr Van Orden has said, as it seems to me to be wholly inappropriate to label those of us who try to use a straightforward instrument, such as the GSP+ trade agreements, as sympathisers or supporters of the LTTE."
"This is simply not true."
"We know that there is an ongoing investigation to determine whether the Sri Lankan authorities are doing their part to incorporate human rights legislation into national legislation."
"If this is not being done properly, then it is quite normal and necessary for us to call for the GSP+ system not to be extended."
"Therefore, it seems to me that relating this extension, this petition or this request, to support for the LTTE is quite wrong"
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the vote."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"
"1."
"Guinea (vote)"
"2."
"Iran (vote)"
"3."
"Sri Lanka (vote)"
"Mr President, I suggest that we remove recital 3 from the resolution, because the situation of the journalist Ti Sei Nayagam is only mentioned at the beginning and not in the operative part of the resolution."
"We removed this item from our agenda during our joint negotiations."
"I therefore recommend that this issue should be deleted here."
"We shall certainly have an opportunity to discuss this issue again another time."
"Voting time"
"Thank you, Commissioner Orban."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debate."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say something about a point which arose during the explanations of vote this afternoon and now too during the catch-the-eye procedure."
"Under the rules of procedure, no further requests are accepted once explanations of vote or the catch-the-eye procedure have begun."
"I had asked the services to perhaps make this generally known once again."
"We dealt with this casually today, but we need to take care in future, because otherwise we shall go well over the time announced to Members."
"The next item is the vote on six motions for resolutions on Guinea."
"We shall look first at the joint motion for a resolution from six groups, which is intended to replace all the motions for resolutions on this issue."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Composition of committees: see Minutes"
"(DE) Mr President, my apologies but, throughout the course of the day, I have listened to a right-wing Hungarian extremist speak about Hungary under every item."
"Please could you point out that we have an agenda with separate items."
"Perhaps the Member is unaware of that."
"(Applause)"
"Unfortunately, the Member is not present."
"I assume that she will take note of your comment."
"Decisions concerning certain documents: see Minutes"
"Written declarations included in the register (Rule 123): see Minutes"
"Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting: see Minutes"
"Dates of forthcoming sittings: see Minutes"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 16.35)"
"Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of the democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe"
"Before we begin, I should like to say that I have exchanged views with President Havel, and I can assure you that we could not have imagined something like this 25 years ago!"
"(Applause)"
"former President of the Czech Republic. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to address you during the days marking the twentieth anniversary of the dramatic breaching of the sealed borders, the cutting of the barbed wire and the tearing down of the walls between European nations and, in the case of Germany, the wall that divided one and the same nation."
"It was the end of the bipolar division, not only of Europe but, to a considerable extent, of the whole world."
"It was a moment of such historical importance that many people felt that from then onwards, the world could only prosper."
"It did not happen."
"History, of course, did not end."
"It is all the more important to embrace this anniversary not only as an appeal to reflect on the present but, first and foremost, as an appeal to think about the future."
"I would like to contribute to this appeal with five comments on the theme of European unification."
"None of us were fully prepared for the surprisingly rapid fall of the Iron Curtain, nor could we have been."
"It would have been unnatural."
"A period of specific dilemmas, examinations of various alternatives and uncertainty therefore followed."
"Finally, NATO took the courageous step of allowing in new members, thereby guaranteeing their security and enabling them to concentrate on preparing for accession to the European Union."
"After that, the Union genuinely opened its doors to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe."
"From time to time, there are various difficulties with these countries."
"That is quite understandable."
"A democratic political culture cannot be created or revived on a day to day basis."
"It takes time and there are a host of unexpected problems that need resolving along the way."
"It was in the modern historical period that Communism held sway for the first and hopefully last time, and we were therefore the first to encounter the phenomenon of post-communism."
"We had to deal with the consequences of a protracted regime of fear and all the risks connected with a historically unprecedented redistribution of assets."
"There have been, and there still are, many obstacles and our experience with this state of affairs is still in its infancy."
"Nonetheless, I believe that the West did the right thing."
"Every other alternative would have entailed many more problems and would have been even more costly, not only for the West but, in fact, for all of us."
"Not only might we have seen the dangerous development of a new struggle over spheres of influence or the direct domination of one side by another, but also the states locked out by the West would, in all likelihood, have become a playground for various nationalists and populists and their armed militias and possibly even a region of dangerous local conflicts, all the more dangerous for the fact that, for reasons that are well-known, the Second World War was not followed by a genuine peace conference that might have established European post-war relations in a binding, exact and lasting manner."
"In my opinion, many of those that waved flags bearing the hammer and sickle until recently would be very quick to take up a national flag."
"We saw what that leads to in the former Yugoslavia."
"It is a well known fact, of course, that demons always awaken further demons."
"No one can say, therefore, whether the contagion would have jumped across to the western part of Europe."
"We are living in an era when - thanks to globalisation - any local conflict can easily grow into a world conflict."
"The chosen approach was therefore the most natural in historical terms and the most expedient in practical terms."
"It was, moreover, an approach that could be interpreted as an expression of shared responsibility for historical developments, the beginnings of which lay partly in the short-sighted policy of appeasement pursued by the democratic world."
"I would like to summarise by saying that the considerable difficulties the EU has with us today are worth shouldering because any of the alternative courses of action would clearly have been much worse and much more dangerous."
"In these circumstances, all that we can ask from Europe is patience and understanding."
"What we can offer to Europe is the question, of course."
"I have long believed, after what we endured in the era of totalitarianism, that we should have - for we are directly guilty - explained the experience convincingly to others, transforming everything that emerged from it into concrete initiatives."
"That is no easy matter and I am not sure we have achieved it yet."
"Totalitarian or authoritarian forms of government often have very unobtrusive beginnings and very refined methods of social control."
"Only now, with the passage of time, do many of us realise how cleverly we were sometimes drawn into the webs of totalitarianism."
"All of this makes us particularly wary."
"That should be our contribution towards a guarantee that what we experienced can never happen again."
"What is required?"
"First and foremost, clear and explicit solidarity with everyone who is confronting totalitarian or authoritarian regimes today, wherever they are in the world."
"The solidarity in question should not be impeded by any economic or other special interests."
"Even small, inconspicuous and well-intentioned compromises can - albeit indirectly and with some delay - lead to fateful consequences."
"Evil cannot be appeased, as it is in the nature of evil to exploit every appeasement for its own ends."
"Besides, Europe has its own unhappy experience of political appeasement."
"Our support can be of more help than we might imagine to liberal-minded people or outspoken witnesses of the conditions in North Korea, Burma, Iran, Tibet, Belarus, Cuba or wherever else."
"We will also be helping ourselves."
"We will be helping ourselves to build a better world and to treat each other in a better way, in other words, to be truer to the actual content of the values we subscribe to at a communal level."
"The European Parliament recently awarded the Sakharov Prize to Memorial, a Russian organisation monitoring respect for human rights in Russia."
"I believe this was an important act."
"I remember the significance it had in my own country when, against the wishes of the government, the French President once invited us - the opposition - for a working breakfast during a state visit."
"These things are only seemingly superficial."
"Under totalitarian rule, it is simply a fact that one breakfast or one suppressed student demonstration can, in the right circumstances, set history in motion."
"The identity of every human being, except for what is innate to us as unique individuals, is created by the multiple levels of what might be described as our collective identity."
"Every one of us, to a greater or lesser extent, creates his own sense of belonging to family, community, region, firm, church, society or political party, to the nation, to the civilised world and, ultimately, to the population of this planet."
"All of this shows that we have certain types of home, whether geographical, ideological, linguistic, ethnic or otherwise, and we ourselves jointly create these homes."
"Our various kinds of patriotism, our aims, affinities, inclinations, pride, characteristics, traditions, customs, habits, and peculiarities also play a part in this."
"The world, in short, is a patchwork, humanity is a patchwork and each one of us is a patchwork."
"Collective sovereignty naturally arises from this sense of collective belonging."
"We have a certain measure of sovereignty on all of the levels of our identity, but on none of them do we have, or could we have, full sovereignty."
"There is one requirement: for these sovereignties to complement each other and, if possible, not to contradict each other."
"I am sure you have guessed that I am raising this matter now because the debates on the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty largely centre on the question of what sort of relationship there should be between national sovereignty and European sovereignty."
"The answer is clear: they should complement each other."
"If I feel myself to be a European, it does not mean that I cease to be a Czech."
"In fact, the opposite is the case: as a Czech, I am also a European."
"I like to say, somewhat poetically, that Europe is the homeland of our homelands."
"At the same time, I am sure that European sovereignty will gradually strengthen in the future."
"I do not know how quickly or how slowly and I do not know what twists and turns there will be on the way, but I do know that the integration process must continue."
"It is, after all, in the essential and even the existential interest not only of Europeans but of everyone."
"The reasons for this are clear: we are living in the space of a single global civilisation in which the owner of a Greenland fishing company may live in Taiwan and also own part of a bank in Brazil or the owner of a Czech mine may manage his company by computer from Iceland."
"In such a space, various supra-national, supra-state or continental communities will play an ever more significant role."
"It is not, nor will it be, the end of the nation state, but nation states are grouping together and they will continue to group together and act together in many areas."
"Technical and economic developments alone make this an absolute necessity."
"On the other hand, at a time when the world is tending towards an ominous form of unification, the constitutions of the various smaller communities of states and nations that are close to each other in one way or another can be instrumental in providing better protection to national or regional identity."
"The gradual and peaceful grouping together of states will also strengthen peaceful coexistence of course."
"Or have most of the wars of the last centuries not been wars of nation states?"
"How better to tame the various nationalist demons than through practical cooperation between nations?"
"Acceding to the principle of multi-layered sovereignty will, of course, only be possible against a background of civilian and political support."
"I have noticed that in my own country - and possibly in many other countries - people often speak in terms of 'us' - in my case the Czechs - and 'them', by which people mean that bunch of wicked foreigners in Brussels."
"Are we not in Brussels too, however?"
"This division into an a priori virtuous 'us' and a somehow wicked 'them' who seek to harm us at any price simply indicates what little understanding there is of the actual principle of integration."
"This, too, has to be patiently confronted."
"We are all in the same boat and the boat is heading in the right direction."
"It will continue heading in the right direction provided that all of the passengers have a sense of shared responsibility and do not just play their own games for their own ends."
"We do not establish importance or uniqueness in a newly-created community by shouting about our vaguely defined national interests, which simply masks a lack of inner confidence, but through purposeful ways of getting along together and participating in the common effort."
"For centuries, Europe has been the main centre of civilisation on this planet and has definitely regarded itself as such, even if it was wrong to do so."
"It therefore felt justified in exporting its culture, its religion and its inventions throughout the world, regardless of whether anyone cared to have them."
"The exporting of these values was often accompanied by violence."
"It might even be said that all of modern civilisation - not just the elements which the world considers outstanding, but also the short-sightedness of today - can be traced back to Europe."
"Europe should learn from all of this and resume its role in a new way."
"That is to say, it will no longer force anything on the world, but will seek only to inspire."
"It will just offer an example, from which others may take something without having to do so."
"It would be difficult to find a region of the Earth in which so many nationalities or ethnic groups were concentrated in various countries, so many minorities and minorities within minorities."
"In recent decades, Europe has nonetheless managed to create what is perhaps the most consistent supra-national grouping to be found anywhere in the world today."
"Most importantly, however, the grouping did not emerge as the product of violence perpetrated against the weak by the strong as was always the case in the past."
"On the contrary, it emerged as the product of practical agreements."
"Integration has therefore relocated from the battlefield to the conference hall."
"If nothing else, this alone can now serve as a major challenge to the rest of the world."
"I mentioned the increasing importance of supra-national structures in today's world."
"In my opinion, the best political arrangement for the forthcoming decades would be a form of creative partnership-based cooperation between these large supra-national or continental entities, based on specific minimum social standards, which should be moral rather than political."
"If they are to make sense, of course, these relationships must be based on two fundamental principles: complete mutual equality and as much openness as possible."
"A relationship is not a partnership when, for practical reasons such as fear of oil or gas supplies being cut, someone fits blinkers to their eyes and forgets all about murders of liberal-minded journalists or similar evils that he would be glad to speak about under other circumstances."
"A relationship such as that is based on falsehood."
"Genuine partners must be able to talk to each other about everything they are thinking, in other words, the whole truth, and they must also be able to listen to the whole truth."
"European integration, thanks to which the greater part of our continent has lived in peace for so long, is, in effect, a unique attempt at a democratic confederation of states."
"It is not, nor will it immediately become, a fully-fledged federation or even a traditional confederation."
"It is simply something new."
"If only this attempt could be an example to others!"
"However, that is not the main point."
"It is my belief that the European Union has an opportunity to inspire the rest of the world with something still more profound than its model of cooperation between nations."
"By this I mean an opportunity to try and make amends for all of the questionable ways in which Europe has determined or influenced the entire character of contemporary civilisation."
"It is a movement that is perhaps slowly getting under way already."
"I have in mind here the rejection of the cult of profit at any price, regardless of the long-term and irreversible consequences, the rejection of the cult of quantitative growth and ever-increasing growth, the rejection of the crude ideal of catching up with and overtaking America or China or whoever else, and the rejection of a dangerous and unplanned colonisation of the Earth and the mindless looting of the planet with no regard for the environment or the interests of future generations."
"I also have in mind smart energy saving whereby the success of a state is measured not by the growth of consumption but, on the contrary, by the reduction of consumption."
"Of course, all of this is possible only on the assumption that a change will begin to take place in the soul of the contemporary European."
"He should be - confronted with the latest discoveries of cosmology - just a little more humble, he should think about what will happen when he dies and he should bow down in solitude before the mystery of the universe; in brief, he should once again relate more to eternity and the infinite, just as he did in the early stages of European development."
"We should reflect seriously on the fact that nothing that has been done cannot be undone, that everything is somewhere remembered - even if only in the form of flying light - and that nothing is therefore forgiven forever."
"To return, however, to Europe as a partner to others, it is the case that most of the wars in the history of the human family have been about borders, in other words, territory."
"From this comes the important lesson that not only nation states but also supra-national communities should always know exactly where they begin and where they end."
"Indistinct or disputed boundaries are a frequent source of disaster."
"The European Union should remember this too and be clear as to its external boundaries."
"If it wants to tear down a boundary, it must first know where the boundary lies."
"It would thus endorse the idea of geographical self-identification on a broader, which is to say planetary, scale."
"In this way, too, it could make a significant and concrete contribution to what we all long for, which is peace between the peoples and nations of this planet."
"The theme of shared sovereignty arises in European debates mostly in relation to the institutional arrangements of the Union."
"I applaud the Union for devoting so much energy to this theme in recent years and for the successes it has achieved."
"It is precisely for this reason that I venture to gaze further into the future over this matter."
"The parliament in which you are sitting is directly elected and an effort is made for the numbers of representatives from the various states to correspond to their size."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament, as the only body directly elected by all Europeans, should have rather more power than is actually the case today."
"The job of legislating should accordingly shift more explicitly from the executive to the lawmaking authority."
"The European Parliament must not appear to anyone to be merely an expensive adornment of the Union."
"In my view, another smaller body might eventually come into being alongside the Parliament and the members of this body would be elected by the national parliaments from their own ranks, with all Member States having the same number of members."
"In this way, or another similar way, it would be possible to resolve two issues at the same time."
"Firstly, it would eliminate the feeling which arises in various national parliaments of being excluded from European decision making."
"Secondly, it would ensure that there was at least one Union body here guaranteeing absolute equality to all member countries."
"Such a body would meet only rarely, of course, when a certain number of members requested it, and only in relation to issues requiring consensus."
"This solution would also mean that appointments to the Commission would not have to be made in such a complex way in accordance with the nationality key and the European Council would not have to have such complex vote-counting arrangements."
"I admit that I personally think it is more important to have commissioners who are genuinely the leading professionals in their field rather than to have my own fellow nationals or even fellow party members at any price."
"The European Council currently comprises an odd combination of executive and representative authority."
"Even its position needs to be clarified."
"I believe that it should be something akin to the position of a Head of State in a parliamentary democracy, comprising therefore a sort of partly obscure and partly visible collective head of the confederation of states, the visible representative of which, intelligible to all, would be an individual, of course, that is to say a president, whose existence is already envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty and who is a very important figure, bearing in mind that wherever some form of collective head of state appears, it usually presages the break-up of the state."
"I am not saying that this may also happen in the case of a supra-national community, but nonetheless I do feel that there should be a single human face somewhere at the top which would represent the entire complicated machinery and thanks to which all of it would be better understood."
"I have already said many times that I would consider it excellent if, sometime in the future, there could be a slim, intelligible and readable European Constitution which could be understood even by schoolchildren and if all the rest - now running to thousands of pages - could be mere appendices to this."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, as the text which formulates the values or ideals on which the Union is based, which it strives to conform to and which it bears in mind when taking decisions, would naturally form an organic component or actual first section of such a Constitution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a final comment which will, to some extent, bring me back to the point I started from."
"Viewed from afar, the European Union looks like a highly technocratic body, concerned only with economics and money."
"The eternal haggling over the budget, quotas, customs duty, taxes, business regulations and various other regulations are perhaps necessary and I do not condemn them in any way."
"I even think that the famous recommendations or standards on how to cook goulash - a common target for eurosceptic ridicule - are intended more as a protection of something Czech or Hungarian rather than as an attack on the Member State concerned and its identity."
"Nonetheless, however, I think that the Union should still place greater and more visible emphasis on what are actually the most important things, that is to say, its spiritual and value-related foundations."
"The Union represents an unprecedented attempt to construct a large and original supra-national community on the basis of respect for human freedoms and human dignity, on a foundation of genuine and not merely apparent or formal democracy and on a belief in common sense, decency and an ability for equal dialogue within the community and with anyone else."
"It is also based, of course, on respect for individual nations, their traditions, achievements, the territories they occupy, their homes and the landscapes in which these homes are located."
"And also, of course, on respect for human rights and human solidarity."
"Europe's rich spiritual and cultural history - founded on a combination of classical, Jewish, Christian, Islamic and later Renaissance and Enlightenment elements, has created a body of incontestable values, to which the European Union may have given its verbal endorsement, but which it often conceives of only as an attractive wrapping for the things that really matter."
"Is it not these values, however, which do matter first and foremost and is it not, on the contrary, these values which give direction to everything else?"
"I am not advocating anything revolutionary, epoch-making or radical here."
"I am merely advocating a more profound reflection on the actual basis of European unification, a more emphatic cultivation of our Europeanness and an articulate reference to a moral code which extends beyond the world of our immediate benefits, a world which leads nowhere and which uses only quantitative indicators to determine prosperity."
"It is twenty years since Europe's rift was healed."
"I firmly believe that the continent will never again allow itself to be divided and that, on the contrary, it will be both a space and a source of ever deeper solidarity and cooperation."
"If only Schiller's Ode to Joy could become for us and for our descendants more than just a poem celebrating friendship between peoples, expanding instead into an evocative symbol of our common efforts towards a more humane world."
"(Standing ovation)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if the Sakharov Prize had existed thirty years ago, you would have been the leading candidate for us, Václav."
"Fortunately, you no longer need this prize today, since we no longer have an old and a new Europe."
"There is only one Europe."
"Today it is our duty, as politicians, to respect the values of reconciliation and solidarity on which the Union has grown."
"Let us therefore do everything possible to ensure that they are not forgotten."
"(The sitting was opened at 15.50)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 22 October 2009."
"Tribute"
"It is with great sadness that I have learnt of the death on 17 October of our former fellow Member, Lady Diana Elles."
"Lady Elles was a Member of the European Parliament from 1973 to 1989 and performed the roles of Vice-President of the European Parliament from 1982 to 1987 and of Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Please rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague."

"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 22 October 2009 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following proposed amendment has been tabled with the agreement of the political groups:"
"Wednesday:"
"The title of the Commission statement on the political situation in Honduras with a view to the elections on 29 November 2009 will be amended as follows: 'Commission statement - Political situation in Honduras'."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the PPE Group does not agree with the change to the name that was on the agenda regarding Honduras, and disagrees with the suggestion that the title referring to the 29 November elections be deleted."
"The date of the elections is an extremely important part of the whole debate, and we consider that it should remain as it was."
"Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of retaining the new proposal, because, at the end of the day, it is clear that the negotiations in Honduras have failed."
"There is no joint proposal for this election."
"The election is illegitimate, because the incumbent president came to power as a result of a coup d'état."
"I therefore urge this House to agree to the suggestion from the Bureau to remove the elections."
"(SL) I am very much in favour of keeping the agenda unchanged."
"I was a member of the delegation of the European People's Party that travelled to Honduras and had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the situation there."
"There is no truth in the idea that the 29 November elections are taking place because of the events in June."
"The elections were called six months prior to those events and have no particular connection to subsequent political developments, nor could those developments have contributed to the emergence of any new candidates."
"I also think that the 29 November elections are part of the solution, not part of the problem."
"Everything suggests that we should keep the agenda as it is and that we should support the democratic development of this country in the future."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order: I do not have my voting card with me because it was not planned that there would be a vote now, and so I ask you to note my wish to vote in favour of the order of business remaining unchanged."
"On this occasion, a machine cannot replace me."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would say to all of you who have the same problem: thank you, but please do not take the floor."
"We can record the wishes of each one of you, but those wishes cannot be taken into account for the purposes of the vote or of the vote count."
"They are only taken into account in the minutes but not for the purposes of the vote count."
"I am sorry but you should always carry your voting paper with you because the vote can take place at any time."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 16.05 and resumed at 16.15)"
"Outcome of the European Council on 29 and 30 October 2009 including the mandate and attributions of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative of the Union for the foreign and security policy/Vice-president of the Commission, as well as the structure of the new Commission (debate)"
"The next item is the European Council report and Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council on 29 and 30 October 2009 including the mandate and attributions of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative of the Union for foreign and security policy/Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the structure of the new Commission."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, it is my pleasure to be back here again and to report to you on the results of what proved to be a very complicated and challenging European Council meeting."
"Let me explain the situation on the eve of the European Council."
"We were in constant contact with Prague and other capitals."
"How would we solve the Czech request regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"There were many different views, and there were calls for various exemptions and special considerations from several other Member States."
"In contrast, we got a clearer message on climate change - the other main subject for the meeting."
"The message from a number of Member States was that they were not ready to commit to figures on climate financing, i.e. how to finance adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries."
"Given these circumstances, I am satisfied with the outcome of the meeting."
"Let me point out the highlights."
"Our objective at the European Council was - as December's Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen approaches - to continue to lead the way on climate change."
"Let there be no illusions."
"The negotiations were both lengthy and difficult, but in the end, our discussions led to an endorsement by the European Council of the Commission's estimate of EUR 100 billion annually by 2020, and it estimated that the level of international public support should lie in the range of EUR 22 billion to EUR 50 billion by the same year."
"The year 2020 is only 10 years away."
"We need to act quicker than that, and so the Council noted that, in addition to this, we need global financing of EUR 5 billion each year from 2010 to 2012."
"A final figure will be determined in the light of the Copenhagen conference."
"The EU and the Member States are ready to contribute their fair share, if other key players make comparable efforts."
"I am very pleased that at this European Council, we were able to reach agreement on a strong mandate on this."
"A few days ago, I returned from talks with Prime Minister Singh at the EU-India Summit in New Delhi, and earlier last week, I held talks with President Obama at the EU-US Summit in Washington."
"Thanks to the agreement at the European Council, the EU was able to negotiate from a very strong position."
"Our unity gave us the credibility to encourage others."
"We were able to present our commitments."
"We were able to express our expectations."
"And we were once again able to lead the way on an issue that is crucial to all citizens."
"Last week's meeting was also about the economic and financial situation."
"Although there are signs of improvement in the world economy, the European Council stressed that there is no room for complacency."
"Next year, all but one of the Member States risk exceeding the 3% deficit ceiling, and our collective GDP has shrunk by 4.7% since the beginning of 2008."
"Both of these are strong reasons why we should not withdraw supporting measures until we have secured our recovery."
"In the meantime, we need to reinforce confidence and continue work on our exit strategies."
"At the European Council, we made significant progress on strengthening financial supervision."
"We reached broad agreement on the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board."
"The Presidency will now begin to discuss the proposals with this Parliament."
"We want to reach agreement on a package for a new supervisory structure."
"We want to make sure that we do not suffer a repeat of the financial crisis we have just experienced."
"With all this in place and on its way, we must focus on safeguarding jobs."
"Over five million Europeans have already lost their jobs, and far too many will still face unemployment."
"It is up to us to change this trend."
"When I presented the priorities of the Swedish Presidency to you on 15 July, I said that the EU must emerge strengthened from the crisis."
"I told you that handling the economic and financial crisis was one of our most important tasks."
"It still is."
"For this reason, we intend to return to these important issues at the European Council meeting in December."
"Another important outcome of this meeting was the adoption of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region - a strategy that is based on an initiative from this Parliament."
"Our ambition with the strategy is to address the urgent environmental challenges related to the Baltic Sea, and to contribute to the economic success of the region."
"I am convinced that this initiative will also have a positive effect on other parts of Europe, pulling regions together and making a positive contribution to the competitiveness of the EU as a whole."
"We also discussed justice and home affairs."
"We welcomed the progress made in implementing measures concerning illegal migration in the Mediterranean, and we called for work in a number of specific areas."
"I know that you also want to discuss institutional matters this afternoon."
"They were, of course, an important element of the discussions."
"Indeed, one of the key issues was to ensure the rapid entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which is crucial if we want to be able to confront the challenges that lie ahead together."
"The consultations were many and they were very complicated, but in the end, we managed to gain acceptance for the request made by the Czech Republic."
"With this agreement in place, President Václav Klaus was prepared to sign the treaty, and - as you all noted - he finally did so a week ago."
"The final instrument of ratification is now being deposited by the Czech Republic with the Italian authorities."
"This means that the Lisbon Treaty will enter into force on 1 December."
"I know that the vast majority of you here today share my satisfaction and relief that finally, this long chapter of preparations for institutional reform is coming to an end."
"The European Council also assessed other treaty preparations."
"It agreed on guidelines for the European External Action Service and it invited the future High Representative to present a proposal for the organisation and running of the Service."
"Now to the question of names."
"We need to fill the positions created by the Lisbon Treaty."
"We need, together with you, to appoint a new Commission."
"I plan to convene a meeting of Heads of States or Government on 19 November in order to nominate the President of the European Council, the High Representative and the Secretary-General of the Council."
"Let me stress that the nomination of the High Representative will have to take place before the new Commission is appointed, and that this should be preceded by appropriate contacts with this Parliament."
"As you know, since this person will also be Vice-President of the next Commission, he or she will also be subject to the Parliament's vote of approval."
"I will not speculate on who these persons will be, but I would like to say that it is not just the name that is important, but also what they will be doing and how they will do it."
"Last week's European Council enabled us to make significant progress, not just on one key issue, but on several issues that are vital for the future of Europe and vital for the future of our planet."
"I am grateful to my colleagues for their constructive attitude towards the challenges we face together."
"Nevertheless, you and I know that much remains to be done."
"I can promise you that the coming weeks will be very busy."
"I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with this Parliament on many of the important issues."
"The Copenhagen meeting is actually now only 25 days away."
"The economic crisis is far from over, but we have a solid mandate going into the climate negotiations."
"We are determined to continue to work together to generate new sources of growth and higher employment."
"I am grateful for the continuing support from this Parliament."
"I look forward to responding to your comments."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me complement Prime Minister Reinfeldt's assessment of the European Council by commenting on two aspects, one on policy and one on institutional issues."
"As regards policy, the key deliverable was the very important agreement on our action on climate change."
"We all know these are difficult issues."
"When there is so much at stake, the road will never be easy."
"Frankly, the European Council result exceeded my initial expectations."
"We got the approval of the numbers the Commission proposed, accompanied by strong conditionality."
"The message is clear: the European Union is ready for Copenhagen and ready to follow our action to cut emissions with a powerful offer on climate finance, just as the Commission proposed in September, both in the longer term and in 'fast start' funding."
"If we want developing countries to come to the table with serious commitments on mitigation, then we need developed countries to put money on the table."
"Our assessment is that by 2020, developing countries will need around an additional EUR 100 billion a year to tackle climate change and this was fully backed by the European Council, as is the likely share of public international finance in that figure, and agreement that the European Union will pay its fair share."
"It is equally clear: other partners must show that they can match the seriousness of our intent."
"Our policy is not about the European Union forging ahead in the vague hope that others will follow."
"It is about using our leverage to bring about the maximum possible in terms of a global effort to cut emissions."
"When I was in Washington and New Delhi last week, I was reminded just how far these two partners have come in the past year or so."
"The same is true of others, like China."
"Of course, we will continue to respect the important requirement of common but differential responsibility for climate change but, as I have said many times recently, we are all in this together, and we in the European Union will continue to push for real contributions from all the other players."
"We need to keep focused on the end goal - ambitious, serious, verifiable cuts in emissions to ensure that we keep within our target of limiting temperature increase to less than 2 °C."
"So what are the prospects for Copenhagen?"
"It now seems to be likely that Copenhagen will not see agreement to the fully-fledged treaty that we have pushed for and will continue to push for."
"But that is not a reason to accept anything less than a decisive breakthrough in these negotiations."
"In the end, it is content that matters more than form."
"In my view, we should try to arrive at a fully operational agreement, based on real political commitments, that comes rapidly into force, and which brings all the major players on board for both emission reductions and finance."
"And we should continue to fight on for final agreement to a treaty - a binding treaty."
"To make that happen, we need to join all our forces in the weeks remaining to Copenhagen."
"We have just shown that we can, by decisive joint action, agree on a treaty that has proven elusive for a very long time."
"That was the other major result of the European Council: it lifted the last political hurdle to the final ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Now we can look forward with confidence because, as Prime Minister Reinfeldt said, the Lisbon Treaty will be in place at the start of next month."
"In fact, the Commission is working on its implementation."
"Today, the Commission has launched a consultation on the Citizens' Initiative as a first, concrete step."
"I would like to pay tribute to Prime Minister Reinfeldt for his sure touch in bringing this ship into port."
"The Swedish Presidency has done very remarkable work in bringing this final consensus to the European Council."
"But now we have to complete the task of transition."
"The focus is, of course, very much on the filling of the new posts."
"It is not for me to comment on the candidates for the Presidency of the European Council but, as Commission President and looking at the institutional matters, I very much hope that Heads of State or Government will select the personality that can provide effective leadership to the European Council - a President with a strong European commitment that can give consistency over time to European Council activity, both internally, so that priorities can be set over a longer timeframe and not just for six months, and externally, so that on common foreign and security policy, we send coherent messages to our international partners."
"I am committed to working in tandem with this President of the European Council because that partnership will make all the difference."
"We need to pull together at the level of Heads of State or Government the common foreign and security policy on which the President of the European Council will represent the European Union at this level."
"We also have to put together all Community competences - from the economy to trade, from enlargement to development, from energy to justice - where the European Commission President represents the European Union according to the treaty."
"I am committed to making this partnership work in the interests of a strong and effective European Union at home and globally."
"That is obviously also true for the High Representative."
"Here, I confess to a particular interest because that High Representative will also be one of the European Commission Vice-Presidents."
"On a very pragmatic level, because the nomination of the Vice-President/High Representative, and the other proposals by Member States for the Commission, will allow me to pass to the phase of finalising the next College and attributing portfolios."
"On a political level, because I am convinced that this High Representative/Vice-President, supported by a strong External Action Service bringing together European expertise in intergovernmental diplomacy with our Community competences, can mean a real step change in the effectiveness of our external action."
"This brings me to the Commission as a whole."
"I want a Commission composed of competent and committed Europeans, a Commission that is ready to take all its right of initiative."
"I am working in my final discussions with Member States to ensure that this is the case."
"I have asked Member States to come forward with names, including women."
"Then it will be for me to decide on portfolios."
"Portfolios are not attributed to countries but to persons that are committed to our European project."
"I also want to have a Commission with a strong democratic mandate."
"That is why I am determined to give full respect to the hearings process in this Parliament."
"The delays due to the treaty have given us a common challenge."
"We must not delay the arrival of a new Commission, but we cannot short-cut the hearings."
"I look forward to discussing how to handle this issue in the Conference of Presidents next week."
"The Lisbon Treaty will enable us to deliver better on citizens' expectations - but whether we use the opportunities it offers will be, first and foremost, a matter of political will."
"The treaty gives us the capacity to act but we need the willingness to act together."
"That brings me back to the beginning of our afternoon."
"The Europe represented here today - a Europe united in freedom and solidarity - would not have been possible without the commitment and the dedication of people who made extraordinary things happen 20 years ago."
"We need to rekindle this flame."
"We need to have the spirit of 1989."
"If we show the same dedication and commitment, I am sure we will succeed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by the 27 Member States of Europe and has an obligation to produce results."
"It has an obligation to produce results with regard to the institutions and, in particular, to the swift creation of positions of responsibility."
"It has an obligation to produce results with regard to climate change and energy."
"And, last but not least, it has an obligation to produce results with regard to the economic recovery."
"With the signature of the Czech President, the process of ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon has finally come to an end."
"My thanks to Mr Reinfeldt."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which has very much left its mark on this treaty, is naturally satisfied with this development, but it is now time to stop monopolising the European public debate on the institutions, which are merely a tool with which to serve political ambitions, and to focus on those ambitions instead."
"That is why my group is asking you, Mr Reinfeldt, to do everything it takes to obtain an agreement as quickly as possible on the names of the Council President and the High Representative, and that is why my group is asking you, Mr Barroso, once the Member States have nominated their candidates, to divide up their responsibilities as quickly as possible before they are questioned by the European Parliament in hearings, which we also want to be as in-depth as possible."
"I will not be telling you anything new, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, when I say that the debate on the profile of these candidates is of interest only to the Brussels microcosm."
"Once again, what do our fellow citizens want?"
"They want their unemployment, credit and training problems to be solved; they want some pleasant surprises to come out of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change; and they want us to ensure that the winter of 2009-2010 is not marked by gas shortages that put half of the continent in an impossible situation."
"Therefore we, the European institutions, here as I speak, and especially you, Mr Reinfeldt, have a duty to get the Europe train moving at high speed, not have it continue to stop at every station!"
"Everyone knows, in this House, the difficulties involved in the task, the difficult balance that you have to find between the political tendency, geographical origin, concern for equality and receptiveness of the candidates."
"However, it is your duty to finalise an agreement at the Council as quickly as possible, just as it is the duty of Parliament and of the parliamentary groups to give their verdict on these decisions responsibly and in accordance with the European general interest."
"Once again, I hope that this will be one of the success stories of the Swedish Presidency, but for this to be the case, we must act fast, very fast."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, even more urgent than the matter of the institutions is that of climate change, with the Copenhagen Summit being just a few weeks away."
"I want above all to commend the responsible attitude of the European Council which, at the same time as reaffirming its commitment to make the fight against climate change and the reduction of CO2 a quantified and planned objective, expects our partners to commit themselves with the same determination."
"It would be by far the wrong tactic for Europe to lay all its cards on the table before Copenhagen and to let its US, Chinese, Indian and other partners call the shots."
"The United States, China and India are today global powers that must also assume their responsibilities."
"Europe is assuming its responsibilities, but it cannot do this for the planet by itself."
"A political agreement will not suffice in Copenhagen."
"What counts are the quantified commitments made by the states."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I began by talking about the obligation to produce results."
"This obligation concerns, first and foremost, the economic recovery and employment."
"The two are linked."
"Even if we are starting to see signs of small-scale growth returning, it is all about knowing whether the economic recovery will be accompanied by jobs, and if that recovery is built on solid foundations and, in particular, on a market that is at the same time open, regulated and non-protectionist."
"Those are the real concerns of Europeans, and this must be the number one concern of Europe and of its Member States, beyond the day-to-day administration problems."
"As we have seen today, 20 years ago it was determined men who succeeded in bringing down the Wall."
"I ask the same of you, Mr Reinfeldt: shake up the Heads of State or Government!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, perhaps it is a coincidence - although a happy coincidence - that this debate is being held immediately after the speech by Václav Havel, a man who has reminded us how important this process was twenty years ago."
"I was born just a few kilometres west of the Iron Curtain, but it could just as easily have been the other way round."
"At that time, I was in the Soviet occupation zone and I saw the Hungarian refugees of 1956, the refugees from the Prague Spring in 1968, such as my fellow Member, Libor Rouček."
"I see in the Treaty of Lisbon an extension of this process that is bringing Europe together."
"It was probably not the intention of Václav Klaus to complete the ratification in precisely the month in which we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it is a happy coincidence that this treaty attains de facto validity right now, even if it does not quite yet have legal validity."
"We now need to take decisions with regard to people."
"I do not envy you this task, Mr Reinfeldt."
"However, I do have a request or a question for you: are you prepared, in your talks with the Heads of State or Government in the next few days, to ensure that in this Europe, we also attain something close to a geographical balance that is representative of the new Europe?"
"Are you also prepared to ensure a stronger representation of women, perhaps?"
"I am not just saying this on account of Mrs Malmström and Mrs Wallström, who are sitting here."
"Can Europe today afford to have top positions - and I am speaking to my own group too - in which so few women are represented?"
"Is that the image that represents Europe to its people today?"
"The President of Parliament has already mentioned this."
"You are not, of course, to blame if this does not happen, but I ask you, at least during the talks, to point out that we need a better geographical and, above all, a better gender balance in Europe in order to show that we represent the whole of the European population."
"You mentioned the High Representative."
"Are you prepared, Mr Reinfeldt, to also ensure that it is made clear that, when you nominate a High Representative, he or she will not assume full duties until ratification has taken place or there is a decision of this Parliament?"
"I know that there will, of course, be a gap in time, but it must be clear that, in his or her joint role as Vice-President of the Commission, the High Representative requires approval by Parliament."
"We will need to be very careful and conscientious in giving that approval."
"We need to make it clear that, particularly in this area, we will perform our duty and, Mr Barroso - I believe we can promise you this - although we want to carry out these hearings properly and carefully, we also want to reach our decisions as quickly as possible, as the citizens of Europe demand that we work and come to decisions quickly rather than spending months discussing various people."
"The last point that I want to touch on is the financial crisis, which you have mentioned, because that is also something that causes us great concern."
"You rightly mentioned unemployment, which is also set to rise further."
"You also said that we cannot withdraw the support measures while we still have unemployment on this scale, as the citizens also expect us not to accept as high a rate of unemployment as we have now in this new Europe."
"There is also the debate about the financial transactions tax."
"I know that it has already been assigned to others five times, but it is probably also an important debate to show that we are serious about the control but not because we now want high tax burdens."
"However, we need to make it clear that we want to use all of the instruments to help to stem speculation and that, above all and in order to prevent a new crisis, resources are available to help those banks that, in spite of this, still get into difficulty."
"We need to send out clear signals in this regard."
"The head of Goldman Sachs recently said - and we need to let these words sink in slowly - 'I am just a banker doing God's work'."
"That is surely a particularly cynical and perhaps blasphemous statement, but it shows the sort of mentality that many of these people have."
"They are speculating in the name of God, to put it bluntly."
"We do not want to claim that it is God's work that we are doing with our financial regulation, but rather it is work for the people, to protect the people of this continent from unemployment and speculation, and that is what we need to do."
"I hope that you will still be able to send out clear signals along these lines throughout the remainder of the Swedish Presidency."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Reinfeldt, and Mrs Malmström too, of course, on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It should be stressed that it is thanks to your determination that this was made possible; it is thanks to your sense of compromise that we finally achieved it."
"For there were many pessimists, including in this Chamber, who thought that we had to wait for the UK elections, or even stop waiting for the ratification of this treaty altogether."
"It is therefore thanks to you, and I thank you on behalf of everyone for the work that has been done."
"This means that almost 10 years of work are thus being crowned with success."
"I also wish to thank you for today's debate, for having agreed to a debate with the group chairmen on the profiles of the High Representative and the President of the Council and on the structure of the Commission, because this will be the only debate on this issue."
"Nothing else is really being done transparently, I must say!"
"We read many things in the press, and it is a good job that we still have the press to learn a little of what is going on, but I believe that, in future, we will have to think about how we can bring some transparency to a process that is extremely important for the European Union."
"I am going to give my opinion on the various nominations, addressing the different points in a slightly different order."
"I am going to start, Mr Barroso, with the structure of the Commission, because that is the most important thing as far as Parliament is concerned."
"It is our responsibility, well, it is your responsibility, but it is in association with you that we must take decisions."
"It is we who supervise, whereas that is not the case with the President of the Council."
"What we are asking you to do for the first time, in your proposals, is to use clusters when dividing up the responsibilities."
"What we are proposing is that you in fact create four clusters, or groups, of Commission portfolios: external action, obviously, then innovation, climate change and sustainability, followed by everything to do with financial and economic justice, and, lastly, internal affairs."
"This is absolutely necessary."
"Why not install vice-presidents who would really take the lead, who would take responsibility for each of these groupings, which seem to result from the common sense shown within the Commission?"
"This style of organisation would have the advantage of further improving the Commission's work under your presidency."
"On the other hand, there also has to be a balance as regards female representation within the Commission."
"I believe that it is also a concern of yours to have candidates who offer this possibility."
"With regard to the second point, Mr President, namely the post of High Representative, the most important thing is that we have someone who has the will to conduct a consistent CFSP policy and consistent Community policies, someone who also defends human rights and who makes this a part of every task that he or she carries out."
"And, finally, we must have someone who believes in a powerful European External Action Service."
"Those are the three key elements that characterise this figure."
"We need someone who really believes that CFSP and Community policies must be integrated - which makes perfect sense, given that that person will also be Vice-President of the Commission."
"I now come of course to the third nomination, the one most spoken about, the one that is, let us say, the most attractive of all, namely the President of the Council."
"Mr Reinfeldt, my group has three opinions to voice on this issue."
"They are simply opinions, since it is the Council that will decide."
"Fortunately, however, Parliament can give opinions and can do so openly."
"Firstly, this role must be that of a chairman, rather than a president, to use those two English words."
"Next, it must be performed by someone who believes in European integration."
"After all, to be elected Pope, one has to be a Catholic!"
"Thus, if we now elect a President of the Council, we have to choose someone who believes in European integration, not a sceptic, as is sometimes the case ..."
"Finally, in order to be sure of the person's firm belief in European integration, he or she has to believe in the Community method."
"It is the Community method that drives Europe forward, not governmentalism!"
"Governmentalism is a concept of large countries, even though there are, fortunately, large countries that do not believe in this intergovernmental method."
"It is the Community method that the President of the Council must defend."
"I have one last point to make by way of conclusion, Mr President: I naturally call for Mr Reinfeldt to find a consensus within the Council, and for the pro-European coalition that exists within this Parliament to be reflected in the nominations and the division of the various roles."
"Therefore, what we want is indeed a compromise, but one that also reflects the composition of this pro-European alliance that drives Europe forward within this European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, I believe that it is precisely the recollection of the historic events of 20 years ago that has now allowed us to see the wrangling over how to implement the options after ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is a critical light."
"Václav Havel's splendid words and his ideas about Europe, on the one hand, and the petty disputes over staffing that went on in the background during the last Council, on the other, do not go together, somehow."
"In my view, it looks, at the moment, like the relief over the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon after almost ten years is giving way to concern about whether or not it will all be undermined in the governments of the Member States."
"However, what we actually need to strive for - particularly given how strongly we applauded Mr Havel's speech - and what we actually need to achieve is to agree that we need strong men and women to be appointed to the top political positions in the European Union and that individual interests, including the interests of the countries that are actually opposed to stronger integration, should take a step back."
"Mr Reinfeldt, I am not yet able to congratulate you, because, as yet, there is no convincing sign of these strong men and women at the head of European politics."
"The huge praise that various speakers have expressed for what we have achieved in the run up to Copenhagen is also something that I, unfortunately, cannot go along with."
"I have just returned from the last United Nations preparatory conference in Barcelona and, as confirmed in the summit here in Brussels, we are going to Copenhagen with ever decreasing expectations."
"It is wrong that Europeans have now adopted the stance that we have actually already done everything we can and now it is up to everyone else."
"If we look at what the Europeans have actually already done in terms of an efficient climate policy for reducing CO2 emissions, what has actually been achieved, the reduction targets we have set, the legislation in our climate package, none of that is sufficient to achieve the two-degree target that is constantly talked about."
"Everyone knows that, even at an international level."
"If the Europeans now start to question whether we really want a legally binding agreement, it will call into question a process that, under the aegis of the United Nations, has been supported by many Europeans for many years."
"I think you need to think carefully about the announcements you make as you go to Copenhagen."
"There is always one concern at the back of my mind: it is frequently said in this House that sustainability strategies, resource efficiency and climate protection should be the new paradigms for European economic and industrial policy."
"Mr Havel also received a great deal of applause for this."
"I have the impression that Europeans - as often as they emphasise this and as much as they like to applaud it - have lost all faith in these future-oriented jobs during the economic crisis and that, therefore, precisely during this economic crisis, they are casting aside the successful strategies for creating new jobs and the markets of the future."
"This causes me serious concern."
"The economic crisis is the worst justification for not taking ambitious measures to protect the climate."
"Climate protection and economic development are actually two sides of the same coin."
"However, that is not at all evident in the European decisions being taken in the European Council."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, may I first congratulate the Swedish Presidency on progress at the recent summit in developing the European Union's position on climate change."
"Tackling climate change is one of our highest priorities and is the kind of issue where we expect and want the European Union to take a strong lead."
"The balanced and measured agreement on financing arrangements is very welcome and places the Union in a strong position as we work towards Copenhagen."
"But I must mention the debate that now seems to dominate Europe's agenda: the appointments of the President of the European Council and the High Representative."
"We should start by defining clearly their scope and nature, and then we should establish the qualities and experience of the people needed to fill them."
"Surely it is logical for the European Council to invite formal nominations and to hear candidates, perhaps including Mr Verhofstadt, ahead of the decision."
"Instead, the discussion is degenerating into a shabby debate between government leaders who appear only to be interested in sharing out jobs amongst themselves, be it from small or large countries, north, south, east, west, Left or Right, and not whether someone is actually the best candidate to take the responsibilities."
"What is worse, some have even tried to divide the European Union into two classes of citizenship by saying that only individuals coming from a Member State in the Schengen area and in the euro area should be eligible."
"That, I am afraid, is discrimination which is unacceptable, and this on a day of history when we remember all those who have fallen in warfare and in a week when we have remembered the horrors of Kristallnacht and the tragic events which followed, and where we have celebrated the achievement of all those who contributed to the fall of Communism, in Poland, where it began, in Hungary, in the Baltic States, in countries throughout Eastern and Central Europe and, of course, ultimately in Berlin."
"It is right to fight for freedom and values for all, not big jobs for the lucky few."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by all 27 Member States."
"Many will be celebrating this as a great success, but my group will not be joining in these celebrations."
"I have stated the reasons for this many times in this House and I do not intend to do so again."
"Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU's great progress in the protection of fundamental rights."
"I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel's speech."
"However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose."
"We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so."
"In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights."
"Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies."
"The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change."
"In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself."
"For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed."
"Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action."
"It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region - although I do not begrudge you that."
"It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world."
"Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands."
"Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level."
"Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges."
"If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the new post of President of Council, with which everyone seems to be fairly obsessed, is an appointment for two and a half years only and has very few defined powers."
"So somebody should tell Tony Blair not to get too upset if he does not get it!"
"After Lisbon, the true Holy Roman Emperor of the 21st century - the Charlemagne of our times - whose writ extends farther than that emperor's ever did, is, of course, the President of the Commission, our very own Senhor Barroso."
"And I say this despite Senhor Barroso's comments on partnership."
"However, it is rather different for the new High Representative."
"There is a big budget to open new diplomatic missions, and I must point out that the existence of the post of EU High Representative threatens the permanent seats on the UN Security Council held by the United Kingdom and France, too, Monsieur Daul."
"However, the big problem facing the nation states of Europe is not too few diplomatic missions but too many unemployed."
"Members here have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall - and rightly so."
"But now we have a new Berlin Wall, not on the frontiers of nations but within nations."
"This wall is between the professional politicians of the political establishment and the people."
"It is a bit too late to be asking for transparency now, Mr Verhofstadt."
"There are those of us here who will continue to speak for the people and to speak out against these institutions which, as the EFD Group has said before on several occasions and will do so again, are short of democratic legitimacy."
"(DE) Mr President, democracy needs a revolution, and it is never wrong, Mr Dartmouth, to speak out in favour of transparency, Mr Verhofstadt."
"You in particular, in the Swedish Presidency, could be a shining example of this and actually tell us what is going on in the horse trading for the top posts that is completely unworthy of the European Project and also - Mr Barroso could lead the way on this - with regard to the appointment of the commissioners."
"Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard, but so, unfortunately, are others."
"There are qualified people sitting in this Chamber, but they have no chance of being accepted."
"Please, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted, be courageous and honest and admit that we need much clearer, transparent decision-making structures for the Commission and for the top posts."
"With so much expertise, it has to be possible to find good people in the European Parliament rather than gathering them from some province or other."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I thank the honourable Members very much for their many valuable comments and questions."
"As someone stated, it has taken quite a while to get 27 Member States to ratify."
"We have been discussing this treaty for many years, and I am always surprised to find that I then get questions on how quickly we can stop living after that constitution, because I must base my work on the treaties."
"It has been defined there that the decisive bodies for the Council President are the Prime Ministers and Heads of State of Europe."
"That is actually what has been put into the treaties."
"Added to that, a problem which is obvious to me is that most of the people that are mentioned are current Prime Ministers of different European countries."
"It is actually a tense matter to portray oneself as a candidate for a job you might not get, sending a signal to the people that you are leaving the country and then coming home again and saying, 'Well, I am still here!'"
"I think we should respect that this is a factor when it comes to this issue."
"On the High Representative, you will have much more transparency, much more discussion, because that will be part of the Commission, part of a decision taken after hearings inside Parliament."
"Although, to answer Mr Swoboda, it is clear in the treaty coming into force on 1 December that the High Representative goes directly into his or her new job, but has to be part of the Commission approved by Parliament."
"This is, of course, complicated but, just to state the obvious as I said the last time, it was never meant to be the way it has now turned out."
"This was supposed to already be in place before the Swedish Presidency."
"It is a much lengthier process than anyone could foresee."
"On the issue of balancing, because this is something that I also hear, I have just today had the first round of consultations with my 26 colleagues."
"The problem is that it is a lot of balancing for only two persons."
"You mentioned geography and gender, but the number one balancing that I am listening to is between Centre-Left and Centre-Right."
"There is a lot of balancing to do, and I would have liked more positions to be able to satisfy all the criteria that have been mentioned here."
"To say the obvious, it is not that we are not trying to find the best possible balance."
"As I said, this will be next Thursday at our summit meeting with an early dinner to meet all your requests for as quick a process as possible."
"That is what we have been trying to do."
"There were comments on who is taking this decision."
"It takes a little while just to consult everyone."
"We are now EU-27."
"Full consultation with my colleagues involves two days' work - this is fantastic, but it takes time."
"On climate, I agree with Rebecca Harms that Europe is not doing enough."
"I also want to remind you that we have foreseen a situation where we need to increase our efforts in Europe within legally binding targets, but there is a need for conditionality."
"This reflects the views of many of my colleagues."
"They are very precise that, if we should go even further in Europe, we also need the same kind of commitments from other parts of the world."
"I welcome country- or nation-based decisions which have gone further."
"We have many examples of that."
"My country for instance, Sweden, has taken a national target of a 40% reduction until 2020, and this is true for Germany as well."
"We need to do more - and we are not the ones asking to dilute the decision we need to take in Copenhagen - but a lot of work needs to be done to get others to move."
"As I said, I am back from my travels to India and the United States, and am going to China later in this month, and we need leadership agreement to get this going."
"That is the tough thing with this."
"It is a global challenge in a world where we do not have the kind of global leadership or decision taking that we have in the European Union."
"It is therefore much tougher to deliver but, at the same time, we need to do it."
"The European Union, as you know, only accounts for 13% of global emissions."
"We cannot solve this on our own: we also need commitment from others, especially the major emitters, and they are the ones who seem to be raising their hands and saying we want to be outside of the agreement."
"That is not possible, as we could never then deliver on the 2 °C target."
"Finally, during the Swedish Presidency, we will now try to push through the better supervision of the financial market that is needed to get better functioning financial markets for the future."
"We will also start discussions that will continue into the Spanish Presidency on competitiveness, on how to get better functioning labour markets, and on how to get out of the crisis once we see clear signs of recovery."
"This, then, is a balance between learning from the problems we had and creating better-functioning financial markets, but also the discussions and the decisions needed to get better competitiveness and better-functioning labour markets here in Europe."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to comment briefly on some of the issues that were directly put during the debate."
"First of all, regarding climate change, let us be clear. The European Union is committed to a binding treaty."
"We have been committed to the Kyoto Protocol and have ratified it."
"All of our Member States have ratified Kyoto, and we are in favour of a binding treaty for the future."
"If there is anyone who does not want a binding treaty, it is not the European Union."
"But the reality is that some of our most important partners are simply not ready for it, so there are two possibilities."
"One is to insist on something that we know is not going to work, another is to try to have the most advanced and ambitious outcome at Copenhagen."
"I believe it is still possible, and we will fight for it."
"To have the most ambitious possible agreement at Copenhagen and - at least for the European Commission, and I am sure the Heads of State or Government agree - we will remain committed to a binding treaty that sets clear targets for the developed countries and clear actions for the developing countries, including the fast-growing, big emerging economies that also have a responsibility to share."
"We also need to provide funding to the developing countries - especially the poorest and the least developed countries - because we know very well that, without that support, they will not be able to make the adaptation and mitigation efforts that are needed."
"(FR) With regard to the institutional question, let us be totally honest with ourselves."
"We are now on the eve of the entry into force of a new system that is extremely demanding."
"Most of us have fought hard to have this treaty, over many years, at least nine years!"
"After Nice, we wanted a more ambitious treaty, and now we must implement it."
"It is complex, because our Union is complex - it is a Union of Member States, a Union of citizens."
"The most important thing, however, is precisely respect for the treaties."
"We are a Community based on the rule of law, and the day that we fail to honour our commitment to show full respect for the treaty will definitely be the day that we fail in our duties."
"That is why it is crucial in this transition - and when the new treaty is implemented - that respect be shown for the treaties and for the powers of each institution: the powers of Parliament, of course, the powers of the Council, and the powers of the Commission."
"I myself am one of those who believe that Europe stands still when one institution uses its power and its authority against the others."
"I believe that it is a mistake to act in that way."
"I believe that institutional jealousy is a characteristic shared by mediocre individuals."
"On the contrary, I believe that we will be stronger if we strengthen one another."
"I believe that it is entirely in our interests to have a strong European Parliament - and the Treaty of Lisbon gives it increased powers - but also to have a European Council with a consistent and coherent leadership over time, and a strong Commission."
"Moreover, in accordance with the treaties, and I cite the Treaty of Lisbon - because we talk about it all the time, but we need to read it sometimes too - Article 17 of which states that it is the Commission that 'shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end."
"It shall ensure the application of the treaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them.'"
"In other words, it is the Commission's job to verify whether or not the treaties have been applied, including during this transition."
"This is a power that the treaty gives to the Commission and which the Commission will, of course, exercise within the scope of its responsibilities."
"That being said, it is important to work on a partnership basis in order to strengthen the European institutions."
"If we do not have institutions that work, what will happen?"
"The Member States - especially some Member States - will tend to take their own decisions outside of the institutions."
"Is that what we want?"
"I do not think so."
"We want decisions to be taken within the institutional framework, within the framework of a Community based on the rule of law, and this is what I would like to say to you very frankly and very sincerely: let us mutually strengthen our institutions."
"We have heard today the extraordinary plea made by Václav Havel."
"It is extraordinary, but as Jean Monnet said, nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions."
"We now need to put in place strong institutions, and that can only be done in this spirit of partnership."
"That is why, among other things, I wish to thank you for your suggestions concerning the organisation and structure of the Commission."
"Like you, I am very attached to the Community method and to the treaty, which provides for a clear division of responsibilities."
"Under the treaty, the responsibility for the organisation of the Commission falls to its President, and I have no intention of renouncing it."
"Therefore, when I present the Commission, I will do what all modest authors do: I will thank all those who advised me, while assuming full responsibility for the final product."
"Today, I have heard some good and interesting suggestions, but the crucial point to understand is this: each of us must exercise his or her responsibilities coherently with the other institutions, while showing, of course, the greatest possible consideration for the European general interest."
"(ES) Mr President, the President of the European Commission was saying that he congratulated Mr Reinfeldt on having brought the ship safely to harbour, the ship in question being the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway's novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones."
"Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there."
"Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia."
"I must say, however, that I believe that what you have done, in seeking the agreement with the President of the Czech Republic, is right."
"Many of us in this House were troubled by the behaviour of the President of the Czech Republic, but there is a Spanish poet who says: 'after everything, everything has been nothing'; in the end, the important thing is that the treaty is in force and that now we are thinking about the implementation of the treaty."
"Mr Barroso, it is not my intention either to give you any advice on how you ought to form your Commission, partly because I respect the autonomy and independence of the President of the Commission, who has received a substantial vote asking him to do this."
"When you present your college of Commissioners and the division of responsibilities, we will tell you whether we are for or against, but today, you have our full support."
"Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty."
"In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the 'Bruton clause', after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post)."
"However, we later removed this condition - Mr Duff remembers - and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals' DNA."
"Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister?"
"Mr Reinfeldt, you should rather seek out the person who can best represent moral authority, who can be the broker of agreements in Europe."
"In order to do this, we have given you a tool, Mr Reinfeldt: it is the fact that the election of this President of the Council does not have to be unanimous, but may be by qualified majority."
"Therefore, consensus is desirable, if it is possible; if not, use the qualified majority to seek out the best President of the Council."
"(SV) Mr President, I am pleased that the Swedish Presidency has abandoned its desire to push for quick moves to exit strategies, which would risk making the high rates of unemployment a permanent problem in Europe."
"However, I am concerned that more and more people are warning that the climate summit in Copenhagen will not be the success that so many have hoped for, and this has been reflected in many of the speeches in this debate and the questions put to Mr Reinfeldt."
"This pessimism is also evident in the conclusions from the last Council meeting."
"Admittedly, the Council confirms that the developed world must reduce its emissions by 80-95% by 2050, but if we are to succeed in doing this, ambitious commitments are needed in the very near future and, to achieve this, we must resolve the issue of the financing of the measures in the developing countries."
"It is those countries that have contributed least to climate change that will be affected most by it and if we do not resolve the issue of financing, we will not get a climate agreement either."
"What promises is the Council making, then?"
"Just as Mr Reinfeldt said here today, the EU has promised to make a reasonable contribution."
"In my view, this is an anticlimax."
"Would it have been possible to decide that the EU would not make a reasonable contribution?"
"In my opinion, it is like starting to knit a glove and not getting any further than the thumb."
"The Commission has proposed aid in the region of EUR 5-7 billion during the first three years."
"The Council is choosing to take account of this and I find it very difficult to see it as a commitment of any value."
"I think this is worrying."
"Certainly, there are problems with the US and China and with other countries' ambitions, but there are even greater problems with the EU's position and our own ambitions."
"It should be possible to put this right, and if Mr Reinfeldt had seen fit to remain here, I would have liked to have asked him how the Swedish Presidency intends to acquire a stronger mandate ahead of the Copenhagen Summit, because this must not come to nothing."
"(DE) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which, fortunately, has entered into force, will give us more democracy and a hearing procedure for the High Representative."
"All of the commissioners come here, first so that we can listen to what they have to say and then so that we can subject them to scrutiny, and rightly so."
"However, the President of the Council does not undergo a hearing here, nor is he subject to scrutiny by us or by any national parliament."
"His position is badly designed from a democratic point of view."
"He cannot be the political President of Europe, he has to be no more than an honest broker between the different interests of the Member States in the Council, and the minimum requirement for his appointment is that there is a consensus in the Council."
"As Mr Verhofstadt has just said, when choosing a pope, we choose a Catholic, when choosing the President of the European Council, we choose a European, in other words, someone who believes in the European ideal."
"I think that is absolutely right."
"We need someone who can put the 'European' back into the European Council."
"If this debate - requested by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - had not taken place in Parliament, we would all have only discussed this matter in the media or in the corridors."
"I believe that transparency is necessary for the forthcoming appointments."
"To Mr Reinfeldt I would like to say:"
"This is not just about balancing Centre-Left and Centre-Right; this is about balancing the Centre, the Left and the Right."
"(FR) Mr President, climate change has already caused 300 000 deaths, and inaction, for us, is a crime against humanity."
"We know that this is an emergency, we know that there is no plan B, and yet, today, the negotiations are at a standstill."
"It is easy to say that it is the United States' fault, but we believe that Europe is also hugely responsible."
"Europe is unfortunately no longer, as the Prime Minister claims, the leader in the climate-change negotiations."
"Extending Europe's current commitments to the entire planet means having 4 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, 4 degrees of global warming!"
"That is unacceptable, and it will no longer be enough, as President Barroso is also claiming, to hide behind the legislative character of this commitment alone."
"Independent studies show today that Japan, Norway and Switzerland are ready to make greater efforts than Europe."
"With regard to the emerging countries - China, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia - they too are making commitments domestically that go beyond what the scientific community is asking of them."
"If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel's speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic."
"Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community."
"In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit."
"It is not too late;"
"Europe can resume its leadership by immediately increasing its reduction target to 30% and by granting at least EUR 30 billion in aid to the countries of the South."
"In so doing, we will lead the countries of the South and force an agreement out of the Americans."
"(PL) Mr President, the outcome of the Council in October is a good basis for placing restrictions on the completely unrealistic measures Europe is being expected to take in the area of climate change."
"The action we take in the area of climate change should be made conditional on efforts made by China, America, India and Brazil."
"The contribution we pay towards clean technologies in developing countries must not ruin our own economy."
"Let us remember that it is, in fact, economic growth which gives us the opportunity to finance the technological changes which are of key importance for protection of the environment."
"The breakdown of the contribution in the European Union itself must not give rise to a situation in which countries which use large amounts of carbon to generate energy pay twice for the same emissions - once under the emissions trading system, and a second time as part of the support for clean technologies around the world."
"If we do not take this point of view into consideration, we will weaken Europe's position in this debate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, a serious ruling by the Strasbourg Court created a very deep wound - on which the European Commission has expressed itself far too cautiously - by banning the Italian state from displaying crucifixes in classrooms."
"The issue is not so much one of religious principle as one of the principle of freedom: this was a grave violation of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Now, if this is an indication of what is to come, there is reason to fear how this issue will pan out with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon: are we sure that this dangerous path of having a European law that suppresses and rides roughshod over the Member States' laws will not be pursued?"
"This is a danger that we must guard against."
"The Commission should have reacted much more firmly, not least because of the unanimous protest - today there has been a cross-party meeting of the Italian political parties represented here - which represents the sentiment and the depth of feeling of our people towards this belonging, which is metapolitical, metareligious and cultural, in the sense of a great philosopher, who taught us with the important words, 'we cannot say we are not Christians'."
"The issue of the nominations is very important."
"Consequently, today, we are reading in press reports rumours of meetings; we do not even know whether there will have to be an extraordinary meeting in Brussels."
"I do wonder about something, however: studying the names that are circulating - for example, Jan Peter Balkenende, David Miliband and Herman Van Rompuy, to name but three - can it be possible that no one has noticed that all three regularly attend meetings of both the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission?"
"I believe that we must establish principles of transparency, which are so often spoken about by our institutions, and we must ask these people clearly whether they are candidates representing their countries and their political parties, or representing secret groups that meet behind closed doors and take decisions over the heads of the peoples."
"(ES) Mr President, now that the worries generated by the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon have been overcome, it is time, in my view, to think about the way in which we should, in future, handle the nationalist attitudes that do so much to hinder European integration."
"My view is that these obstacles cannot be free of charge."
"With a cool head, it is time to think about the possible measures that will need to be taken in the days and years to come."
"This simple MEP wants a President of the Council in the future who is a man, or, better, a woman who supports European federalism, uses the euro, is located in the Schengen area and identifies and agrees with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Welcome"
"I should like to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, of the presence in the official gallery of a delegation from the Senate of the Federation of Malaysia, to whom I extend a warm welcome."
"The delegation is led by His Excellency Datuk Wong Foon Meng, President of the Senate."
"I would like to point out that the European Parliament and the Malaysian Parliament enjoy regular and fruitful contact."
"Malaysia has a vibrant society and a thriving economy, and it plays an important role within the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)."
"Therefore, I and the entire House have the pleasure once again of welcoming our friends and colleagues from the Senate: we hope that your visit will be very productive."
"Outcome of the European Council on 29 and 30 October 2009 including the mandate and attributions of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative of the Union for the foreign and security policy/Vice-president of the Commission, as well as the structure of the new Commission (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Council report and on the Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council on 29 and 30 October 2009, including the mandate and attributions of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative of the Union for foreign and security policy/Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the structure of the new Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the speech by Mr Borghezio was typical - these eurosceptics cannot distinguish between the Council of Europe and the European Union - as the ruling on crucifixes was given by the European Court of Human Rights, which comes under the Council of Europe."
"This could not be done under the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, allow me to make a few comments on the current debate."
"I believe that the Swedish Presidency has brought the ratification process to a conclusion with great sensitivity and in a targeted manner, when, of course, this process still had to be completed by four countries within its period of office."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the fact that this process, which lasted nine years, has been steered home in this way."
"I believe that this will also give us the opportunity to put this into practice for the first time, because what happens in practice also determines constitutional reality."
"For that reason, it must be clear that the President of the European Council has only the legitimacy of the Heads of State or Government, and in any constitution, any operational president who is not answerable to Parliament is directly elected by the people."
"That must be the case for the President of the European Council, too."
"Only the President of the Commission has full legitimacy."
"I would also like to draw attention, as Mr Barroso also mentioned in quoting Jean Monnet, to just how important the institutions are for our lasting existence."
"As far as the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission is concerned, it must be clear that, when he takes office, he will immediately take on both roles."
"He cannot first take office as the High Representative on 1 December and then later as the Vice-President."
"He can only take office, as can the Vice-President, once he has been approved by the European Parliament."
"There should be no misunderstanding about this, because otherwise we will have legal problems."
"I would also like to mention that the European Parliament will exercise its rights with regard to the External Action Service."
"We do not want the Treaty of Lisbon to be used to 'intergovernmentalise' Europe."
"That is not the spirit of the treaty."
"The External Action Service will play a decisive role in this regard."
"I would ask you to take seriously Parliament's position on this matter, which you are, of course, aware of, and not to make statements in this regard to the effect that we would destroy you because we have the power to do so."
"Mr President, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty is indeed an historical event."
"We should applaud it."
"We should be happy about it."
"We should congratulate ourselves and certainly we should congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the fact that they achieved this result."
"A treaty, however, is not enough."
"Even the most perfect treaty could not, by itself, solve many of the problems."
"We need inspired and competent people to enhance it."
"In the case of the Lisbon Treaty, this is even more important since this treaty is the result of endless compromises, long discussions and long debates."
"Therefore, unavoidably, it has a lot of ambiguities and gaps."
"It is for the future top decision makers to clarify things, to fine-tune the rules, to shape the institutions, to give the right interpretation to all provisions of the treaty and to detail the job description."
"The coming mandate, the coming legislature, will be crucial for the European Union architecture of the future."
"If we want this architecture to be viable, it must be a synthesis of all the historical experiences, cultural sensitivities and political traditions of all European regions and all European citizens."
"Therefore, we need the team formed by the first three functions in the European Union - the President of the Council, the President of the Commission and the High Representative - to include all political sensitivities, all regions, and all geopolitical, cultural and geographical regions of Europe."
"I believe that this will be achieved and I believe that, if this is achieved, it will be good for the viability of the architecture and the effectiveness of the institution, but also for the credibility of the Union in the eyes of all our citizens."
"(FI) Mr President, permit me to thank the media for once."
"Without a free and vigilant media, the public would be completely unaware of the choice of EU leaders."
"Fortunately, however, we do have the media, which reports on the lobbying process and has presented the unlikely and likely candidates both for the post of EU President and High Representative."
"Even in this debate, in fact, there has been rather little talk of names, and only a few have been mentioned."
"All the same, we try to guide others outside the EU on the importance of democratic elections."
"A while ago, I had an opportunity to visit Turkey, and when we were talking about the choices to be made in the wake of the Treaty of Lisbon, a member of the Turkish Parliament there asked when the choices would be made, and the European Union delegation replied that it had no idea who the candidates were or when the choice would be made, as everything was taking place behind closed doors."
"The EU has much scope for improvement here, to enable us to act more transparently in such matters."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on the informal discussions which we all know dominated the last European Council."
"I refer, of course, to the selection of the next President of the Council and the role he will take."
"I believe that the President should be the servant of the Council - a chairman rather than a chief executive."
"It is therefore important that the President is both collegiate and someone the people trust, and, with that in mind, the worst possible candidate on both scores would be one Tony Blair."
"I share Chancellor Merkel's dread of having to listen to Mr Flash for the next five years as his motorcade sweeps around the world."
"The issue of trust is also important and on too many occasions, Mr Blair has shown himself to be completely untrustworthy."
"He is unfit for public office and I urge the Council not to appoint him."
"(NL) Mr President, I read with great interest the Swedish Presidency's document on the European External Action Service."
"Yet my scepticism about this project is undiminished."
"At all events, I think it sensible of the Swedish Presidency to allow additional time for seeking the right candidates for the new posts, as the High Representative needs to be of the kind of outstanding calibre rare in Europe."
"Mr President, I am still very concerned about the impact of these new posts on the interinstitutional balance."
"My fellow Members cannot fail to share my opinion."
"Unlike them, I am pleased that the external service is to remain outside the Commission."
"Foreign policy is primarily a task for the Member States and, should it be Europeanised all the same, I would prefer the climate of the Council to that of the Commission."
"This is exactly what is happening now, despite all our well-intentioned resolutions."
"(NL) Mr President, this haggling about the appointment of the President of the European Council is far from edifying."
"For example, in Belgium, we are currently seeing the candidacy of our Prime Minister, Herman Van Rompuy, being supported with arguments along the lines of 'he is unobtrusive, he has relatively few enemies, he is good at reaching compromises'."
"The underlying reasoning is that anyone who can govern an artificial country such as Belgium can do likewise in Europe."
"Yet it is not in the interests of anyone in Europe for the European Union to evolve into a larger version of Belgium."
"Besides, Herman Van Rompuy does not actually govern as prime minister."
"The Belgian model can no longer be governed, which means that Mr Van Rompuy is more a kind of caretaker of the status quo and, in effect, merely takes care of day-to-day business."
"We do not need a colourless, flavourless, odourless figure who dances to the tune of the European Commission."
"What we need is a powerful mouthpiece for the Member States, and also for the citizens, who, unfortunately, are not taken into account in all this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, we peacefully ended the violent division of Europe into freedom and dictatorship."
"The European Union is the political project that made the reunification of our continent possible."
"The European Union is the political project that sets itself the goal of extending the zone of peace, freedom, democracy and stability in Europe."
"We are responsible for strengthening the community of values and the community based on law."
"We must do everything we can, starting right here and now, to ensure that the joy over what has been achieved will give us the strength and determination to make sure than no new walls or barbed-wire fences are constructed between the people of our continent and the rest of the world."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is the greatest advance for democracy since the first direct election thirty years ago and it gives the European Union, the institutions, the opportunity and the ability to become the voice of the continent."
"However, we must seize this opportunity!"
"We must have the political will to transpose and implement the treaty."
"If we have this political will, then it also means that we need to stop always looking only for the lowest common denominator."
"Any form of opt-out weakens the Community."
"We will only have put a stop to the crises once unemployment falls consistently and we once again have sustainable growth without having to inject billions that cause our public deficits to soar."
"My last point is also clear: European thinking is about meeting each other half way and seeking out the best solutions."
"The discussions about appointments over the last few days lead me to fear that we are not looking for the best, European solutions, but for the easiest solutions for the Member States and the political parties."
"That is the wrong response to the developments of the last few years and to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to make two comments, each regarding aspects of the conclusions of the European Council from the perspective of the chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and, therefore, involving the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The first is on immigration: I welcome the fact that immigration occupied a significant place in the conclusions of the Council and I think it important that immigration policy is going to be, for the first time, a Community policy and that it is going to be the subject, during the Spanish Presidency, of an initial assessment that will involve the role of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments."
"At the same time, however, since there was a reference to solidarity in aspects of the management of immigrant movements, I regret the fact that this was not done under the binding solidarity clause, with its financial implications."
"The second has to do with the institutional dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice, because this is going to entail a 'before' and an 'after' in the activities of this Parliament."
"Finally, there is to be a Community policy; at last, the European Parliament will be taking the decisions on it."
"European citizens are entitled to hope for much from the conclusions of the European Council that will mark the end of the Swedish Presidency on 10 December, with the area of freedom, security and justice at last being enshrined as a major sphere of action that is genuinely European, and genuinely humanitarian, through the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, to which the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is making a decisive contribution through the report that will be adopted this week."
"Mr President, it is great that we can now close the final chapter on the saga of the treaty."
"However, I regret that we had to pay the price of extending to the Czechs the extremely poor precedent of the British protocol on the Charter."
"The press is reporting the protocol as being an opt-out from the Charter."
"I would be grateful if the Presidency, in concluding the debate, could confirm that this is far from the position and that the Charter will still be binding upon the Czechs and their President sitting in his castle."
"The import of the protocol is to constrain the practice of the courts in deploying the Charter during their domestic litigation, which is something far inferior and peripheral - and, at the end of the saga, negligible."
"(PL) Mr President, in spite of the grand declarations that the Lisbon Treaty would improve the function of the European Union, it turns out that it has opened a Pandora's box."
"Its provisions are not precise, and not only are they causing controversy, but they are already causing a division among the EU's leaders."
"The treaty does not specify the prerogatives of the future President of the European Council, nor does it specify a democratic procedure for election to this position, and the President's real standing will be dependent on strength of personality and previously held function."
"It is also difficult to see whether the classic model of national presidencies, which set the tone of EU policy, will be retained."
"Things look similar with regard to the European Union Minister for foreign affairs."
"The majority of Europe's citizens are waiting for an answer to the question as to whether we are moving towards the establishment of a strong European federal state at the cost of the sovereignty of nations and if, in the future, a strong Council President will not want to revert to the antidemocratic traditions of 20th century Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks also to the Swedish Presidency for the crucial results obtained during this six-month period."
"At the same time, however, allow me to offer you - I am addressing the Swedish Presidency here - a gift: the gift is this blank sheet of paper, which you can use over the next few days as an extraordinary instrument for overcoming the difficulties that exist in identifying the candidates for the post of President of the European Council and of High Representative of the Union for foreign policy."
"In fact, if you convince the Heads of State or Government to write on this sheet not the string of names appearing in the newspapers and on the television, but the idea that they have of European Union foreign policy, then we will have made a major step forward, because if they make it clear to us whether they believe, for example, in greater coordination, or in a genuine foreign policy, it will be easy then to put a face and a name to the person who will have to represent us in the world."
"This is the real transparency that we need: to understand what our idea of Europe and of European Union foreign policy is, what we are most attached to."
"It is therefore crucial that the people chosen are those who embody the spirit and the values of the European project, someone who can guarantee Europe a leading role in international relations, who, to be effective, must reaffirm the ideals characteristic of its founding fathers, the only true unifying and thus explosive element on the world stage."
"The European Union is not a monolithic bloc but the product of the actions of men and women and, as such, it must keep up with the times to stay alive."
"Europe, in short, must start afresh on the basis of the values on which it was created, the fine results that we have achieved thus far, and, believe me, a good dose of realism too."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the work it has done and for having succeeded in putting in place the conditions for the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We sorely need the new treaty because it offers us the possibility of strengthening, of extending powers, for example, the powers of this Parliament, and of two new figures, who can represent political and institutional union."
"We therefore hope that the Council will be able to interpret the requests of the great European political families wisely, so that at the next meeting, an authoritative and strongly supported decision can be taken on the appointment of the persons called upon to occupy the new institutional positions envisaged by the treaty."
"What do we need?"
"We need a President of the Council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity."
"We need a High Representative who, on the strength of his or her experience and authority, is capable of guaranteeing Europe a leading role in a multipolar world, and who, at the same time, will act as a link between the intergovernmental and the Community dimension of the Union."
"And then we also need a college of commissioners that is strong, united and balanced in terms of politics, geography and gender."
"It is particularly significant that this is happening 20 years after the fall of the Wall, the wall that divided Europe, and all this can rekindle hope in a united, strong Europe that will continue to drive the demands for solidarity and justice."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to offer my thanks and congratulations to the Swedish Presidency for the truly remarkable work it is doing."
"However, I should like to take advantage of this speech to address President Barroso through a third party: Mrs Malmström will therefore certainly pass on to him the comments that I have to make, following, moreover, his speech in response to Mr Verhofstadt."
"We all want an effective and credible Commission, one that makes full use of its power of initiative and that is not scared to practise the Community method."
"However, if we want that Commission - and I understood that Mr Barroso wanted it too - then I believe that it must structure its action around competences organised within four or five pillars, each pillar being placed under the political responsibility of a vice-president invested with the authority and the ability - and with the power too - to ensure the consistency of the entire policy within his or her pillar."
"The current division of the Commission's competences - and I am well placed to speak about this, since I was, after all, a commissioner for five years - undermines the Community method, handicaps the power of initiative and harms your institution."
"Please tell Mr Barroso this, on my behalf."
"That it was difficult immediately to reorganise the structure of competences inherited from what were, at times, odd, if not opportunistic, arrangements of the past is understandable, but I would not understand it if the current president failed to establish the order that a new ambition for this institution deserves."
"(FR) Mr President, thanks to the tenacity of the Swedish Presidency, which I too thank, we have the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, a treaty such as this is not a project, but a tool, a toolbox to serve the European project, and it is therefore up to the men and women who manage the institutions - the Commission, its president, the Council - and to us here to make good use of these tools in the future, at the end of a transition period that has been long, too long."
"For we are now better equipped to take up three major challenges in the face of which, ladies and gentlemen, we will together be playing not only for the credibility of the European Union, but also, to repeat the word used by Mr Havel just now, for its sovereignty."
"The first challenge is that of the crisis, and we must not - we cannot - come out of it as we went into it, as if nothing had happened."
"There are lessons to be learnt in our dialogue with the United States, in particular, regarding governance, regarding solidarity, regarding transparency and regulation of the global economy, and for we Europeans there are lessons to be learnt as regards the safeguarding - I use that word deliberately - the consolidation of the internal market, in the 'reconciliation of the market and society', to repeat a word that I have adopted as my own, used by Mario Monti, to whom President Barroso has moreover usefully entrusted a task on this issue."
"The second challenge is that of green growth."
"In Kyoto, we took the lead on this issue, thanks to the European Commission."
"We must maintain this position by ensuring, of course, that our partners, the other large countries, the large regions, adopt a reciprocal attitude."
"And then, the third challenge is for us to be at the table, not 'behind the table', but 'at the table', of those who are going to decide on the world order - or disorder - over the next 20 years."
"This is not easy when we number 27 nations, but it is crucial all the same, unless we do not mind - which I personally do - being subcontractors or being under the influence of the other countries."
"This is why we have a great deal of confidence in the future work of the High Representative, whose job it will be to create a real common diplomatic and strategic culture."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens."
"That is why we eagerly and confidently await the decisions that you will take."
"(HU) I would like to make an exception and not talk about the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Rather, I would like to say on the outcome of the European Council regarding the economic, financial and social chapter that we are, in one respect, delighted to see that the signs of financial stabilisation feature in this document too."
"This is how we see the situation ourselves, but in the meantime, it is also clear that people's reserves are dwindling in Europe."
"Companies are finding it difficult to obtain financial assistance and bank loans, while unemployment is on the rise."
"This is also mentioned in this document."
"I think it is important to emphasise that economic growth cannot be sustainable nor can we talk about Europe emerging from the crisis stronger than it was until we can clearly guarantee that the current level of social cohesion is not only maintained but strengthened and until we can increase employment and prevent social exclusion."
"The methods we have for coordinating social policy, based on an open approach, are fairly ineffective."
"We must improve our coordination methods."
"In fact, we need more effective tools."
"Social cohesion and the achievements of a social Europe are those factors which people consider the most important."
"It is our shared responsibility to highlight this fact."
"(SV) Mr President, politics and psychology go together and right now, many people are trying to talk down expectations ahead of the Kyoto negotiations in Copenhagen in a few weeks' time."
"Precisely the same thing happened when we negotiated the climate targets."
"The climate targets that we proposed and worked for in this Parliament had been declared dead and buried not once, but perhaps ten times, by the time we obtained the final decision."
"It is exactly the same with the climate package."
"It has been declared dead and buried by those who, in fact, are opposed to the climate targets."
"I would therefore call on the Swedish Presidency to continue its good work in the negotiations and its constructive line, because if we do not aim for a fully binding agreement in Copenhagen, we will not achieve it."
"However, the two degree target is extremely important and therefore we must now push forward with full commitment."
"Seneca once observed that humanity can be divided into two groups: those who go on ahead and do something and those who walk behind and criticise."
"(EL) Mr President, I have noted exactly what the Presidency said about the economic crisis, but it is clear that, with the exception of one country, none of the others can apply the Stability Pact."
"Moreover, the economic crisis should not ultimately turn into a crisis of values and principles."
"On the question of climate change, the Presidency did precisely the right thing."
"However, it needs to persuade not only the developing countries, but also the United States of America, if the situation is to change."
"It must take a real initiative in Copenhagen."
"On the third issue, the Treaty of Lisbon, we are satisfied."
"Nine years after the crisis with the Treaty of Nice and the inability to find a response to the institutional question, we have before us a treaty about which several sides pestered us before signing."
"It is not only the institution and the treaty that are important."
"The people who apply it are also important and, in this sense, the Presidency is also responsible, at European Commission level, for ensuring that the people responsible - mainly the Minister of Foreign Affairs - express all the interests of a well constructed Union."
"On the other hand, at Council level, and I refer in particular to the question of the President of the Council, this is a matter which many of us did not accept."
"As a member of the European Convention, I personally know that many of us would have preferred the position of President of the Council to be filled by the President of the Commission, which has also happened in the past because, in essence, the role of President of the Commission is to coordinate with the Council and to avoid disruptive clashes."
"I trust that both the Presidency of the European Commission and, more importantly, the Presidency of the Council, will make appropriate recommendations to the Member States, so that the way in which both institutions operate is such that it does not differ from the Community modus operandi and the excellent past we have in Europe which has secured us so many years of prosperity."
"(ES) Mr President, I think that the agreement on the Czech problem was a reasonable solution; it was not perfect, but it was the best solution, and was necessary for such a serious problem."
"I think that 2010 may be a great year for Europe."
"It has a new College of Commissioners, a new organisational structure guiding the European Union, and a new legal status: the European Union is now a single entity, called 'the European Union', with its own legal personality, and not a sum of different nations."
"Now we have, as has been said, the opportunity to act, and we need the will to act."
"I believe that Europe needs to overcome the very serious nationalistic tendencies that are preventing progress being made."
"We ought to reflect on how much we would have advanced, ten years ago, towards the European Union with the euro if we had not given up the franc, the mark, the peseta, and so on."
"We need to recreate something of this approach within the European spirit, as Mr Barroso was saying."
"I would like to mention two things that I consider to be essential."
"One is an urgent matter: the College of Commissioners must be approved in December in Strasbourg."
"I think that it is very important that the next Presidency, in January, should take up its mandate with this new path - with a new College of Commissioners - already in place at the end of this year."
"Secondly, I want to reinstate the reason underlying the European Union - what the European Union is striving to achieve."
"I think that at the world's major forums of debate, very important decisions are at stake and that Europe must speak with a single voice, and with a strong voice, to advocate the special features of our project: a social model and a new legal, economic and political structure for a world in which the state plays a more significant role and in which there is a better market."
"Europe needs a louder voice that is more united and stronger."
"(SV) Mr President, the Swedish Presidency is to be congratulated."
"That stubborn man in Prague has finally signed and we have now reached the end of the journey at last."
"Hopefully, it will not be institutional issues that take up our time over the next decade, even though Václav Havel, being a true European hero, was prepared to take further steps right away."
"The fact that the Czech Republic was granted exemption from the Charter of Fundamental Rights is disappointing, in my opinion."
"As Mr Duff pointed out, it is quite enough that Poland and the United Kingdom have opt-outs."
"A global agreement must be reached in Copenhagen in which the wealthy nations of the world take a greater share of the responsibility."
"The poor nations of the world are not responsible for the warming of the planet."
"At the same time, of course, the growing economies must do their bit."
"Finally, Minister, the process ahead of the summit next week, when a president and a foreign minister are to be appointed, should have been carried out with greater transparency."
"The current secretiveness is embarrassing for a democratic Europe and I believe that I am not the only one to hold that opinion."
"Mr President, I would like to make three observations."
"With the Lisbon Treaty in force, the EU needs, more than ever, efficient common foreign security and energy policies which are based on solidarity."
"Only such policies can prevent Schröder-Putin deals from ever being repeated."
"Secondly, we need to realise how important it is in the new situation to have a continuously strong Commission that can take responsibility for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Thirdly, regarding the new top posts, we first of all need courage to advance and to support not portfolios but personalities, personalities that have long-term vision and commitment to the continuity of European values."
"So, in order to address enormous new challenges, the EU once again needs two European statesmen in the Adenauer, Schuman or De Gasperi mould."
"We should look for them without prejudice."
"These statesmen can also be found in the new Member States, which certainly should be represented in the future troika."
"Václav Havel told us today that Europe is a homeland of our homelands."
"Based upon this understanding, I think we can succeed in the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"(LV) I would like to say what a pleasure it is that the Treaty of Lisbon is finally to enter into force, and to talk about who ought to be the President of Europe."
"Presiding over the European Council does not mean presiding in Europe, but rather being together with the European Union Member States, the Member States' leaders, and supporting and encouraging them to reinforce the European Union's role among tomorrow's leading global states."
"I would like to say that Mrs Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, Latvia's former president, has all the personal leadership qualities and political leadership experience to make her a successful president of the European Council."
"Her fate symbolises the history of our divided continent - a refugee after the Second World War, she returned to Latvia; as soon as our country was free again, she returned to become its president."
"During the eight years of her presidency, Latvia became a Member State of the European Union and of NATO."
"Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga is a staunch European citizen."
"She is a highly educated and powerful figure who thoroughly understands the challenges of Europe's future."
"She will definitely also be able to take unpopular decisions, should that be necessary."
"(HU) Madam President, as a representative of the first Member State to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on Hungary's behalf."
"An excellent job has been done."
"We have seen a Czech in this House who is a friend of Europe, Mr Havel, while Czech President Klaus has caused a rather great deal of concern and has not shown himself to be a friend of Europe."
"We must finalise as quickly as possible the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointment of the new Commission and the establishment of the relevant structures so that we can focus on the real work."
"I regard it as very important that the Treaty of Lisbon is the first to feature the rights of persons belonging to minorities."
"I urge Mrs Wallström, who is a great champion of minorities, to mention to President Barroso to keep his promise that the prospective commissioner for fundamental rights will deal with minorities' rights, including those of indigenous minorities, such as the Sami, and those of immigrant minorities and the Roma."
"Madam President, in Ireland, they are asking us whether there is great excitement now that the Lisbon Treaty has been ratified."
"In truth, I tell them there is not because it took so long and the birth and delivery were so difficult."
"There is relief and some pleasure but a realisation, as there is in this debate, that the real work begins now and that it is a tough job to appoint the right people."
"It is not about jobs for the boys and girls, but about appointing the right people for all of those very important positions that have been created."
"I am sorry that it is taking extra time to do that because it does delay the final formation of all the institutions - and we have a lot of work to do - but perhaps it is better that we have that slight delay and get the right people in place."
"The top jobs, as we have described them, are important, and they will require people with commitment, dedication and a desire to improve the European Union, not just to be in a job."
"Lastly, on strong institutions, Mr Barroso is absolutely right."
"You need to hear what we are saying in this Parliament."
"Listen carefully."
"We are the closest to our electorate."
"We are directly elected."
"(RO) I very strongly appreciate what has been said by Mr Reinfeldt and I welcome, in particular, the fact that the European Union reached a common position for the Copenhagen conference at the European Council in October."
"The European Union has already adopted, off its own bat, robust measures for combating climate change, making progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions."
"However, it is obvious that the European Union's solo effort cannot guarantee absolute success at the international negotiations."
"I believe that it is extremely important for the European Union to make the transition to a reduction target of more than 20% only while retaining certain conditions, without which we consider that the EU's effort would be excessive."
"The conditions ought to relate, in particular, to the mandatory legal nature of the future agreement."
"In addition, specific targets for cutting emissions should be adopted by the developed countries on a par with those adopted by the EU, along with the corresponding contributions from the developing countries."
"(FI) Madam President, we have a very interesting arrangement in this House at the moment, which is that all three institutions are being represented by a woman: Mrs Malmström for Sweden, the country to hold the Presidency, Mrs Wallström for the Commission, and you, Madam President, for Parliament."
"I would like to see us have leading women in top posts regularly in the future, and a lot more than now."
"I know that Mrs Wallström and Mrs Wallis, Vice-President of the European Parliament, put forward an interesting initiative and included us other leading women in Parliament and the Commission in the process."
"We wrote to the Commission's President, Mr Barroso, saying that we wanted to see changes and that we wanted to see a fairer balance of women and men in the Commission and other top positions."
"I would hope that we can now seize the opportunity, because, although the President of the European Commission supports our ideas fully, the Heads of State or Government are, unfortunately, not doing anything to take responsibility for this woeful situation."
"We cannot allow the Union to be represented continually only by the faces of men."
"(SK) I would like to begin by expressing my support for President Klaus and the position of the Czech Republic."
"I imagine that, just as Germany had to listen to the decision of the Constitutional Court, Mr Klaus also had to wait for the decision of the Constitutional Court."
"As far as his approach is concerned, I consider his actions to be the responsible actions of a statesman who, as long as he felt a measure of legal uncertainty, waited for the opinion of the relevant institution, which was the court."
"I would also like to point out that the Lisbon Treaty is entering into force at a time of economic crisis in Europe."
"The current decisions of the governments that have taken steps to overcome the economic crisis were not effective, were not efficient and from this perspective, I think that we must proceed in future in a more coordinated way and not take ad hoc decisions which fail to produce a sufficient effect in terms of supporting employment and economic development."
"I therefore believe that when appointing the new Commission, we must ensure that it is staffed by experts and professionals."
"(HU) I firmly believe that the Treaty of Lisbon will undoubtedly enable Europe to function on a more secure basis and in a more logical manner, with a stronger focus on the problems affecting citizens' daily lives."
"However, we must also ask what price we have paid to achieve this."
"The price we have paid was actually that we have undermined our values and let pragmatism triumph over values."
"You know what I am referring to here."
"The European Union granted the Czech president his absurd request, not to mention that he said that a Czech opt-out was needed due to the Beneš Decrees."
"Let me remind you that under the Beneš Decrees, many millions of Hungarians and Germans were disenfranchised and deported."
"In my view, what the European Union did is unacceptable from a legal, political and moral perspective."
"We have criticised the Czech constitutional system from a legal perspective, we have monitored the view of the Czech Parliament and we are including the document politically in any future accession, having possibly penalised a country which has nothing to do with this, Croatia."
"From a moral standpoint, it is unacceptable to give an opt-out on such an issue."
"(RO) I welcome the European Council's adoption of the strategy on the Baltic Sea region."
"This is a model which the European Union must also apply to the Danube region, thereby contributing to the economic development, as well as the economic and social cohesion, of this region and, last but not least, to the European Union's competitiveness."
"The European Union will attend the Copenhagen conference as the leader in the battle against climate change."
"The European Union has already assumed unilaterally the '20-20-20' objective."
"The energy and climate change package is part of Community legislation and is in the process of implementation."
"I urge the European Union to establish quickly an effective, innovative framework for financing the eco-efficient economy."
"In addition, the European Union must also focus on financing the appropriate measures for adapting to climate change."
"Last but not least, the European Union must be able to generate investment in industry and public services in order to safeguard jobs."
"(HU) Madam President, Mrs Malmström and Mrs Wallström, two decades have elapsed since the Iron Curtain was torn down."
"While, in some new Member States, the change of regime has taken place within the legal framework and state structure, the past is still present in political attitudes and in the authorities' reactions in tense situations."
"Let us just reflect on the events which took place in Budapest in autumn 2006, where those whose most fundamental freedoms and human rights were trampled underfoot at that time have still not received truth and justice to this day, not to mention those belonging to national minorities in new Member States who, even now, encounter the bitter experience of discrimination, affecting their rights and opportunities."
"Precisely because of the provisions contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Commission must be prepared to ensure that when the portfolios are created, appropriate emphasis is placed on the issues of human rights and freedoms inside the European Union."
"At the same time, the remit of this portfolio must extend to protecting the rights of traditional national minorities and linguistic minorities as well, as we feel that there is still a great deal to be done in this area."
"Whether we like it or not, unsolved problems affecting these indigenous communities are present within the European Union."
"The European Union must deal with them and it is its duty to help citizens fighting to exercise their rights."
"(PL) Madam President, adoption of the long-awaited Lisbon Treaty is now behind us."
"It will surely lead to a strengthening and improvement of the European Union in the future."
"For today, introduction of the treaty requires a number of decisions concerning authority, personnel and, above all, establishment of a formula for cooperation between the new leaders - the leaders who have to make the new vision of Europe a reality."
"Matters connected with the treaty must not prevent us from seeing problems of immediate importance, that is, the active fight against the economic crisis, measures to tackle the rise in unemployment and organising the supervision of financial institutions."
"An understanding in Copenhagen is important and necessary, but a time of crisis is not a good moment to make decisions about how much will be allocated to this objective by which countries and international organisations, and what commitments they will make."
"The most important task today for the EU and its Member States is to resolve economic and social problems."
"Madam President, it is a great honour for me, like my colleague, Mrs McGuinness, to be here today on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall and on the eve of the Lisbon Treaty coming into being."
"This is a privilege, especially as Ireland voted by 67% in favour of the Lisbon Treaty, which was a reflection of the endorsement of the work of the European Union over many years."
"In years to come, people will also look at the dismantling of the USSR and see that civil wars were not widespread as a result, as happened in so many countries, my own country included, when peace and freedom came to the country but led to civil war."
"Historians will point to the role of the European Union in offering support and guidance and comfort to these countries so that civil war did not follow on a widespread basis."
"Finally, there has been much talk about the names of people to fill the functions of President and High Representative."
"I think we should also look at the title."
"If the President is not a President per se, then say he is a Chairman; why not call him a Chairman?"
"Having three Presidents is confusing for the public."
"Madam President, I would like to say first of all how pleased I was to attend the Development Days in Stockholm and to congratulate the Presidency on the way those days were organised."
"I took part in a debate recently on the Irish public service radio, RTÉ, with a woman who was very concerned that we were cutting health spending and not doing enough to cut back on development aid spending."
"I had to explain that it was not a matter of either/or but that it was a matter of both."
"We can do both."
"I would urge, given that we are concentrating so much on the need for recovery in Europe and the need to deal with the crisis we find ourselves in - which, of course, must be at the top of our domestic agenda - that we do not lose sight of the fact that 11 million children are dying each year in the developing world, five million of them because they do not have medicines we have had for 30 years."
"So please keep that at the top of the agenda and make sure, when we appoint the new person in charge of external relations, that dealing with this issue remains one of our key objectives."
"Well done on what you have done so far."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that the Treaty of Lisbon and the appointment of the members of the Council should come 20 years after the fall of the Wall."
"The fall of the Wall marked the start of the real Europe."
"Twenty years ago, a wall came tumbling down, a wall of concrete but one full of prejudices, tyranny and hunger for so many citizens of the East, and today we should stop celebrating the fall of the Wall and ask ourselves instead what we should do now that it has gone."
"In fact, other walls have gone up in the meantime: the wall between countries of the North and the South of the planet; between richer and poorer countries; between countries that produce goods and countries that produce ideas."
"These walls are much higher and much more difficult to bring down; they may cause major problems for humankind as a whole, as well as wars."
"For this reason, the European Council candidates, who will have to be nominated after Lisbon, must not be nominated by a small few behind closed doors."
"Those who want to make a contribution and who want to stand as candidates must make the European Parliament and Europe as a whole aware of what they intend to do and what they are able to do."
"If we knock down that 'nomination' wall, whereby the future candidates are selected on the basis of balances among nations and not of their personal qualities, then we will have finally built the nation of Europe."
"Madam President, the British opposition leader has announced an intention to renegotiate parts of the Lisbon Treaty."
"That would, of course, require the consent of all 27 countries."
"He has also announced the introduction of a Sovereignty Bill, which would force a referendum in the event of further treaties."
"This, of course, could easily be repealed by subsequent governments."
"Would the Council and Commission agree that the Conservative leader's plans are just hot air?"
"His party must decide either to accept the Lisbon Treaty or, in my opinion better still, take the United Kingdom completely out of the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a very interesting debate, and I thank you for your comments."
"The Swedish Presidency shares your joy at seeing the Treaty of Lisbon finally ratified in the 27 countries."
"This will give us a more effective, more democratic Europe, and a stronger role on the international stage."
"I am delighted about that."
"I also agree with those who said that, although it was perhaps a coincidence, President Klaus chose a very good week to sign the treaty: the same week that we are celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the communist dictatorship, the start of European unity and, finally, the victory of Robert Schuman's ideas over those of Joseph Stalin."
"(Applause)"
"Speaking of the Czech Republic, I would like to respond to the question from Mr Duff by saying that what the Czechs have received is not a total opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Protocol 30 does not suspend the mandatory nature of the Charter in respect of the UK, Poland or the Czech Republic."
"It merely limits the way the Court can use it and, ultimately, it will be up to the Commission and the Court to interpret it whenever a conflict might arise."
"As the Prime Minister said before leaving, the consultation with his 26 colleagues is now ongoing."
"It is difficult, but it is his goal."
"He has already invited them to a working dinner next Thursday."
"It is too premature to speculate about the names yet."
"I also read the papers."
"I have heard names that you do not want to see; I have heard names that you would like to see."
"I thought I spotted one or two applications for the job here from Parliament also."
"You are welcome to send your applications to the Presidency - we will look into them."
"There is still a week left before Thursday."
"And, of course, we hear your concerns about regional balance, gender equality - something that I myself think is extremely important."
"We should be able to show to European citizens that Europe is not only run by men."
"But there are, as the Prime Minister said, only two posts to be created."
"All those requirements are very difficult to meet, but we will do our best and have listened to your advice."
"When it comes to the High Representative, he or she will provide and finalise the framework that we just adopted on the European External Action Service."
"He or she will do that, together with Parliament, before presenting it to the Council no later than April next year."
"As has been said many times, the High Representative will also be subject to questions and hearings here in Parliament and thereby be able to discuss and develop his or her views on foreign policy."
"On the economy, I wanted to say to Marita Ulvskog, who is perhaps not here at present, that the Swedish Presidency is not at all giving up its ambitions on exit strategies."
"On the contrary, it is extremely important that we stick to the ambition of - not now, but in a little while - two exit strategies."
"Because if we do not, if we allow our economies to increase budget deficits, that will hurt the most vulnerable people in society, and we do not want to do that."
"We do see light at the end of the tunnel."
"There is economic recovery on the way, but we will still suffer in most countries from high unemployment and, therefore, it is too early to implement the exit strategies."
"However, we need to discuss them and we need to have a plan to do that, if we want to have a sustainable economy to give to future generations."
"Finally, on climate change, we have not lowered our ambitions."
"The Swedish Presidency, the Commission and many others work day and night."
"We convince, we negotiate, we argue, we try to drag our partners with us and we try to get them on board."
"There have been numerous meetings, and there are still meetings left, even if there are only 25 days left to Copenhagen."
"It is true that there is awareness globally and that lots of things are happening in many countries all over the world."
"That is encouraging, but it is not enough if we want to respect the 2 °C target."
"We do not have all the pieces of the puzzle in order to achieve a legally binding deal: that is a fact."
"I deplore it, but it is a fact."
"We can say that we still strive for it, we still do, but it will not happen because several partners say that they are not ready to take this step yet."
"Europe is still in the lead, and we still keep on working for a very ambitious agreement with a clear framework which includes all partners and a timetable for concluding the negotiations."
"The aim is to replace Kyoto with a binding agreement."
"I wish to thank Parliament for the work it is doing on this at present as well the work it will have to do after Copenhagen."
"Europe is still in the lead."
"We will keep on being in the lead."
"We have the highest ambitions, so far."
"We have confirmed the Commission's estimates and are backing them."
"We are ready to play our part."
"There will be a global distribution key based on emissions and the ability to pay."
"We have a working group looking at the internal burden-sharing."
"However, the Member States did not feel ready yet to reveal the exact figures that we will pay."
"This is because we want to keep on putting pressure on other countries because they should also pay for this as it is in their interest."
"So, we will spend every waking minute working on this."
"We thank you for the encouragement and look forward to working together with Parliament on this and other issues."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The implementation of the legislation on trading pollutant emission certificates incurs costs which will be allocated in different ways in each country, according to the economic model in that country."
"Some countries already have a wider range of options enabling them to cut emissions without any significant increase in energy prices."
"The countries which are still going through processes for restructuring the energy sector would feel the impact of these measures disproportionately at consumer level, in relation to their ability to pay the costs of the changes."
"A country which has a large proportion of wind energy in its energy mix has taken the liberty to invest in renewable energy resources when it has already developed, causing pollution in the process."
"On the other hand, a country which still depends, to a large extent, on coal-based energy production is facing a technological gap which it needs to bridge, while also reducing its pollutant emissions."
"Eastern European countries are in the latter situation."
"For this reason, I believe that the decision on financing the battle against climate change must take this factor into account and exclude the countries from the last accession rounds from paying certain taxes which would impose an excessive burden on these economies."
"At the moment, the European Council is devoting particular attention to the European Union's economic and financial situation."
"The global financial crisis has hit Europe's states, citizens and businesses extremely hard."
"As the situation regarding unemployment in Europe is expected to continue to deteriorate, an ongoing commitment must be made to dynamic labour market policies."
"The European Commission has forecast an unemployment rate of 10.25% across the 27 Member States."
"The Council and Commission must continue their efforts on devising recovery strategies in cooperation with the European Parliament and Member States by implementing the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"When setting deadlines for the governments to discontinue their anti-crisis strategies, the situation and commitments of each Member State must be taken into account separately."
"In Romania's case, the agreements with the European Union and International Monetary Fund are planned to cover 2009 and 2010."
"Consequently, any discontinuation of this financial support will disrupt the anti-crisis programme which Romania has launched."
"It is regrettable that the instability caused by blocking the parliamentary majority in Romania (PSD (Social Democratic Party) + PC (Conservative Party), PNL (National Liberal Party), UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania)) raises doubts over the receipt of the third tranche from the IMF."
"Following the negotiations at the European Council of 29 and 30 October and the decision of the Czech Constitutional Court of 3 November, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, has signed the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The treaty will now be able to enter into force, providing the institutions with a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and with a stable President of the Council for two and a half years."
"The structure of the new Commission, like the choice of figures who will occupy the posts of President of the Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, are crucial."
"The choice of President of the Council is crucial since it is he or she who will embody Europe for two and a half years."
"Moreover, at a time of globalisation and of power struggles between continents, the choice of High Representative for Foreign Affairs is of undeniable strategic importance."
"On 19 November, an extraordinary European Council will meet to negotiate the nominations."
"We are at a turning point in European history."
"The choices that you make, Heads of State or Government, will determine the Europe that you want in the future."
"Therefore, be ambitious, because Europe must be dynamic, proactive, effective and political if we want it to continue to progress."
"I welcome the firm commitment shown by the EU Heads of State or Government during the European Council last month to go on leading the fight against climate change."
"European leaders have endorsed the estimate that, by 2020, the total costs of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries could amount to around EUR 100 billion annually."
"The EU has strengthened its negotiating position by reaching an agreement on the funding required to help developing countries and, in particular, the poorest countries."
"However, I am concerned by the fact that no clear decision has been made on the EU's contribution and each Member State's share of the total burden, taking into account each country's ability to pay."
"For the Copenhagen conference to succeed, it is vital that a political agreement is reached that covers the most important points more amply, particularly with regard to the commitments to be taken on by all concerned."
"in writing. - Our European leaders failed yet again to break the deadlock in the negotiations for the conference in Copenhagen."
"Of course, this summit was spun in the media as a success when, in truth, we got nothing but waffle."
"Our European leaders had the chance to make a just and credible offer of financing to the developing world to cover the costs of climate change, which is affecting their countries the most, but which is caused by us in the developed world."
"This summit did not meet the standard set by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of this Parliament and by civil society around the world, which have called for no less than EUR 30 billion to be pledged by the EU and, crucially, for a firm commitment that this would be new and additional to existing overseas development aid."
"Copenhagen or no Copenhagen, climate change will be with us for decades to come."
"This is the biggest test so far of the 21st century."
"We must reach a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, and for that, we need from our European leaders real political courage and less of the waffle."
"At a time when Europe has finally managed to overcome the treaties crisis in which it was embroiled and the Treaty of Lisbon has, at last, been ratified by the 27 Member States, I welcome the fact that there is a new legal and institutional framework that will allow the way the Union functions to be tailored in line with its current size, through consolidating Parliament's powers and focusing specifically on the role of national parliaments in European integration."
"It is the moment we have been waiting for and, with the Treaty of Lisbon having been approved, it is an opportunity for the Union, now that it has its new institutional framework, to commit to the main tasks it will have to perform in the immediate future."
"At this point, I must point out the action that is expected from the European Union to combat the crisis, to stimulate the economy, to strengthen market confidence, with a particular emphasis on improving the level of unemployment in Europe."
"Now that we are seeing tentative signs of economic recovery, we must, then, focus our efforts on stimulating the European economy, paying special attention to the primary and secondary sectors - with a particular emphasis on agriculture - which have been badly affected by the crisis, and the creation of a European supervision structure."
"Once again, the main priority at this European Council was, regrettably, to adopt the conditions guaranteeing the entry into force of the so-called Treaty of Lisbon by the end of 2009, in other words, to adopt positions enabling swift ratification by the Czech Republic."
"The main concerns of the leaders of the European Union are the institutional issues that allow for quicker progress in the capitalist, federalist and militaristic integration of the European Union."
"Issues concerning the economic, financial and social crisis therefore took a back seat."
"Indeed, the little progress that was made is a result of great pressure from important sectors in several Member States, of which the milk crisis is an example."
"Even here, the Council only went as far as increasing the budget for 2010 by just EUR 280 million."
"However, the proposals just tabled by the European Commission following on from the Council's guidelines are very worrying, in terms of both the excess deficit and the announcement to raise the retirement age."
"Instead of a response to the serious social problems of poverty and unemployment, what they are proposing are measures that will exacerbate the social situation and the glaring inequalities that already exist."
"in writing. - The Council meeting was crucial for the European Union, for it cleared away the last obstacle to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"However, I warn all of us not to consider it as a result per se."
"We are only halfway: now we have to get used to the new institutional framework."
"When it comes to adaptation, the Parliament is well on track, as it has already worked on its Rules of Procedure and has debated the installation of new institutions, such as the European External Service."
"The next step is to set up a Commission which shows leadership and portrays our values."
"Therefore, I urge Member States to nominate competent, qualified people, and to make an effort to have a gender-balanced Commission."
"Equally, we need to choose the top leaders as soon as possible, and not to waste time."
"There is no time to be lame ducks."
"If we consider ourselves as a carrier of universal values, we need leaders now who are capable of representing them credibly - for example, in Copenhagen, where nations will be negotiating the near future of mankind, and Europe will need all its talent, responsibility and generosity to reach an agreement."
"First of all, I welcome the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the Czech Republic."
"The coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December and the new interinstitutional relations provided for by it will enable the European Union's representatives to manage more efficiently both the repercussions of the economic and financial crisis and negotiations in Copenhagen on combating climate change."
"The signs of economic recovery need not entail immediate withdrawal of the support policies as this could have an adverse effect on the economy in the long term."
"I also hope that Member States reach agreement on devising a coordinated strategy for withdrawing the incentive measures when the right moment arrives for this."
"We are also expecting a future agreement on a package of proposals for setting up a new financial supervisory structure for the European Union."
"Last but not least, we should not forget that Europe's citizens will now look even more towards a consolidated Europe and will expect the EU to improve the employment situation in the coming years."
"This is why European institutions must promote new dynamic labour market policies as soon as possible."
"I wish to express my support for the positions adopted by the European Commission and European Council highlighted in the documents presented."
"The Copenhagen conference is approaching and the EU must play a vital role in negotiating a comprehensive and ambitious global agreement for combating climate change."
"The European Council's conclusions mention the finances required, both at a global and European level, to combat the adverse effects of climate change, such as drought, fires and flooding, which result in so many victims and such great losses every year."
"I believe that the EU must provide financial support as consistently as possible for measures taken by Member States with regard to irrigation, building dams, forestation and encouraging the production of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, biofuels and hydro."
"We have also noticed a great need for financial support from the EU at local authority and private individual level where the necessary funds are not available for making buildings more energy efficient."
"The EU must continue to devote greater attention to this aspect so that citizens remain at the heart of European policies."
"What happened a few days ago at the summit of the European Council is outrageous and shakes all faith in the community of values so often emphasised by the EU."
"The EU wanted to make President Klaus sign at any price, even by indirectly giving its approval to historical injustice."
"On the basis of the Beneš Decrees, up to 1947 around 2.9 million people were declared enemies of the state and expelled purely on the basis of their nationality."
"As a result, around 230 000 people met a tragic death."
"The decrees do not judge people on the basis of specific crimes they have committed; the starting point is purely ethnic origin."
"Today, we would call this ethnic cleansing, something that should, in fact, be openly rejected by all of the Member States."
"From a legal point of view, the displaced people were denied the right to the presumption of innocence, a proper trial and appropriate compensation for expropriation."
"Felix Ermacora, professor of international law and former UN rapporteur, even came to the conclusion in his 1991 legal report that the expulsion was tantamount to genocide."
"In spite of all this, and without any objective justification, President Klaus was granted a derogation in order to ensure the non-application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, this 'footnote' will not enter into force until Iceland or Croatia ratifies the treaty."
"Claims for compensation could be made during this window of opportunity."
"The EU's unilateral action is not sufficient, even though it is at the forefront of the fight against climate change."
"It will not be possible to conclude a global agreement on reducing and adapting to the effects of climate change without the involvement of the developing countries, especially the most advanced among them."
"The effects of climate change are already having an impact on the development of these states: drought, flooding, natural disasters, desertification, with all the economic and social repercussions they entail."
"Any action to reduce the effects and adapt to the situation requires a robust mechanism to be in place for measuring, reporting on and verifying developments, along with a properly managed fund comprising public and private finances."
"These combined efforts will help achieve the targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, developing a sustainable economy and creating green jobs."
"Mr Barroso will soon be assigning portfolios to the new commissioners."
"I hope he will not make a glaring error, such as he did during the last parliamentary term, when he proposed as Commissioner for Justice a candidate with a 19th-century mentality, a Catholic fundamentalist, male chauvinist and homophobe."
"At the time, the European Parliament did not allow the Commission to be compromised in this way."
"I trust Parliament will not have to intervene again."
"In accordance with Mr Barroso's declarations, the portfolios should be allocated while maintaining the golden principle of balance."
"The Commission should be decidedly more social, and the Commissioners should be competent."
"Mr Barroso does not have to worry about re-election now, so he can concentrate his efforts on tackling the crisis and on the social aspects of his programme."
"To this end, it is essential to entrust the economic and social portfolios to Commissioners from our socialist political family."
"If the Commission is not balanced with respect to gender, it will be a sign that there is no true equality."
"It is high time for the continually unfulfilled ideal of the equality of women and men to be made a practical reality."
"It is men who have been elected to the highest positions in the European Union (President of the European Parliament and President of the European Commission)."
"This, unfortunately, is overt promotion of discrimination against women."
"It is time to change this, and to make EU law banning all discrimination a reality at last."
"It is time for women!"
"It will be easy to find suitable candidates among the 250 million dynamic, bold and strong female citizens of the European Union, and this includes female candidates for the positions of President of the European Council and High Representative for Common Foreign Policy."
"EU-Russia Summit on 18 November 2009 in Stockholm (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU-Russia Summit on 18 November 2009 in Stockholm."
"Madam President, as you just said, the summit between the EU and Russia will take place in Stockholm on 18 November."
"It is a good opportunity for the EU to evaluate relations between ourselves and Russia."
"I know that many Members here in Parliament are following developments in Russia very closely."
"I would therefore like to present the main issues that we intend to discuss during the summit, and I am sure that the Commissioner would like to add more details about the areas relating to the Commission's sphere of responsibility."
"In general, clearly we want to use the summit to develop the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia."
"We have a lot to gain from cooperation with Russia in all areas."
"We need Russia if we are to be able to deal with the global challenges effectively."
"However, we must also make it clear to Russia that our partnership must be based on respect for a common commitment and common values."
"That means respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The summit will give us the opportunity to exert pressure on Russia to fulfil its contractual obligations in these areas and in other areas, too."
"One of the most important issues will be climate change."
"The Council will emphasise the fact that close cooperation between the EU and Russia is important to enable us to achieve a result in Copenhagen."
"Russia should promise tangible and comparable reductions in its emissions of greenhouse gases, corresponding to the two-degree target that the G8 agreed on in L'Aquila."
"The energy issue is linked to this - it is a matter of energy efficiency and energy security."
"With regard to Russia's position as the EU's most important energy partner, the summit will give us the opportunity to emphasise the need to regain trust and transparency in relations between the EU and Russia in the area of energy."
"We will also express our disappointment over Russia's recent withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty."
"We hope that a stronger early warning mechanism will be established and approved at the summit."
"This should be accompanied by clear guarantees from Russia and separately from other relevant third countries that the transit or export of gas to the EU will not be reduced or stopped in the event of future energy disputes."
"We will, of course, discuss the economic and financial crisis."
"The Council would like an agreement at the summit on the need for continued, coordinated efforts as a response to the crisis and confirms that we will insist on our economies being open and on the necessity to avoid protectionist measures."
"The summit will also give us the chance to assess the progress made in our work relating to the four common spaces."
"We will use the opportunity to stress the importance of making progress in the areas where it is needed or where problems have arisen."
"Russia's change in position with regard to the World Trade Organisation has created a new situation that we are in the process of analysing."
"Delays in Russia's WTO accession will affect our bilateral relations, including with regard to the negotiations for a new agreement between the EU and Russia."
"We will reiterate our support for Russia's accession to the WTO, and this is important for Russia's integration in the world economy."
"In the meantime, we need to work on the remaining trade and economic problems, for example, the Siberian overflight fees, measures at the border that hamper the importation of commercial vehicles into Russia, the discriminatory road taxes, plans to limit the import of containers by road, export duties on timber and the protectionist measures Russia has recently taken."
"I am very well aware of the great concern that the European Parliament has about the human rights situation in Russia."
"Evidence of this can be seen, in particular, in your decision to award this year's Sakharov Prize to human rights defenders in Russia."
"The Swedish Presidency shares your concern and we will ensure that human rights issues will have a prominent place in discussions at the summit."
"Of course, we welcome President Medvedev's statement on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, but this must be followed by concrete actions."
"The human rights situation in Russia is disturbing."
"We will highlight, in particular, the most recent events in the North Caucasus, which has been the scene of violence against human rights defenders, crime prevention personnel, representatives of the authorities and the population at large."
"It is particularly worrying that human rights defenders and journalists have been killed, not only in the North Caucasus, but also in Russia as a whole."
"We will therefore reiterate our appeal to Russia to do its utmost to ensure that human rights defenders can carry out their work without having to live in fear of violence, harassment or threats."
"With regard to foreign policy and security issues, we will emphasise the importance of maintaining and improving the dialogue concerning the immediate vicinity that we share."
"We need to cooperate with Russia on this if we are to be able to make progress in achieving a peaceful solution to long drawn-out conflicts."
"Obviously, we will not deviate from our fundamental principles."
"We will raise the matter of Georgia and reiterate that Russia must fully honour its commitments under the six-point plan laid down on 12 August and, subsequently, the agreement of 8 September 2008."
"We must also regain the necessary trust with regard to Akhalgori, Upper Kodori and the checkpoint in Perevi."
"We will also call on Russia to use its influence to grant the EU Monitoring Mission access to the Georgian areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in accordance with its country-wide mandate."
"The summit will also give us the opportunity to assess progress made at the Geneva talks, and in this regard, we expect Russia to continue its committed approach."
"We realise that we need to cooperate with Russia with regard to the so-called frozen conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh."
"We will stress the importance of a continued commitment to the conflict settlement mechanisms, these being the Minsk Group and the '5+2' format in Transnistria."
"Russia's active commitment to promoting dialogue between the Armenian and the Azerbaijan presidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh matter is, of course, welcome."
"However, we will also point out to Russia the importance of involving the Minsk Group in all stages of the process."
"The EU is prepared to get involved in and support the Minsk Process, among other things, through measures to promote trust."
"The summit should express its support for the ratification and implementation of the new protocols between Armenia and Turkey."
"Other matters in this area relate to the Euro-Atlantic Security Partnership and the Eastern Partnership."
"With regard to Euro-Atlantic Security, we will urge Russia to take an active part in the Corfu Process prior to a forward-looking decision being taken in Athens."
"The summit should ask for Russia's confirmation that it supports the fundamental principles of the process, in other words, complete respect for and implementation of the regulations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), that the OSCE is the main forum for debate on the Corfu Process, and the fact that all aspects of the overarching security strategy should be dealt with in a balanced way."
"As far as the EU is concerned, we are willing to inform Russia of all incidents relating to the Eastern Partnership and reiterate that third countries may, on a case-by-case basis, be entitled to take part, in accordance with the joint declaration in Prague of May 2009."
"The summit will also allow us to raise a number of international and regional issues."
"I think it is extremely likely that issues such as Iran, Afghanistan/Pakistan, the South Caucasus and, of course, the Middle East will be raised."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I have talked for quite a long time, but I know that you are very committed to this matter."
"It is an important summit with a lot of items on the agenda and I look forward to hearing your views and suggestions when we make the final preparations ahead of this meeting."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, just a year ago, we reviewed EU-Russian relations and decided that the European Union should - despite our major differences with Russia over the conflict in Georgia - pursue cooperation with this major neighbour, including on the negotiation of the new agreement."
"We also concluded that we should base our relations on the assessment of our own self-interest."
"The Stockholm Summit next week will therefore focus on areas - as has been said already - where there is mutual interest, for example, climate change and energy, and the global economic crisis."
"The financial crisis has hit Russia hard, and this is precisely the kind of policy area in which the European Union also has a clear interest in seeking a common policy approach."
"The G20 commitments were an important step in the right direction."
"I think it is important that they are now upheld by all partners."
"It is crucial, too, that Russia does not succumb to the temptations of protectionism."
"A tendency to protectionist practices is already hurting EU businesses."
"Clearly, we believe that the best way forward is to work together in a rules-based multilateral format."
"The summit will be an opportunity to again stress the importance of Russia's WTO accession."
"Russia's intention to complete negotiations in parallel with Belarus and Kazakhstan, with which it is planning a customs union, still leaves many questions unanswered."
"At the same time, we hope to get a better understanding of Russia's new approach at the summit."
"This is important, not least in the context of the ongoing negotiations for the new agreement which are being held by the Commission and which must contain clear, legally binding provisions on trade and investment and also on energy."
"The summit should also provide definitive clarity as to the conditions concerning bilateral trade from 1 January 2010 onwards under the new common external tariff system of the customs union."
"Turning to climate change, my colleague has already said that the summit should underline the leading roles that Russia and the European Union can play together in achieving results at the Copenhagen meeting."
"Russia has the scope to make a very substantial contribution, given its enormous scope for emissions reductions through improvements in energy efficiency."
"We will therefore be calling on Russia to commit itself to more ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, comparable with the targets we have set ourselves in the EU."
"On energy security, work continues on an enhanced early warning mechanism."
"We regret Russia's withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), but we recall that the principles of the ECT were affirmed under Russia's presidency of the G8, for instance, in the St Petersburg Declaration."
"These should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new EU-Russia agreement."
"While we should be ready to discuss Russia's wish for a wider debate on international energy security architecture, I think we will also want, above all, to establish the essentials of our bilateral energy relationship."
"While we work well with Russia on many aspects of international relations, we need to make more progress in our cooperation in the common neighbourhood."
"We will therefore continue to explain our view that the political and economic stability encouraged by the Eastern Partnership is, finally, in the interests of all parties."
"We will continue to encourage Russia to work constructively for the resolution of the outstanding issues and conflicts, be they in Transnistria or Nagorno-Karabakh, and also through the Geneva process."
"President Medvedev's proposal for a wider discussion of Euro-Atlantic security has led to a new process of talks under the aegis of the OSCE."
"I think it is now important that this debate does not distract us from the immediate task of resolving today's frozen conflicts."
"The EU-Russia strategic partnership must - as was said before - be based on common commitments in the area of human rights and democracy."
"Russia has entered into commitments as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and these have to be upheld."
"I think it is also crucial that we go further and work together on all the different issues."
"We know that the relationship between Russia and the EU is complex, but full of opportunities, and also has a vast potential."
"We will therefore pursue our principled course of critical, but also constructive, engagement with our neighbour, confident that Russia, too, knows its interests lie in maintaining a real strategic partnership with us."
"Madam President, it is good that there is a regular summit between the EU and Russia, as there is, of course, a lot to discuss."
"Key topics on the comprehensive agenda include the planned cooperation agreement, securing the supply of energy, Russia's accession to the WTO, climate change, the situation in the Caucasus and, above all, the situation with regard to democracy and the rule of law in Russia."
"Disarmament, arms control and a possible anti-missile shield are also on the agenda."
"We also both face threats in the form of international terrorism and fundamentalism."
"A country like Iran is a challenge for both the EU and Russia."
"Both of us belong to the Middle East Quartet and, together with the US, are obliged to work towards a solution in this region."
"We hope that the conditions will soon be in place for visa-free travel between the EU and Russia."
"I am sure that unhindered interpersonal contact is the best way to give young Russians, in particular, a real picture of the life and ideas of Europeans and our intentions towards Russia."
"The prerequisite that will enable us to get through this agenda is, in my opinion, agreement within the EU and clarity in our message towards the outside world."
"Although it is a cliché, all too often we have experienced divisions amongst ourselves, or we have allowed ourselves to be divided, over nuances."
"In this regard, no EU government should believe that it can negotiate better in the long term alone on an equal footing with Russia than we can achieve through the combined weight of the EU."
"As a community of values, we have a common view of the situation with regard to the rule of law and human rights in Russia and we should say so."
"Unfortunately, we had to award the Sakharov Prize to a Russian organisation."
"My thanks to the Presidency for its clarity in this regard."
"As we are equally dependent on energy supplies, we need to ensure that the agreements in the three-way relationship between Russia, Ukraine and the EU are formulated in such a way as to prevent a drop in gas pressure in parts of the EU every winter."
"In the Caucasus, we must jointly demand unrestricted access for EU observers."
"As regards disarmament or the anti-missile shield, the EU must make its position clear to Russia and the US."
"If we achieve all of this, then Russia will take us seriously and we will co-exist well."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, debates on Russia very often divide us into ideologists and pragmatists, confrontational geo-strategists and conciliatorists, Cold War veterans and new utilitarian opportunists."
"I think that it is high time to move away from these dilemmatic Manichaeisms and to make clear points concerning our wish to engage in a constructive and efficient dialogue with Russia."
"As far as I am concerned, we should always show firmness from the strategic point of view, but flexibility from the tactical point of view, in our relations with Russia."
"We should always defend our values and interests, but we should also show empathy and respect for the aspirations and interests of Russia."
"This is the only basis on which we could develop confidence and mutual trust and find mutually efficient and acceptable solutions."
"On a more concrete point, we must transform our eastern neighbourhood from an area of rivalries into an area of common strategies and common projects."
"A common strategy for the Black Sea area should perhaps slowly complement our synergy and give more substance to our present approach."
"Within this context, we have to approach the issue of frozen conflicts in a very fair and open way and leave aside any taboos in trying to find solutions on a pragmatic basis."
"We must also help Russia to meet its objective need to avoid being trapped as a possible oil- and gas-dependent power, while we have to achieve our independence from an energy point of view."
"We have to look for something more imaginative in order to find true cooperation, technological cooperation and exploitation cooperation, opening the markets in the field of energy."
"We must look together with Russia to a new global security arrangement or agreement."
"I think that the Medvedev initiative should not be immediately rejected."
"Some think that there is an agenda behind this initiative which we cannot accept."
"Others think that there is no agenda and it is a mere test of our reactions."
"Whatever is behind it, our current security arrangements are rooted in different times and we have to update them."
"We have to see what is still valid and we have to add something new to them."
"My last point is that we have to take advantage of the new transatlantic relations in order to perhaps achieve a trilateral Russia-United States-Europe dialogue."
"We also have to think of such a trilateral approach in order at least to be sure that Russia and the United States will not cut deals without our participation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to stress clearly that good neighbourly and mutually beneficial relations between the European Union and Russia are very important."
"However, such relations require good will on both sides, something that President Havel indeed referred to today in his afternoon speech."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that Russia has always valued strong partners highly. And today's preparation for the summit taking place in a week's time actually shows, as far as the European Union is concerned, that if we want to, we can speak with one voice."
"And this is very important - as is indeed shown by the resolution we have prepared - and in listening therefore to the council and the representatives of the Commission, I have a very good feeling about this."
"Also, the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, needless to say, creates a larger and wider basis for this."
"Now, though, let us look at this from the point of view of Russia."
"Actually, Russia has a very good opportunity next week to show a sincere desire to cooperate with us, whether in areas such as energy security or the preparation of a new framework agreement between the European Union and Russia, or, for example, guidelines for behaviour and thought on Russia's part in moving towards the WTO."
"It is true that at the moment, there are some ambivalent attitudes: President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin have given out different signals."
"I very much hope that next week, the European Union will gain some clarity on what kind of course Russia will therefore take towards the WTO."
"And certainly the European Union, I think, must support Russia in its movement towards the WTO."
"Certainly, however, a very important issue on which Russia can demonstrate its cooperation with us is in cooperating and reaching an agreement on the area of climate change."
"This is something very concrete, and it is taking place very soon - in December at the Copenhagen Summit - and this is truly a matter where we should be able to weigh everything up and look at whether this cooperation between the European Union and Russia is therefore possible or not."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it has very frequently been said over the past year that relations between the European Union and Russia should be made more pragmatic, and already I myself have heard people question this point: whether therefore, the European Union is just throwing aside human rights, basic values and the subject of democracy."
"I think that on no account should we do this, because if we did, then we would devalue ourselves completely, as well as the European Union as a whole."
"And bringing up human rights is not in any way to persecute Russia, push them into the corner or lecture them; bringing up human rights is, first and foremost, about looking after the people living in Russia; that is, protecting ordinary citizens."
"And black clouds in the area of human rights are actually coming to Moscow once more, because - as you heard yesterday - the constitutional court has discussed the possible reinstatement of the death penalty from next year, and for liberals this is definitely a very tough subject."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot say more on this subject here, but certainly as far as the conflicts are concerned, we intend to bring them up for discussion and we should definitely discuss them."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, we are not only celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall and the peaceful revolution, but 1989 was also the year that saw the death of Andrei Sakharov, who played a significant part in the fall of the totalitarian Eastern Bloc system."
"Andrei Sakharov also left us the advice that his country needs understanding and pressure - emphatic pressure."
"However, I would not translate the word davlenie as pressure these days, but rather as emphatic support and, indeed, emphatic support in all areas where Russia is moving towards modernisation and where the signs of a social market economy, democracy and the rule of law are beginning to emerge."
"Russia's President Medvedev recently expressed his concern about the stagnation and problems in his country and called for support for his efforts to bring about reform."
"That is something we should provide, if it is a genuine request."
"This includes the involvement of Russia in international regulatory frameworks like the WTO and the Energy Charter."
"For that reason, we must not create any unnecessary obstacles."
"Russia also needs to acknowledge that it cannot deal with this crisis on its own."
"However, as Václav Havel said earlier today, partnership also requires us to tell each other the whole truth."
"I would therefore like to say this: where elections are falsified, even the concept of steered democracy begins to create cynicism, and therefore the monitoring of elections is extremely important."
"Where critical journalists are murdered, the truth also dies."
"We are not making any progress with our 'change through trade' approach."
"Instead, we must place our relationship with Russia on a firm basis of values."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, the ECR Group accepts that Russia is a vital economic partner and a global diplomatic heavyweight, but this position brings with it responsibilities."
"The first such responsibility is to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbours such as Ukraine and Georgia and abandon the insulting 'near abroad' concept."
"Russia must also take concrete steps to protect human rights and the rule of law, given the number of unsolved murders of journalists and human rights activists."
"The Sakharov Prize awarded to the human rights group Memorial shows just how seriously we in this Parliament view this issue."
"Russia must also cooperate in the prevention of nuclear proliferation, particularly to Iran, and not sell Iran the S300 missile system to demonstrate solidarity with the west against this dangerous regime."
"The rising nostalgia for the Soviet Union and Stalin is also very worrying."
"Finally, as winter approaches, Russia cannot be permitted once again to use its virtual monopoly of gas supplies to Europe as a diplomatic weapon."
"The EU's commitment to diversification of source and supply under a common external energy security policy must surely strengthen our hand at the negotiating table with Russia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot imagine that EU representatives guided by a resolution drafted by the European Parliament will manage to achieve a result in Stockholm."
"If the Russian delegation has a similar recommendation, the summit is doomed to failure."
"Do we want the negotiations to assist cooperation between the EU and Russia?"
"Of course we do."
"Russia is often described in the document as a key partner of the EU."
"However, almost everything is expressed in terms of demands and conditions rather than proposals."
"For example, responsibility for the success of the climate conference in Copenhagen is placed on Russia."
"It was Russia, nonetheless, that rescued the Kyoto Protocol, while the US refused to ratify it."
"At the same time, the unrealistic positions adopted in relation to Russia include the task of sorting out media freedom."
"The situation is definitely not ideal. At the same time, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of Italy, we decided during the last plenary session that this was an internal matter."
"Italy happens to be a Member State of the Union. So what are we hoping to achieve in Russia?"
"If Russia is supposed to be an important partner, let us negotiate with her on that basis."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be abstaining from the vote on this motion for a resolution because I find it somewhat contradictory."
"It is, in fact, acknowledged within the resolution that economic cooperation between Russia and Europe has vastly improved over the last 10 years."
"It is recognised that Russia has strengthened relations in the areas of energy, trade, visa liberalisation, illegal immigration control, the fight against terrorism, climate change and foreign policy, and on issues such as Iranian nuclear weaponry, and peacemaking in the Caucasus and the Middle East."
"While we call for all these things, in the same resolution we strongly criticise Russia's domestic situation."
"There is a general feeling of aversion towards and mistrust of Russia that does not represent a sound basis for the cooperation that we are calling for."
"This does not mean we should close our eyes to the democratic and human rights situation in that country, but I believe that support and trust are needed more than criticism at the moment, precisely in order to improve the human rights situation in Russia."
"(HU) While on the subject of EU-Russian relations, I must also mention today's formal sitting."
"It is indeed 20 years ago that the Berlin Wall collapsed, putting an end to Soviet Communist dictatorship."
"Hungarians were among the greatest victims of this dictatorship."
"I must mention two additional facts."
"First of all, the status quo was able to continue for decades because the Western powers also wanted to maintain this situation after the Second World War."
"Secondly, the Soviet Union did not equate even then with the Russian people, who also suffered from Communist dictatorship."
"Russia is obviously our extremely important economic and strategic partner."
"The European Union speaks out against human rights violations."
"It is indeed right to do so."
"However, does it have the moral basis for doing this after it acquired Václav Klaus's signature on the Treaty of Lisbon by letting the Beneš Decrees continue to apply, thereby accepting that as a consequence, certain peoples are considered collectively guilty?"
"At the last sitting, we discussed the US-EU Summit."
"The general drift of the debate was: what do we need to do to be accepted as the United States' good partner?"
"However, the mood I am now sensing here is: what conditions will we impose on Russia so that we can accept it as a reliable partner?"
"I believe that we must look to establish much more balanced cooperation with both these partners, if this is what we consider they are."
"(PL) Madam President, the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit will confirm the importance which the European Union attaches to relations with Russia."
"In this context, I would like to draw attention to two questions which are fundamental from the point of view of the interests of Russia and the European Union."
"These questions influence those relations and, in fact, define them."
"I refer to the problems of cooperation in the areas of energy and security."
"If the European Union and Russia are to achieve success together, and that is surely our aim, we must state our point of view very clearly."
"Our Russian partners do this in an accomplished manner, without ambiguity, because ambiguity causes misunderstandings."
"It is important that the European Union construct its point of view in exactly this manner."
"The agreement reached by the largest political groups in the European Parliament on a joint and, indeed, very good motion for a resolution is a step which I value highly."
"However, I think it could be even better if we included a third amendment stressing the importance of EU-Russian cooperation in the area of energy, but also showing the basis on which such cooperation should take place."
"This means that, especially at a time of economic and financial crisis, this cooperation should be based on keeping the financial costs to a minimum, but also that all conditions related to the supply of energy should be stated."
"The final matter concerns security."
"I would like to say a few words about the proposal of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), for a debate to be held on the subject of the Russian-Belarussian military exercises which assumed the need to repel a potential attack from Western Europe, from the territory of countries belonging to the European Union and NATO."
"It was with great regret that I received information that this debate had not found a place on the order of business and would not be the subject of discussion."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already clearly highlighted many points and problems, such as the human rights situation."
"It is important for us to make these points clearly, as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate."
"If Russia is currently once again seriously discussing introducing the death penalty according to the US model, we cannot neglect to express our opinion on this."
"I have two brief points to make."
"My first point relates to Russia's accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this."
"Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction."
"The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction."
"My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society."
"We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions."
"Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations."
"I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance."
"(FI) Madam President, I want to mention three matters very briefly."
"Russia would do well to understand that it must become a state subject to the rule of law."
"It is very difficult to see how Russia could develop as an economy or as a society before it has an independent judiciary."
"It is impossible to imagine that foreign companies could feel that it is safe to invest in the country if there is no independent judiciary there."
"Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of persuading Russia to commit to international rules."
"In the European Council, we have a problem in that Russia has not yet ratified Protocol 14, which would boost the effectiveness of the European Court of Human Rights."
"We in the Baltic Sea region also want Russia to accede to the Espoo Convention on the assessment of the environmental impact of international projects."
"Thirdly, human rights are important in themselves."
"I was very encouraged when Mrs Malmström said that the intention now was to raise issues of human rights at the summit."
"Please take along the results of the human rights dialogue and, furthermore, do it very publicly."
"(PL) Madam President, the EU-Russia Summit takes place in a week's time."
"I want to speak about this on a day which is of particular importance for my country, the day when Poland regained its independence."
"The independence not only of Poland, but also of other countries in the region, has always been threatened by Soviet, and then by Russian, imperialism."
"Today, we want to feel safe at last in the structures of a Europe of free nations, and so all the more we must not fail to see how Russia is trying to rebuild its empire, and that it has never come to terms with the loss of that empire."
"This is why Russia attacked Georgia."
"This is why it is carrying out what is, to all intents and purposes, the Anschluss of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, why it is threatening Ukraine, why it is interfering in the anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, and why it uses its energy resources in a form of blackmail."
"This is why there is something both symbolic and sinister in the fact that just before the EU-Russia Summit, the country which currently has the Presidency of the European Union and is hosting the summit - Sweden - has withdrawn its ecological veto of the Nord Stream project."
"Nord Stream does not make any economic sense, and its sole objective is to cancel in practice the principle of energy solidarity, which was supposed to be one of the main principles and ideals of the Lisbon Treaty."
"In the words of a phrase which is popular in my country, I call upon the old countries of the EU: do not go that way!"
"Do not do deals with Russia which are politically motivated against the new Member States, because this threatens to wreck the idea of a common Europe."
"(DA) Madam President, in Russia, there is freedom of the press in name only, not in practice."
"Critical journalists are intimidated, persecuted and murdered."
"Russia is ranked 153 in the worldwide press freedom index - in other words, press freedom in Russia is now worse than in Belarus, Sudan and Zimbabwe."
"Should this really be rewarded?"
"Yet it does not stop there."
"We have the issue of gas supplies to European citizens."
"Again this year, we are seeing Russia threatening to disrupt gas supplies and there are indications that we will need to prepare for this possibility every winter in future."
"Yet can it really be right that we reward Russia for this?"
"I would like to suggest to the Council and the Commission that, instead of merely talking nicely to the Russians, it might be appropriate to speak out and say that this quite simply is not acceptable."
"What do you actually intend to do about the negative developments in the relationship between Russia and the EU?"
"Or do you merely intend to let things carry on as they are?"
"Do you actually want to reward this negative development?"
"Madam President, there is endless rhetoric here about friendship and cooperation between every state under the sun except for Russia."
"China commits genocide in Tibet."
"Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust."
"The USA flattens Iraq and this place fawns on them."
"But for Russia, there are only pompous and hypocritical lectures."
"This confrontational Russia phobia shamefully feeds the new Cold War drive of America's warmongering neo-con lobby."
"Of course, there are some local differences between Russia and her neighbours, but can we not agree that next week's summit should be used to attempt to build bridges and cooperation between the eastern and western halves of our civilisation?"
"For historical and cultural reasons, this is far more practical and safer than attempting to create unity with Turkey, Europe's ancient and eternal enemy."
"(ES) Madam President, relations with Russia are very important: it is a permanent member of the Security Council and a military power; its cooperation is necessary in order to tackle the nuclear challenge of Iran, the issue of the Middle East, disarmament, climate change, etc."
"Moreover, Russia is a neighbouring country of Europe with which many EU Member States have significant economic relationships and high levels of energy dependence."
"It is a country with which we have two regular annual summits (which certainly provide a good opportunity at which to evaluate the state of the relationship)."
"Now we are negotiating a new partnership agreement, which would increase cooperation in the so-called four 'common spaces'."
"In my view, the most important of these spaces is the economic and energy space: we need openness, clear rules, guarantees for investments, and Russia first of all needs to join the WTO."
"Next week's summit should therefore be an opportunity to clarify Russia's intentions with regard to the WTO and to ensure it does not take initiatives that are incompatible with it."
"In addition, the gas supply crisis of recent years should not be allowed to recur and the new agreement must include the principles of the European Energy Charter which, as has already been said, is the treaty from which Moscow has unfortunately withdrawn."
"We must continue to work on the other three spaces as well."
"I have already mentioned the importance of Russia as a global player."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can do many things together with Russia, but, as has also been said, there is one aspect of the relationship that we should not forget, since Russia is a European country and a neighbour. That is the need for it to respect human rights and the obligations that its membership of the Council of Europe imposes upon it in that regard."
"One of the most obvious failures of the EU's external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia."
"With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be simpler to create this common policy, but it is also necessary for us, as Member States, to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow, which are, at times, openly divergent from each other."
"(BG) Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mrs Malmström, I cannot begin my speech without mentioning that today, we marked in this Chamber 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"It seemed somehow that special emphasis was placed on what we have achieved during all these years, the fact that Europe has become united, thanks to the changes from twenty years ago, and that somehow one country had no involvement which, if we have to be honest, could have stopped these changes if it had wanted, in other words, the Soviet Union."
"I am saying this because, in my view, these changes became possible precisely because the West initiated a policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union."
"Without making a parallel between the Soviet Union and present-day Russia, I want to say that what I heard from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mrs Malmström is gratifying because it continues this policy of pragmatic partnership with Russia, highlighting that there are issues where the European Union cannot achieve success without the involvement of Russia."
"I would like to stress, of course, that we are certainly concerned about the human rights situation and about other matters, such as the fact that, according to Amnesty International's assessment, the situation is changing for the worse: local elections have been rigged and there are problems with how civil organisations operate."
"At any rate, we must be united in our approach to Russia."
"This is the conclusion which we must draw from recent years."
"I also want to say that one of the issues missing from the resolution which our Parliament is proposing is the Eastern Partnership."
"I would like specific attention to be devoted to the issue of the Eastern Partnership at the forthcoming summit meeting because this is the only way in which we can guarantee success for this new policy of ours."
"(PL) Madam President, Russia deserves to be treated seriously."
"I think that if our partners in the Kremlin were listening to the Commissioner's speech, they would be very surprised by her evaluation of EU-Russia relations."
"Our approach to the next EU-Russia Summit lacks the courage and sincerity required for a serious treatment of the fundamental questions which today stand between the EU and Russia."
"If there is no sincerity within the EU, if, only a few days after final ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in the Czech Republic, words about energy solidarity have no meaning, and further steps are taken towards building the northern gas pipeline; if, in our relations, there is no serious treatment of the Energy Charter or the Sarkozy Plan, or of the recent Russian military manoeuvres on Poland's eastern border, we will not achieve anything."
"I would like to hear something from the Commissioner, and please tell us sincerely: which elements of EU-Russia relations do you consider to be your personal success?"
"Where do we have the opportunity for success in this area?"
"Without sincerity, we will not build anything."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the war in Georgia, the gas dispute and the inability of the European Union to agree on a reasonably unified line to take with regard to Russia have left their mark."
"At the same time, Russia is, without a doubt, an important strategic partner for Europe, and not only in terms of energy supply."
"We will soon see whether the new memorandum to prevent energy crises and the European early warning system are worth the paper they are written on - at least we will when the next gas dispute arises."
"The fact is that our dependence on Russian gas cannot be eliminated easily and even the Nabucco project will barely make a difference to this situation."
"It would be naive to believe that Tehran would not be able to put pressure on Europe."
"I believe that the European Union must pursue a sensible and realistic policy towards Russia."
"It needs to find the balance between European and Russian interests and also show respect for Russia's historical sensitivities with regard to geopolitical matters."
"Otherwise, we may soon not only have to worry about a bilateral ice age, but also about citizens freezing in Europe on account of the gas dispute."
"(LT) I support Mr Zalewski's position, to be precise, Amendment No 1, since it draws serious attention to two questions that are crucial for the European Union."
"Firstly, we do not approve of the way the third country arrogantly ignores and rejects the EU as its equal and respected partner in matters of external energy security that are important to the European Union."
"Secondly, we do not approve of the anti-European dividing line, which of course, the third country is implementing in the 'Nord Stream' gas pipeline project."
"We must oppose the lobbyist and, at times, corrupt division of Europe, and must not condone Russia's arrogance towards us, by which I mean the European Parliament."
"We cannot allow Gazprom - the principal 'Nord Stream' shareholder - to completely ignore our Parliament's resolution on the threats the gas pipeline poses to the environment."
"The problem is not simply the tragic ecological state of the Baltic Sea, but also our institution's moral condition."
"When we voted here last year, we demanded that an evaluation of the impact on the environment be carried out, one that is independent and not bought in advance, and that guarantees be given to nations on the shores of the Baltic should there be a disaster."
"Gazprom did not even bother to answer Europe."
"That is like spitting in Parliament's face and we cannot respond by saying 'Yes, sir, great pleasure'."
"We must behave with dignity and honour without manipulating or blocking the special debates currently initiated by MEPs on problems concerning Baltic Sea life."
"If, struck by fear, we agree to the murdering of the Baltic and a new Moscow-Berlin border in the sea with Russian Naval vessels protecting the pipeline, we will bury our free future."
"Indeed, while chatting about energy, we are selling our future."
"(DE) Madam President, indeed, we must take Russia seriously, as Mr Kowal said, in particular, after the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, with regard to which it is interesting that the President who long refused to sign the treaty, Václav Klaus, has taken a particularly uncritical stance towards Russia."
"Taking Russia seriously means developing a sensible relationship and a pragmatic economic relationship with Russia, but it does not mean that we should not be critical of political developments within Russia, particularly with regard to human rights issues."
"It was with great regret that we discovered what happened during the last elections, that things were clearly not quite as they should have been."
"We are, of course, particularly concerned about the attacks on human rights defenders."
"I do not want to lay the blame for these attacks at the door of the Russian Government."
"What I do want, and what we demand in this resolution, which is a very balanced one, is for Russia to take the protection of these human rights defenders seriously."
"That is not happening, at least not to a sufficient degree."
"In this regard, we should focus more on President Medvedev than Prime Minister Putin."
"The differences may not be very large, but if either has taken a reasonably enlightened, positive stance, it is surely President Medvedev, and we should strengthen and support him in that."
"As regards the energy issue: here, too, we need to cultivate a very calm, reasonable relationship."
"I have nothing against Nord Stream, or against South Stream, but I do not want to be dependent on anyone, not on any one country, for our gas supply."
"I am therefore very much in favour of the Nabucco pipeline."
"Multiplicity, diversification - that is the crucial factor in gas supply connection, whether it comes via a different pipeline, like Nabucco, or via LNG ports."
"This is not because the country in question is Russia, but because Europe should not be dependent on anyone."
"If we now bring Ukraine into the mix, I would like to see Ukrainian politicians accepting their full responsibility and making the investments that have been agreed with Europe."
"I know that Russia often exploits the situation, but if Ukraine fulfils its promises, then Russia will not be able to exploit the situation, because the investments in question will have been made in Ukraine."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate the authors of the resolution for harmonising the points of view of the various political groups."
"The Stockholm Summit offers a good opportunity to demonstrate to our Member States that we can be united."
"Although we speak 23 languages, we can express ourselves with a single voice when it comes to defending our economic, political and energy interests."
"The European Union must devote particular attention to energy security, both by ensuring constant supplies from Russia and by developing alternative projects, such as Nabucco and the pan-European Constanţa - Trieste oil pipeline."
"For us Romanians, energy security means security in the Black Sea region."
"Europe's energy policy may be affected by unresolved conflicts in this region."
"At the same time, we need to replace the mindset based on spheres of influence with one based on spheres of trust."
"Russia must cooperate with the European Union in this region of maximum interest."
"The progress of certain projects of vital interest to the European Union's development also depends on energy security."
"(HU) Madam President, we greatly need to establish a new partnership and cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"However, this is currently being restricted by an historical debate between several EU Member States and Russia."
"Relations between the European Union and Russia cannot be held hostage to these historical debates."
"We are mutually dependent in the energy sector, as was also mentioned by Hannes Swoboda."
"In the energy sector, it would be an important development for the European Union and Russia to reach agreement after withdrawing from the Energy Charter."
"It would also be important in terms of setting up an energy hotline, so that the Central European Member States do not suffer the fallout from the arguments between Russia and Ukraine."
"Finally, we are fully entitled to condemn the violation of the rule of law and human rights in Russia."
"However, attention must also be drawn to those rights violations such as the denial of citizenship to 400 000 Russians living in Latvia, highlighting that the European Union still has plenty to do in its own backyard."
"(SL) I support the approach taken by Mrs Malmström and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"With such an agenda in place, I think that the dialogue between Russia and the European Union will prove to be advantageous to both parties."
"It has been a solemn day for us here today: we have commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"However, what we failed to recall is that, at the same time, another important wall collapsed in Russia, and that the process of transition, which is still in progress, began."
"Today, Russia is a better country than it was before the fall of the Berlin Wall and sometimes we need to remind ourselves of that."
"Sometimes we should give Russia, our important partner, credit for that and not allow ourselves to be carried away solely by the emotions aroused by our own history."
"We need Russia as a global partner in world politics and as a partner in relations between the European Union and Russia."
"However, this does not mean, as other members have suggested, us abandoning our fundamental values."
"I have no time for that kind of talk."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like, above all, to say something to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"You may not have been present this afternoon, when President Havel spoke."
"Like Mrs Ojuland and Mr Schulz, I would like to refer to President Havel's statement about the European Union's obligation to spread democracy and respect for human rights."
"Mrs Malmström also referred to this, for which I thank her."
"You spoke as if the European Union were preparing for a summit with Switzerland."
"You spoke about trade, about business, about the climate package, and completely forgot about significant matters, about what is perhaps most significant for the European Union."
"My wish for you, for us and, above all, for the citizens of the Russian Federation, is that the EU will more often present the position outlined today by Mrs Malmström rather than the one you presented."
"Madam President, before we criticise Russia for human rights abuses, we should look at similar abuses even within the European Union: countries in which opposition parties are physically attacked, such as Hungary, or attacked by the militia of the ruling party, such as even the United Kingdom, or countries that lock people up for non-violent dissent or ban political parties, like Belgium."
"We must conduct relations with Russia on the basis of the interests of our own Member States and not on hypocritical outbursts."
"Madam President, thank you for a very constructive debate."
"I think that most of us agree that Russia is a strategic partner for the EU and that our relations with this country are important."
"It needs to be a partnership based on respect for one another, for our common commitments and also for the values that the European Union stands for when it comes to human rights, democracy and the principle of the rule of law."
"In this regard, we need to be very clear and I believe that those who have criticised me, Mrs Rosbach for example, probably did not listen to my introductory speech, because I said very clearly then that we are concerned about developments in relation to human rights in Russia."
"Russia is an important neighbour."
"We do, of course, have many unresolved issues and perhaps none of us believes that we will resolve all of the issues at the summit in Stockholm."
"However, it is a valuable opportunity to meet and to talk."
"We have common issues in which we will perhaps be able to get a little closer to a solution."
"There is the question of the Middle East and Afghanistan, and at the moment, of course, the climate summit in Copenhagen is very relevant."
"Then there is the financial and economic crisis and our common commitments in this regard, as well as our relations with regard to energy, accession to the WTO and various issues relating to foreign and security policy."
"We need to cooperate with regard to conflict settlement in our common space."
"It is about identifying specific issues where both parties will benefit from cooperation."
"We must do this in a correct and respectful way, without abandoning our values."
"I hope that the summit will also help to strengthen our strategic partnership and open the way for constructive cooperation between us."
"That would be a positive thing."
"I have read the resolution that many of you referred to and that I understand you will vote on tomorrow."
"I think it is an extremely good resolution and I also think it is excellent that there is, on the whole, a high level of consensus in the Commission, as well as in the Council and the European Parliament, on these matters."
"Like so many of you have said, we need to speak with one voice when we talk to Russia."
"If we are in agreement, and if we have a clear and constructive dialogue, it will be good for Russia, it will be good for the EU and it will be good for many pertinent issues in the European and the global arena."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Russia is a strategic partner on the one hand but also a neighbour, and as a neighbour, it is more complicated."
"However, especially at a time of economic uncertainty, I think it is all the more important to ensure that the relationship between Europe and Russia works as effectively as possible to deliver security, stability and prosperity for our citizens and also for Russia's citizens."
"We must therefore redouble our efforts to find common ground on issues where our views differ - for instance on human rights questions or on questions on the common neighbourhood - but also to keep the door open for dialogue and debate that respects our differences but also respects our common commitments."
"This is, so to say, the general line."
"Now let me say a few very specific things."
"Russia's WTO accession is, and remains, a key objective for us."
"In so saying, it is time to resolve several issues that remain outstanding in this trade relationship."
"Some of these, such as the Transnistrian overflight charges, have been on our agenda for many years."
"They have always been mentioned at the many summits I have been on."
"Others, such as the proposed decree limiting the transport of containers by road, are more recent, and I personally - and all the Commission services - raise these issues whenever we talk to Russia."
"Indeed, we just had a permanent partnership council, but of course, we could again do so."
"The second item I want to mention is energy."
"The European Union and Russia are, as I said, also important partners in the energy field."
"The relation is one of interdependence, which offers both sides a strong motivation to put our energy relations on a predictable and also on a concrete basis."
"Ensuring an unhindered and uninterrupted energy supply to the European Union, thus preventing and overcoming emergency situations, is therefore of the utmost importance."
"This is what we aim to achieve with, for instance, the Early Warning Mechanism on which we are working and where it is important that we work with the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation."
"We have discussed this issue and I do hope that we can move on."
"On Ukraine and, especially, the transit of gas, we at the Commission have been working with the Ukrainian authorities, but also with the international financial institutions, on a loan package that would address both payment difficulties for the storage of gas from Russia and the reform and modernisation of the Ukrainian gas sector."
"An agreement was reached at the end of July, thus paving the way for financial assistance by the international financial institutions based on the implementation of a number of conditionalities."
"We hope that it will really work, and we also have to make sure that there is a very clear and transparent legal basis for the energy relationship."
"This is what we are aiming for, particularly in our new agreement."
"With regard to human rights, I did speak about human rights."
"We have spoken about human rights whenever we have been at the summit."
"I would like to say a few words on the death penalty, because this is, of course, not acceptable for us according to our community of values."
"Yes, the constitutional court in Russia is debating this issue at the moment, but we were told that there are indications that the court will conclude that Russia is bound by its signature of Protocol 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and thus, will most probably not apply the death penalty."
"Let us hope that this will indeed be true."
"As I mentioned before, Russia itself has, as a member of the UN, as a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, entered into very important commitments on human rights."
"These are always discussed in our EU-Russia human rights consultations."
"As these just took place in Stockholm on 5 November, I did not go into any details, but everybody who is informed knows about that."
"My last point is indeed a positive one: youth cooperation in science and technology."
"Yes, as Mr Fleckenstein mentioned, stimulating exchanges and cooperation between young people from the European Union and from Russia is a key concern for us and we are making our programmes available for this purpose."
"These have proven beneficial within the European Union itself, for instance, TEMPUS and Erasmus Mundus, and this is also an avenue we should continue to explore."
"In this context again, we are launching the negotiation of Russia's association to the European Community Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development."
"That is also an area of enormous economic potential."
"I think again that the scope of our relationship is enormous."
"There is a lot to be discussed and we do not always see eye to eye with Russia, but we can always debate on every issue, and this is what we do."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 12 November 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the onset of winter, Europe is being threatened by a gas crisis similar to that at the start of this year when dependency on Russian gas was more apparent than ever."
"There is likely to be a repeat this year too of the scenario which unfolded last winter, which Prime Minister Putin recently drew attention to, again based on a misunderstanding with Ukraine."
"In this context, the alternative to Russian gas, the Nabucco project, becomes an absolute necessity."
"Gas supplies to Europe cannot depend on conflicts between Russia and Ukraine."
"It is becoming imperative for all EU organisations to make Nabucco a priority, just as the European Council also actually decided in March."
"The EU must speak with a single voice on the Nabucco project."
"It is in Russia's interest to have access to Caspian gas, and a resolute, united front from Europe would bring Russia to the same negotiating table."
"We are not getting involved with competition between projects."
"We are not talking about Nord Stream versus South Stream."
"What we are talking about is the shared interest in ensuring an alternative source of gas."
"Last but not least, European institutions must make a strong appeal to Russia and Ukraine not to let feelings of pride dictated by geopolitical or electoral interests affect the security of the EU's population and economies."
"in writing. - (HU) The renegotiation of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides a good opportunity for both sides to review the issues which most clearly define their relations."
"In the wake of the events of the last few years, it is no coincidence that the agenda for the negotiations reflects the growing role of energy exchanges."
"Judging from the press, we can by no means be sure that this year we will escape the gas crisis, which is becoming a regular fixture."
"The EU Gas Supply Directive, which has not yet been adopted, will not be worth anything, unfortunately, if EU Member States once again wake up to shut-off taps."
"This is precisely why the EU must endeavour to make the basic principles of the Energy Charter, still to be ratified by Russia, an integral part of the new cooperation agreement."
"At present, both the issue of energy transit and market accessibility are fraught with contradictions."
"Indeed, as long as Russia, taking advantage of the market's openness, is still involved as an investor in most EU Member States, it will consistently close off its own market to Western companies."
"The Energy Charter may resolve this contradiction."
"Recording market principles in writing may provide a good basis during the negotiation of future long-term gas supply contracts as well."
"If they fail to establish transparent relations, it will still be possible to play off Member States against one another in the future as they continue to pay different prices for gas supplies."
"in writing. - Madam President, in Russia today, we are seeing the harassment of civil society by the authorities."
"Organisations whose sole role is to help protect basic civic freedoms and human rights are being driven out by eviction notices, refusal of administrative permits and, in some places in Russia, the murder of their members."
"We have just this week read reports that the For Human Rights centre, and the Moscow Helsinki Group, the oldest human rights organisation in Russia, are to be expelled from their premises."
"As we, the European Parliament, are about to present this year's Sakharov Prize to the 'Memorial' Foundation, including to one of the founders of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Mrs Lyudmila Mikhailovna Alexeyeva, we must underline that this Parliament, this Union, is more than just about business and making sure that gas arrives as cheaply as possible."
"We are a union of values, including those of civil liberties, democracy, human rights and human dignity."
"Next week, our European leaders during the summit need to speak about more than pipelines and free trade."
"It is not yet time to let the candle of Russian civil society burn out. Thank you"
"It is very important for us to have good relations and a good partnership with Russia."
"At the same time, efforts are being made at developing the Eastern Partnership, which aims to activate EU relations with Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia."
"Despite the many declarations made by the European Union and by Poland about cooperation with the Russian Federation, my concern is aroused by the fact that in September, thousands of Russian soldiers took part in military exercises named 'West 2009' in Belarus."
"The objective of these exercises was to put down a fictitious rising of the Polish ethnic minority."
"The holding of joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises on the assumption that the aggressor is one of the Member States of the European Union is extremely disturbing."
"In addition, it surprises me that there has been no reaction to this from the European Commission or from the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I hope this subject will be raised during the forthcoming European Union-Russia Summit, which will be held in Stockholm on 18 November."
"Implementation of the Services Directive (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Council on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Heide Rühle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0216/2009), and"
"the oral question to the Commission on implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Heide Rühle, Adam Bielan, Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Matteo Salvini, on behalf of the IMCO Committee - B7-0219/2009)."
"author. - Madam President, it is a privilege to be able to make my first intervention in the Chamber since being elected as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and to present this question on behalf of all the political groups on the committee as well as the coordinators."
"I am very pleased that many new members of the committee are here tonight to support me and to contribute to the debate."
"I do not think that this House needs any reminding about the importance of the Services Directive."
"In unleashing the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the European economy, the jobs that it will create, and the dynamic effect of that, are sorely needed at the moment in the stagnant conditions that we face."
"This is a very wide-ranging directive."
"It has many new features."
"It is complicated in many areas."
"It has needed a lot of attention."
"The transposition of this, in a consistent and full way, is absolutely vital for its effective operation."
"At the very core of this directive is the fact that Member States will remove barriers to business and, in particular, measures in their own national legislation that discriminate against service companies who want to do business."
"Believe me, there are literally hundreds of legislative proposals or pieces of legislation in different countries that have had to be amended as a result of this proposal."
"Unless all colleagues move together to do this, and all countries move together to do this, that discrimination is going to remain."
"This has to be done consistently. Otherwise, those barriers will remain."
"That is why I want first of all to pay tribute particularly to the Commission for the leading role it has played in managing and coordinating the whole process among Member States of carrying out and transposing this legislation."
"I also want to thank the Council and, indeed, successive Councils, since this proposal was agreed back in 2006, who have led the process which we have actually seen in summits calling for the consistent transposition of this directive."
"I want to say particularly to Cecilia Malmström, the Minister here tonight, how impressed the committee was with the work that Sweden was doing when we went to visit Sweden on a mission back in September."
"I think that they have clearly set an example to many other people and, in particular, in the meticulous way in which they are ensuring that public authorities at all levels in Sweden understand their obligations under European law in order to be able to authorise service companies coming from other places within the European Union."
"Our question tonight focuses, in particular, on what we regard as the most important elements to be put in place as soon as possible."
"Member States have been required to go through the screening process of their legislation to look, as I say, for those discriminatory elements."
"But the transposition on 28 December is just the start of the process of removing obstacles, because every country is now going to come up with a list of proposals which discriminate against other countries and which, they believe, they can justify in the public interest."
"That mutual evaluation process - which is an entirely new one - requires other Member State authorities to look at each other, at each other's discriminatory proposals."
"That is going to be a vital part that starts, and we are following that with great interest."
"We would like to hear tonight how the Commission is proposing to approach that process."
"We would like to know from the Council what support they are giving to that."
"We would also like an assurance that this is not going to be a process done behind closed doors, because consumers and businesses and other interest groups will want to know how that process is being carried out."
"We want to see that list."
"We want to see the list of regulations and internal statutes that Member States want to retain."
"Second is information and access to procedures through electronic technology."
"Setting up the points of single contact for business is a ground-breaking proposal, again, in any European directive."
"Member States are required to make that information and access to the procedures necessary for businesses to complete to allow them to trade through those systems."
"It is vital that we have full and complete systems set up."
"So that is what our question is here tonight."
"We look forward to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner - perhaps in a field that is not so familiar to her - giving us some comprehensive answers."
"We know you will give our best wishes to Charlie McCreevy from everybody."
"I think it is important to understand, however, the perspective of my committee."
"For us, this is also the start of a process over the next five years of monitoring and sustaining political interest and pressure on all the Member States to deliver this directive."
"I have to say to Cecilia Malmström that it was disappointing, to say the least, to see in the report that a Competitiveness Council discussed back in September a note from the Commission that, it would appear, in some Member States the political commitment to full and timely implementation has unfortunately not been translated into appropriate action."
"That is not good enough."
"We want the benefits and we want them now."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Harbour and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for raising this important issue."
"Just as Mr Harbour said, the free movement of services is one of the cornerstones of the internal market."
"It accounts for 60-70% of the EU's economy and employment and it is growing."
"It will play a very important part in the EU's economic growth, but as has also been pointed out, the free movement of services has not worked as well as it should have done."
"There is still much to be done to remove barriers to trade and to facilitate the trade in services, and it is excellent therefore that we now have the Services Directive, which is to be transposed by 28 December."
"The Commission is ultimately responsible for the Member States doing what they are supposed to do and I am sure that the Commission will talk about this, but I will nevertheless say a few words on behalf of the Presidency on the basis of the question that has been put to me by the committee."
"The first thing I would like to say is about the screening of legislation and how it has contributed to the implementation."
"The purpose of this is to identify and eliminate barriers to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services."
"The requirements relating to the provision of services that the Member States retain must comply with the requirements for non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality."
"This is a huge task, but when it is finished, the service sector will benefit from a reduction in the administrative burden for companies providing services."
"The final report to the Commission on this should be ready on 28 December."
"The national points of contact are to gather information concerning rights and requirements in the services sector for service providers and the recipients of services."
"They are to give service providers the opportunity to apply for authorisation online and to communicate with the authorisation authority."
"Of course, this is quite difficult for the Member States to organise."
"It is based on the idea of us having a more modern system with a high degree of e-governance."
"Next week, the Swedish Presidency is holding a ministerial meeting in Malmö on precisely the subject of e-governance."
"At this meeting, the Member States will receive support from the Commission and a lot of seminars will be held to enable us to learn from one another so that we can make user-friendliness the main focus."
"Another important issue is the language used on the web portals and the option of being able to use this facility in a language other than the Member States' own."
"This is not a requirement in the directive, but hopefully most Member States will have information in several languages at the points of contact."
"This will give service providers a better opportunity to compare different markets and obtain the overview needed to be able to expand their operations."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection asks whether the Member States will be able to implement the directive in time, and I hope that they will be able to."
"The Commission will have to answer this, but in fact, in the Competitiveness Council, all Member States stated that they would be ready in time."
"Political support for this is, of course, very important."
"What are the biggest challenges, then?"
"The directive as a whole is, of course, extremely wide-ranging and it requires a number of measures to be taken by the Member States, not only in terms of legislation, but also various measures to facilitate cooperation."
"These structures that we will hopefully have in place will make governance more efficient and more up-to-date."
"However, it will take time to put this in place."
"Screening the legislation in this huge area and finding legislative solutions cannot be accomplished overnight."
"Authorities will need to be trained with regard to their new duties, and this will require resources."
"So the answer to the question of what the biggest challenges are is, of course, the setting up of the points of single contact and ensuring that they work."
"Lastly, Parliament asks how the interested stakeholders have been involved."
"This is an important question, because it is, of course, a fundamental part of the process for the various stakeholder organisations to be involved in creating an understanding of the Services Directive, communicating the advantages to citizens and companies, but also discovering their views and needs."
"This dialogue has been a key element."
"Many interested stakeholders were already involved in reference groups during the negotiation period and in many cases, these networks have continued."
"In many countries, there has been broad social consultation on the proposals for implementation in order to obtain various pieces of information and views."
"Finally, Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it is showing in the process of implementing the Services Directive."
"In view of the very important role that the European Parliament played in reaching an agreement, it is good that you remain interested and are checking and ensuring that we are doing what we are supposed to do in the Member States."
"We agree that it is especially important for the directive to be put in place promptly and in the correct way, and, particularly now during the economic crisis, the Services Directive will be an important tool to take us out of the crisis and allow us once again to concentrate on economic growth and, hopefully, to create jobs."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for putting forward this timely oral question, particularly also on behalf of my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, on the state of the implementation of the Services Directive."
"It is a little less than two months before the implementation deadline, and it is a good time to look back on the work that has been done so far and to take stock of where things are today."
"The Services Directive is one of the most important initiatives adopted in recent years."
"It has a great potential to remove barriers to trade in the internal market and to modernise our public administrations, and proper implementation becomes even more pressing in the current economic context."
"We know that very well and the European Parliament, and in particular, its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, have not only played a key role in making its adoption possible but the Commission also particularly appreciated your continued interest in monitoring the work done by the Member States to implement the directive."
"For our part, the Commission has delivered on its commitment to facilitate the implementation process."
"This was already mentioned."
"We have taken Member States' requests for technical assistance seriously and we have deployed unprecedented efforts and resources to support their work."
"More than 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held and expert groups met in Brussels over 30 times during the last three years."
"But the Commission cannot carry out the implementation at national level."
"This is the role of Member States, and transposing the Services Directive has been a challenging task for them."
"It has been challenging because it involved the carrying out of several large-scale projects, such as the setting-up of 'points of single contact' and the review and simplification of legislation relating to services."
"It has been challenging also because it involved intensive coordination between all levels of the administration, be it at national, regional or local level."
"So where do things stand today?"
"And will Member States deliver?"
"Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of 2009 deadline or in the beginning of 2010."
"Some Member States might be late."
"This is not entirely satisfactory, in particular, for citizens and businesses wanting to make use of their rights in the internal market."
"Although the situation is not unusual compared to other internal market directives, it gives some reason for concern."
"But it must also be taken into account that, perhaps more than for any other directive, Member States needed to address a huge amount of difficult legal and practical issues."
"And given this, the result that we hope to achieve by the beginning of next year may actually be considered as quite good."
"Let me now reply in more detail to your question."
"So, almost all Member States have completed the process of 'screening' their national legislation."
"Some are still working on it."
"The extent to which the screening has contributed to an effective transposition of the directive is, of course, also somewhat difficult to assess at this stage."
"The transposition deadline has not yet expired, and Member States have not yet submitted their legislative changes to the Commission."
"But it is clear that an ambitious and thorough process of screening is crucial to ensure the 'internal market friendliness' of national legislation in each and every Member State."
"And it is also crucial for the competitiveness of our services sector in general."
"As regards the points of single contact, it seems clear that most Member States will at least have basic, practical, point-of-single-contact solutions in place by the end of 2009."
"These will, again, not be totally perfect, but they should form a solid basis."
"Member States should continue developing and upgrading the points of single contact which, in the long run, should become fully-fledged e-government centres."
"In this context, the Commission agrees with the importance of providing additional information and procedures through the points of single contact, such as those related to workers rights and taxation."
"Businesses and consumers need to be aware of the applicable rules."
"But as you know, this is not mandatory under the directive."
"We expect, as the points of single contact consolidate and develop, this information will also be provided."
"Indeed, some Member States are already planning to do so."
"As regards the implementation of the directive in the area of social services - to the extent that they are covered by it - this does not seem to have raised particular problems."
"The directive itself contains mechanisms to ensure the specificities of these services are taken into account."
"Finally, I think it is clear that stakeholders have played a vital role throughout the implementation process."
"They have followed Member States' efforts closely and have been involved in implementation in different ways, and we will ensure that stakeholders are consulted next year during the evaluation of the results of the implementation."
"So we need to find a method to ensure that this consultation is targeted and very concrete."
"Finally, many Member States have had open consultation on the draft implementing legislation during the legislative process."
"Some stakeholder organisations have even organised regular surveys with their members on the state of implementation."
"Let us say it is important to be realistic and honest at this stage of the process."
"A lot still remains to be done in the area of implementation, and those Member States who are behind schedule need to make extra efforts."
"I remain convinced, however, that the glass is more than half full. But we had better keep filling it and quickly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have just heard from the Commission and the Council is somewhat discouraging."
"Europe faces international competition, global competition, in which European service providers also need to find their place and be successful."
"If we look at the history of this directive, which started life in Parliament with a significant level of participation by the Members, it is, in my view, rather discouraging to hear that the glass is half full, or half empty, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament has not only played a role in the past, but intends to fulfil its role in future, too."
"We have therefore decided, within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to address this question to you in good time before the transposition deadline in order to check whether you, as the Member States of the European Union, have undertaken your obligations, which were originally proposed by you, to transpose this directive by the end of this year, and whether you are able to meet this target."
"At least as far as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, I am still assuming that you will do everything you can to fulfil your claim in the coming months."
"We will appraise the directive and its implementation from the point of view of the citizens of Europe, the service providers and the workers, and against this background we will examine closely how the Member States behave towards one another and the level of transparency - as mentioned by the Chairman - with which the exchange of views over the elements of the directive is carried out and how effectively the Member States' regulations are screened for their suitability for the internal market as far as service providers are concerned."
"The same applies to the scope of the directive."
"Here, too, as we have done in the past, we will observe closely the degree to which the European Court of Justice might interpret the EU Treaty so as to give priority to the rights of citizens and that - as we sometimes get the impression happens in the Council - the interests of the Member States do not always take priority."
"Secondly, we are very pleased about the point you mentioned with regard to the electronic management of the process, but the key issue in our view is whether service providers can ultimately carry out all the tasks required under the procedure in a simple and effective way using the online process and whether, behind these many home pages, they will actually find people they can talk to about the matter and about the requirements in the Member States, or whether we are not simply constructing walls and barriers here."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the President is asking me to be quick."
"I would like to come to my last point."
"In the previous debate, Parliament called, in particular, for the Internal Market Information System to remove all the problems that the administrations of the Member States may reasonably experience in connection with the transposition of the directive, and I therefore hope, Mrs Malmström, that you will make every effort to ensure that this directive can enter into force on 31 December this year."
"Mr President, I am grateful that we are able to debate this topic today, as it is such an important one."
"I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: as Parliament, we have not merely played a part, but we have ensured that, in this Services Directive, a very positive, constructive compromise was found."
"This compromise is based, in particular, on guaranteeing labour and social rights and on the particular regard for and removal of the services of general economic interest."
"That was the reason why a Services Directive was possible in the first place."
"However, there are a few things than I am not sure about in this regard, and the questions that we raised have not been answered."
"It would, for example, be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true, namely, that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we, as legislators, have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive."
"This relates not only to the working conditions, which are being called into question, but in many Member States, the definitions are also being re-written or made more restrictive."
"There are also Member States which, with feeble justifications, are not removing the social services from amongst the services to which this transposition relates."
"In this respect, the European Commission's Handbook was not very helpful, because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was, in our opinion, incorrect."
"The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest, so that social rights, such as labour rights, can also be fully and completely respected once again."
"Anything else would not be sufficient."
"I would also like to ask the Member States to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and, in particular, the trade unions and the social services, in the transposition."
"This is a question that we raised, but to which I have not heard an answer, and I would very much like a good answer to this question."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's response is, of course, not only discouraging, as Mr Schwab said, but also very disappointing."
"When it comes to the transposition, we need to realise that if you say that around 50% are on schedule, then we have to assume that the other 50% are a long way from achieving that."
"Take my own country, Germany, for example: the individual Federal Länder are currently transposing this directive."
"In Rhineland-Palatinate, where I live, I had the opportunity, on 2 September, to participate in the first reading for the transposition of the Services Directive for this Federal Land."
"As you can imagine, it will be impossible to achieve the transposition on time, and I believe that the other Federal Länder are in a similar position."
"The crucial factor for us, of course, will be how the transposition is carried out."
"If Article 13(2) stipulates that 'authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service' then we must take great care to ensure that this does not happen in practice."
"A decisive factor, for example, will be how the single points of contact are equipped."
"Will they have language skills?"
"Will they work closely enough with the administrations to also be able to deal with the concerns put to them?"
"We very much doubt it."
"In fact, the committee should now be asking which countries are behind schedule with this, which countries make up the 50% and when do they expect to achieve this."
"It would then be better to create a moratorium, or something similar, for these countries."
"I am certain that, in most countries, this directive will not be transposed by 1 January 2010, even though these countries have had more than four years to do this."
"That is a major problem and it is very disappointing."
"Mr President, in the discussion which is under way, I would like to ask about the effect of the crisis on implementation of the directive in EU countries."
"In my country, Poland, despite the crisis and difficulties with transposition, it has been possible to draft a law on services which is based on a high degree of liberalisation in registering and running a business."
"In sectors such as crafts, trade, tourism and hotels, the restrictions are only exceptions."
"We are doing this in the name of equal opportunities and protection of the principle of healthy competition."
"The compromise of 2006 assumed that certain areas would be excluded from regulation of the directive."
"I would like to ask what the evaluation of those decisions looks like today."
"It was assumed then that in the future, further legislative work would be undertaken on the question of public utility services."
"Keeping to the metaphor used by the Commissioner, after filling the glass which is already half-full, will there be another, and what will happen next?"
"Mr President, in the compromise reached in 2006, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament withdrew demands for social considerations to be given priority over the freedom of companies that provide services."
"Otherwise, as Mr Harbour wrote in a press release, it would not have been a compromise."
"The term 'country of origin principle' has been deleted, but it has been replaced by a conflict of laws regulation from the Commission that clearly states that, in the event of a conflict between the labour market laws of different Member States, the law of the country of origin of the company shall apply."
"The directive could have been interpreted as meaning that the EU would not interfere in national labour law."
"However, the Commission quickly drew up guidelines stating that companies providing services do not need to have a permanent representative in the country in which the work is carried out, and therefore the trade union has no counterpart with which to negotiate. The Vaxholm ruling also clearly stated that Swedish labour law is subordinate to EC law, which meant that Sweden was forced to reduce the standard of its labour law legislation."
"I, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, can see no alternative for workers rights other than for us to provide a clear legal protocol in the treaty in which union rights take precedence over market freedoms."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, the Services Directive represents the end of a journey for Europe, a journey of which the final destination is precisely the completion of the internal market so as to facilitate trade within the European Union, and to thus enable the authorities to coordinate their efforts and, above all, to minimise the transaction costs between the different operations within the different sectors and the different Member States."
"Harmonising the contents of the various administrative procedures and making it easier for service providers to operate in other Member States automatically means increasing growth and therefore also stimulating growth in a period of exceptional crisis such as this."
"The Services Directive, adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council on 12 December 2006, is an intrinsic part of the Lisbon Strategy, which has been revised over time and adapted to the various situations that Europe has experienced over the last nine years, and its main objective absolutely must be to make the European economy the world's most competitive economy, but also a knowledge-based economy."
"The economic crisis that we are going through and that the European Union is tackling at institutional level, skilfully reconciling the various measures taken with the individual Member States too, requires the Services Directive to be applied even more correctly and more swiftly than was necessary when it was first adopted."
"The deadline of 28 December 2009 for the transposition of the Services Directive is therefore not only an indication of the date set for moving on, of course, from the ratification to the legislative process of this directive, but also, and above all, it represents an important step towards a Europe that is increasingly aware of its resources and, more specifically, that is increasingly capable of getting the best out of those resources."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since its adoption and the heated debates that surrounded it, the Services Directive has somewhat faded into obscurity, but it is important to show that we are particularly vigilant in the crucial phase of its transposition."
"I question the interpretation of the provisions of Article 2 of the directive linked to the exclusion of social services from its scope."
"Notions such as 'support for persons in need' and 'mandated providers' seem restrictive when compared with the definition of social services used in certain Member States, and I am concerned that a deliberately strict interpretation may serve to justify the inclusion of whole swathes of these services in the scope of the directive."
"The exclusion of these services is a key element of the text and a guarantee for the citizens that the European social model will be protected."
"I hope that certain Member States, including France, will not take advantage of the transposition in order to liberalise social services, under the false pretext that they are complying with European laws."
"These problems to do with the integration of services of general interest demonstrate the need to have European legislation that is specific to them and not to stick to a default definition as part of a directive on commercial services."
"(PL) Mr President, proper implementation of the Directive on services in the internal market is important not only for European entrepreneurs operating in that market, but also for consumers."
"The Services Directive is a good example."
"A period of three years has been allowed for its implementation."
"That is a long time, but even so, not all countries will manage to transpose the directive within the three years."
"This example shows most conspicuously that ideal cooperation between Member States and European institutions is needed in order to achieve transposition in time in all Member States."
"Indeed, this is the direction taken in the recommendations issued by the Commission in June this year concerning means for improving the functioning of the internal market."
"I think that in the implementation process, it is necessary to go a little further."
"Therefore, in the report concerning the table of results for the internal market, I propose the initiative of organising a forum for the internal market, which would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition, so that we will be able to apply and execute legislation on the internal market, including this extremely important directive."
"I would like the forum to be a place for the exchange of experience of Member States and EU institutions in the area of transposition."
"I would like the forum to draw the attention of society to questions concerning the internal market."
"We must increase our citizens' interest in the functioning of and responsibility for the market."
"Then we will have achieved complete success."
"In connection with the problems which we heard about a moment ago concerning transposition of the Services Directive, I would like to ask if Member States have sought to cooperate with the Commission, and if it can be said that in the implementation process, they have succeeded in applying any of the Commission's recommendations?"
"Does the Commission continue to seek new solutions?"
"Is it making use of all possibilities and means to mobilise and support especially those countries which are experiencing problems with transposition?"
"Are there any new ideas on this matter?"
"(MT) It is worrying that our regular contacts with the local authorities, at least in my country, confirm that many of them are still in the dark as to what awaits them once this directive enters into force."
"Generally speaking, there is little knowledge as regards the current laws on the four freedoms."
"There also appears to be a lack of information on anything related to the laws and regulations on financial services, e-communication services and transport services."
"Furthermore, it seems that the authorities might have problems in simplifying the administrative process and harmonising trade and other licensing regulations."
"Therefore, the Commission needs to adopt further initiatives so as to provide immediate and direct assistance to local and regional authorities."
"Moreover, if we really want the implementation process to fully reflect what we agreed upon within Parliament, then it is imperative that the European Parliament remains involved in the process, even after the directive enters into force."
"(PL) Mr President, in conditions of recession we should, as a rule, strive to create new jobs, increase competitiveness, foster price reductions, or, to put it succinctly, increase benefits to the consumer."
"We are doing this, for example, by subsidising the motor industry."
"We are talking about such occupations as hairdressers, plumbers and bricklayers, who do not need subsidies."
"They do need, however, freedom to do their work."
"Regulations and reality - if only they were in agreement."
"I know of the example of a bakery built in a neighbouring country."
"While it was a question of consent to build it, everything was alright."
"However, when production started, the government and the local authorities withdrew their consent."
"Why?"
"The association of local bakers protested."
"If only this type of practice were never employed."
"Commissioner, let us agree also to name the 50% of Member States which do implement the legislation."
"Which ones are they?"
"I would also like to ask that we receive in January a proposal for precise monitoring of the transposition of this directive in individual Member States."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the Commissioner that the Services Directive is one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in recent years, and that its proper implementation is extremely important."
"In the previous parliamentary term, I had the opportunity to work on the provisions of the Services Directive."
"I still remember the huge effort made by all of us here in the European Parliament in drawing up its provisions."
"I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Services Directive and am deeply convinced - and this is something I often stress in meetings with entrepreneurs - that it represents a huge opportunity both for them, and also for the entire economy of Europe."
"However, it will be possible to transform the opportunity into specific results only if the appropriate legislation is implemented by Member States appropriately and on time."
"Therefore, I am joining the appeal for acceleration of the implementation process by national authorities which still have not completed essential work in this area, in particular, on the question of proper implementation of the principle of freedom to offer services and of individual contact points."
"I follow carefully implementation of the Services Directive in individual countries, as I do also in my own country of Poland, where work on suitable implementation of the directive's provisions is still under way."
"I hope the outcome of these efforts will be satisfactory."
"(SV) Mr President, the Nordic labour market model is based on agreements between the social partners."
"This type of model does not work if one of the partners, in this case, a service provider, does not have a representative in place with whom negotiations can be carried out."
"We were therefore very pleased with the decision taken on the Services Directive, which we believe means that the right to negotiate, enter into and apply collective agreements, and to take industrial action in accordance with national legislation and practice, would not be affected."
"Nevertheless, during the implementation of the Services Directive in Sweden, a debate arose as to whether or not it is permissible to lay down a requirement for there to be a competent representative of the company."
"Thus, my question is: does the directive in any way prevent the host country laying down the requirement for the services company to have a representative in place with the mandate to negotiate and enter into agreements?"
"(PT) In the course of this debate, we must not forget the serious implications that transposition of this directive on the liberalisation of services will have in a number of countries, particularly those with highly unstable social situations, further worsening a crisis situation like the one we are experiencing."
"Even with all the concern shown in the various Member States, unless immediate measures are taken to defend social and workers' rights and to protect the most fragile sectors, including in public service areas, we could have even more serious problems."
"Liberalisation could increase unemployment, poverty and inequalities among the most vulnerable, and only benefit large service companies and economic groups, particularly in the wealthiest countries."
"Therefore, at this time of crisis, one vital measure is to postpone transposition of the directive on the liberalisation of services and to conduct an appropriate study of the potential social implications that implementation of this directive would have."
"Mr President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is to be thanked for highlighting this important issue, the implementation of the Services Directive."
"In particular, the economic crisis which we are in must not be allowed to be used by countries, entrepreneurs or anybody else to drive us back to protectionism, which would be a disaster in the overall context."
"On the broader front, trade in services can be the driving force for economic recovery and, indeed, Ireland has prospered since we engaged in foreign trade."
"The new crisis would be far worse in Ireland if we did not have the broader base to trade internationally, facilitated by the internal market."
"Indeed, opening up our borders to foreign competition has not brought any negative consequences for domestic services."
"It has, in fact, fostered competition and innovation."
"So, what has been proposed today is something I support 100%."
"Finally, I would just like to say that it was good to hear somebody here say something good about the Irish Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, who is a friend of mine although he is from a different political grouping."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we are talking about the Services Directive."
"The aim of this directive was to put into practice the fourth fundamental freedom of the European integration project, since we are today talking of anniversaries."
"It was adopted three years ago, and now the period given to the Member States in which to adapt their national laws and remove obstacles has come to an end."
"Now that this period has passed, it is time to assess what state we are now in, who has transposed the legislation and who has not, and under what conditions."
"My question, however, is whether the Commission considers that a greater level of harmonisation is required and, if so, whether it is thinking of proposing any legislative initiative in relation to this extremely important Services Directive, seeking to harmonise the market and the rights of consumers, citizens and workers."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you again for raising this very important issue."
"I think there is general agreement that the Services Directive is very important and that it is really urgent that we try to implement it as soon as possible."
"The Swedish Presidency is doing its utmost, as have earlier presidencies, to make sure that this goes smoothly and quickly."
"We have had several discussions in different Council formations."
"We have had seminars and discussions on it, and it has been placed on the agenda to encourage real progress on this issue."
"However, almost two months remain, and the answer to the question of who is lagging behind may change."
"There is still time."
"Our aim is clear - and I know that it is the Commission's aim as well - and it is that all countries should have implemented the directive by 28 December 2009."
"There might be some delays."
"We deplore that, of course, but I know that all countries are working as quickly and swiftly as possible."
"A question was asked about how the contact points would function."
"Well, they do not exist yet, but the aim is for them to function in a user-friendly and effective way and to contain all the relevant information that is needed, both by the service suppliers and by consumers."
"Member States have collaborated with the Commission to supply an information leaflet, available in all languages, to facilitate access for citizens and consumers to the relevant information."
"Many Member States are also making their own efforts in order to spread information about the directive."
"There is also an agreement to have a common logo to make it easier for users to navigate between the different websites and the contact points."
"Some Member States - although it is not compulsory - will provide information on working rights and labour laws at their contact points."
"The Services Directive does not cover labour law and the posting of workers is excluded from it."
"The question put to me by my Swedish colleagues is a Swedish issue."
"We are looking into that, and it is a little outside this debate."
"We will be happy to come back to it in a more national context."
"The Services Directive is important."
"It will make life easier for service providers, it will facilitate free movement and will be beneficial for investment, for growth and jobs and it will be very good for the citizens."
"The citizens look to us to ensure that it is in place as soon as possible because it will facilitate their life."
"It is our responsibility to make sure that we do our utmost to see this happen."
"I would like to thank Parliament again, not only for its contribution in voting on and adopting the Services Directive, but also for acting as a watchdog and continuing to push the Council and the Commission to do what we can in order for it to come into place."
"But there is still some time remaining and possibly we will come back to this debate next year, under the Spanish Presidency."
"The Commission will still be watching this very closely."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as has been said before, we have discussed all the questions surrounding all the different social and other aspects of this directive."
"I do not think we should reopen this discussion now, but we do have to look to the Member States to see how they have implemented or will implement the directive."
"On the basis of the already available information, it does seem that a majority of Member States will have completed the implementation either by the end of the year or maybe the beginning of 2010."
"So I think one can also say that most Member States will at least have set up the basic single contact point and will therefore be ready to comply with their administrative cooperation agreements and obligations."
"In some cases, however, there might be delays as far as the changes in the legal framework are concerned."
"With regard to the review process, some Member States have taken the opportunity of the review to simplify laws and procedures and have made a considerable number of changes."
"Other Member States have enacted only a few amendments, and the number of changes made of course depends on several factors including the existing regulatory framework and also the internal organisation of Member States: in federal states, it is more complicated than for others."
"Of course, this also depends on the willingness of a Member State to simplify laws and procedures."
"With regard to the question of proper implementation, my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, has, on many occasions, drawn the attention of members of the Member States' governments to the importance of the work on implementation, and he and his staff have followed and monitored the implementation process very closely."
"Indeed, as I said before, during the last three years, more than 80 bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held, and expert groups met in Brussels over 30 times."
"So we have been very active on that."
"And we will continue to follow Member States' work and will also continue to provide technical assistance if desired by the Member States."
"But in the end, it is also clearly the Member States' responsibility to do the work and also allocate the necessary resources."
"As regards next year, I think it will be crucial to ensure that the process of mutual evaluation provided for in the directive is used in a constructive way."
"We will also have to assess the quality of implementation of the legislation, as was asked, monitor the functioning of the single contact points and then also get feedback from businesses and from consumers."
"Last but not least, we may also need to resort to other enforcement mechanisms - sometimes maybe to infringement cases, but it is too early now to say that."
"On the small and medium-sized enterprises, of course, we are of the same opinion as you."
"They are the backbone of the EU economy and their concerns are at the heart of the Services Directive."
"So this directive will benefit all businesses, but SMEs will benefit most, and at the present time, SMEs very often decide to stay at home because of all the legal complexities and also because of the absence of transparent information."
"Therefore, the Services Directive will do away with many of these complexities and - we all think - give a boost to them."
"To the Commission's knowledge, no Member State is using the implementation of the Services Directive to reduce workers' rights."
"I would like to say that very clearly."
"Workers' rights as such are not affected or dealt with by the Services Directive."
"Indeed, this was clearly a result of the practical and political compromise reached by both Parliament and the Council."
"Finally, I would like to reiterate that Parliament has been a key partner throughout the history of the Services Directive."
"Over the past three years, the Commission has found it important to keep you involved in the implementation process and informed about our work with the Member States and, as was mentioned earlier, this will remain a key action to making the internal market work better, to deliver the growth and jobs we need."
"Proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue, especially in the current difficult economic crisis."
"That concludes the item."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Europe must be competitive."
"Thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, the Services Directive will help implement the hitherto not entirely regulated free movement of services within the European Union's internal market."
"The Services Directive regulates licensing procedures, indicating prohibited requirements, and confirms that from 2010, all new requirements for service providers must be non-discriminatory, justified by important social interests; it also regulates the principal functions of the point of contact being established."
"Most importantly, the costs of service provision are reduced at interstate level, and this is particularly important in this period of economic recession."
"Lithuania is joining the list of Member States that are ready to implement the provisions of the Services Directive on time."
"Indeed, it is very important for the Commission to cooperate closely and effectively with the Member States, as in some countries, there is a lack of information and insufficient levels of preparedness for the implementation of the directive."
"At present, only 50% of the Member States are ready to transpose the provisions of the Services Directive into national legislation."
"Mr President, Member States must fully implement the Services Directive by 28 December 2009, which would, as in the case of goods and products, open up the services market to private individuals and companies."
"This directive would help small and medium-sized enterprises to a large extent and promote job creation and economic growth, while taking consumers' interests into account."
"However, some Member States have decided to restrict employment for citizens from new Member States which joined in 2004 and 2007."
"Germany and Austria wish to maintain this restriction until 2011, without any more serious economic and social motive."
"France and Belgium are applying a similar regulation with regard to Romania and Bulgaria."
"However, by now it is clear that the fears personified by the notorious 'Polish plumber' are groundless."
"The number of Central and East Europeans working in France is far less, for instance, than the number employed in the UK, even though the decision was made by Paris three years ago to gradually remove the restrictions in those professions where there was a labour shortage."
"These measures are hindering, to a large extent, the implementation of the Services Directive, one of the basic pillars of which is the complete removal of discrimination on economic and nationality grounds."
"Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, which swept away the borders between East and West, we can say that the Services Directive also serves a similar aim."
"The successful implementation of this directive would finally do away with the false image that has been promoted of the 'Polish plumber'."
"Before any implementation of the directive, the European Parliament should carry out a counter-assessment of the human and social impact of its application by taking account, in particular, of the consequences of the crisis that we are going through."
"Indeed, everything points to the fact that this directive will result in the European Union's businesses, craftspeople and employees being pitted against one another."
"Recently, a professional agricultural organisation revealed that the French authorities were proposing that it set up, in the countries of Eastern Europe, employment agencies for agricultural workers who are lower paid and less socially protected than French workers."
"The transposition of the Services Directive must not lead to the introduction of such practices, which lead to the levelling down of social Europe."
"Furthermore, we are very concerned about the threats hanging over the services of general interest (SGI) due to the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"We therefore continue to hope for another European legislative framework that will optimise and develop public services in particular."
"The Services Directive (2006/123/EC) is characterised by partial liberalisation of the flow of services in the European Union."
"The objective of bringing such a directive into effect was to release economic potential."
"The directive has opened up many possibilities, both for consumers and for entrepreneurs."
"Greater use of the single market has become possible."
"The main beneficiaries of liberalisation of the market for services include small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the previously existing barriers had caused the greatest difficulties."
"According to the European Commission, around 70% of the GDP of EU Member States is generated from services."
"A similar figure is given for the proportion of the workforce engaged in service provision."
"One of the advantages of bringing the directive into force is the resultant rise in competitiveness in the internal market."
"Application of this directive has proved to be an opportunity for development of the European economy and has allowed jobs to be created."
"It should be added that this has achieved one of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, concerning a rise in the competitiveness of the European economy."
"In addition, it has brought about an increase in the range of services being offered."
"The effects which have been achieved are an encouragement to continue work on the further liberalisation of this directive."
"Joint Programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on"
"joint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease - B7-0218/2009)"
"The author, Herbert Reul, has indicated that he is running late."
"If he arrives, he may be given the floor at the end."
"Mr President, in the absence of Mr Reul, I will repeat this question that we are putting to the Commission."
"In accordance with the legal basis of Article 165 of the treaty, the Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases calls for Parliament to be consulted."
"We want to know whether the Council can confirm its intention to adopt conclusions on this issue during the Competitiveness Council of 3 December 2009."
"Moreover, since Parliament was consulted on the Commission's proposal, is the Council prepared to take Parliament's views into account when drafting its conclusions?"
"Next, regarding possible future joint programming of research activities, can the Council confirm its opinion that these initiatives should, in principle, be adopted using the same legal basis?"
"I should like to point out that we have drafted a resolution."
"This resolution has the support of all the political groups and it is important because, quite simply, it highlights the challenges of an ageing population - these challenges that mean that, today, in Europe, we have more than seven million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a figure that it is estimated will double over the next 20 years."
"It is therefore crucial to plan, invest and cooperate in this area in order to control the social costs of these diseases, and to offer hope, dignity and a healthier life to the millions of sufferers and their families."
"These health and social problems, which affect the whole of Europe, require coordinated measures designed to ensure the effectiveness of the prevention, diagnoses, treatment and care provided to the people concerned."
"Special attention must be paid to support for the research and innovation work carried out by public and private operators in an effort to find new cures and to prevent the development of these diseases."
"Health research is even more fragmented at European level, and the number of public-private partnerships must be increased."
"The example of the Innovative Medicines initiative, launched in February 2008, must not remain a one-off experiment."
"I shall conclude by saying that this really is a race against the clock, for we must forestall these diseases as much as possible."
"Research today shows that there are already initiatives aimed at pre-diagnosis."
"It is on these concrete issues that our fellow citizens are expecting signals from the Europe for health, which must give guarantees and anticipate the development of age-related diseases."
"Mr President, the proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's, which was adopted by the Commission on 22 July, is based on Article 165 of the treaty."
"This article talks about coordination of research and technological development activities between the Community and the Member States, precisely to ensure greater consistency between national policies and Community policy."
"Article 165 accords with the objectives for joint programming initiatives."
"These objectives are based on the idea that we jointly establish the challenges that our societies are collectively facing and that, through increased political commitment on the part of the Member States, we can agree on joint or coordinated responses to these challenges."
"The aim, of course, is to increase efficiency in the public financing of research in Europe."
"However, I believe that the problem and the key to your question is that Article 165 does not give the Council the right to act."
"This article constitutes a legal basis for the Commission to take possible initiatives to promote coordination between the Member States and the Community's policy."
"There is no other legal basis in the treaty under the heading of research that the Commission could use to propose measures relating to joint programming initiatives."
"There is, of course, a very strong political commitment within the Council for introducing pilot initiatives for joint programming aimed at combating Alzheimer's, in particular, as soon as possible."
"In the light of this, it is the Presidency's view that the Council should adopt conclusions on this joint programming initiative on the basis of the text that has been tabled by the Commission."
"I know that the European Parliament gives high priority to the fight against Alzheimer's disease."
"In a declaration issued in February, Parliament called on the Commission and the Member States to recognise this fight as a European public health priority."
"You are, of course, familiar with the Commission's proposal."
"The Presidency will try to ensure that Parliament's views are, as far as possible, incorporated into the conclusions that are to be adopted when the Competitiveness Council meets on 3 December this year."
"As regards possible future joint programming initiatives, the Council shares the Member's view that a common approach should be chosen to adopt these initiatives under the research heading."
"Unfortunately, there is currently only one method available and that is to adopt Council conclusions for each separate initiative."
"This is because the treaty contains no appropriate legal basis for adopting other measures."
"The Swedish Presidency wishes to adopt in December the conclusions regarding the measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases without even waiting for Parliament's view on this issue."
"I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on this dossier and, given these circumstances, I support the adoption of a resolution to express Parliament's position on the measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease, through joint programming of research activities."
"Neurodegenerative diseases pose a major health problem in Europe."
"Advances in medical science and the standard of living in developed countries have created conditions resulting in an increase in life expectancy, but the number of people affected by neurodegenerative disease has also risen."
"This is a problem which has a number of different aspects to it."
"Some aspects relate to the quality of life of those affected by these diseases, the impact which the disease has on their close family or on those who care for them."
"It is equally a problem affecting the sustainability of the health care systems which will have to cope with an increased number of patients, at a time when, as a result of the ageing population, the proportion of people no longer working is on the rise."
"The Commission's proposal focuses on the research-related aspects."
"The resolution which we are proposing equally emphasises the results which will be achieved through coordinating research activities and the extent to which they will help improve the current situation."
"Therefore, I urge our efforts to be focused in two main areas: scientific research and ensuring that the efforts made are reflected in the results achieved in terms of the quality of care which patients can enjoy."
"Bearing in mind the interest which Parliament has shown over time in this area and the importance of this dossier, which is a pilot project for the joint programming of research activities, it is vital that Parliament's position is taken into account when drafting the Council's conclusions."
"Parliament must be involved in all initiatives relating to future joint programming in the field of research."
"In fact, Article 182 of the Treaty of Lisbon ensures a suitable legal basis for future developments in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative that we are about to launch is very important for two reasons: the first is the subject of the research, which concerns the fight against neurodegenerative diseases, and the second is the joint programming methods for the research."
"Clearly, we would have preferred Parliament to have been more directly involved in the pilot project - this has been said and it is the subject of our question."
"While we must press on now and not bring matters to a halt, we are nonetheless asking for guarantees that our opinion will be taken into account in the Competitiveness Council's deliberations, and that a more certain legal basis will be defined in future so that Parliament can be fully involved and there can be a greater sense of ownership in this field of research."
"We must now intervene with adequate means and resources to prevent and eradicate the widespread scourge of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and the other diseases, which are destined to become more common as our population ages."
"We call for efforts to be focused on extensive, large-scale studies, aimed both at diagnosis and at identifying cures."
"Research into biomarkers, into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach, the compilation of vast databases, and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial."
"I wish to make just one request in this House: that we ignore neither the individual circumstances of patients, which are too often excluded in the context of these types of disease, nor the involvement of patients' and relatives' associations."
"From a methodological point of view, we believe that joint research projects are very important because they fulfil an essential requirement: that of pooling efforts and resources and overcoming these divisions, these duplications, and therefore being able to create a critical mass that is sufficient to produce satisfactory results from this type of research."
"If we consider that, in other parts of the world, joint public and private efforts manage to invest tens of millions of euros, we realise how much there remains for us to do and how much we still have to do, by directing our efforts towards joint projects, towards strategic lines of action and joint programmes between the Member States and Europe and towards common programmes between public and private operators, without disregarding that international framework that puts us in contact with major scientific developments at international level."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today we are debating a motion for resolution on neurodegenerative diseases."
"The intention is actually for this to become a directive, and so next time, we should also be debating a directive on this subject."
"The diseases that we are discussing today - Alzheimer's disease, although Parkinson's disease is also referred to in the text - are diseases of the brain which constitute a major challenge for Europe."
"The long-term costs are set to soar and there is still a lot of research to do."
"Unfortunately, there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in Europe."
"Thus, with this motion for a resolution, we want to eliminate the duplicated research, bureaucracy and fragmentation."
"The Group of the United European Left - Nordic Green Left has tabled a motion for the research results to be made publicly available."
"I think this motion is a good one."
"Unfortunately, the wording is wrong, and I would therefore ask for it to be reworded so that it can be incorporated better."
"Essentially, there is a problem with regard to European patents."
"It would be good if the Commission, and the Council, too, could take up the subject of European patents in the areas of pharmaceuticals and bio-research and make it clear that we need this."
"In any case, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this motion for a resolution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should have been rapporteur on this dossier, so I feel a bit disappointed."
"However, I am happy that we are moving forward."
"It is not the time for an interinstitutional dispute."
"I am happy that the Council is prepared to move."
"I have a number of observations to make."
"Indeed, we hope here in Parliament that the Council will take on board the ideas in the resolutions that we are going to vote on tomorrow."
"I would emphasise the need to have the right balance between - like in climate change - mitigation and adaptation."
"Here, I am speaking about preventing this disease and understanding why it happens, what the factors are, so we can really prevent it effectively, because that is always the most effective and also the least expensive way of fighting disease."
"Is the joint programming initiative enough?"
"Well, not in the sense that this should become the norm, that in such major undertakings, working together should be the norm, not just a voluntary thing, but something that would really bind all Member States into working together effectively."
"Secondly, on financial priorities, the first question is: are we spending enough on these types of diseases?"
"We believe this is not the case and we would strongly encourage, within the forthcoming framework programmes, taking some money from big programmes like ITER, which the best scientists are telling us will pay off maybe in 60 years, and put some of that money into research into Alzheimer's disease and other diseases of a similar nature."
"I think that this is really needed."
"First of all, I would like to express my complete support with regard to the question that was asked by Mr Reul and, in particular, to point out that the fundamental issue - the fundamental political issue here - is precisely a matter of joint programming of research."
"What happened on the issue of joint programming on neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease, was that the rules changed in the middle of the process."
"We went from having a report to having a resolution, thereby taking away our codecision powers on this issue."
"We stopped being MEPs and instead became advisers."
"I would therefore like to know, at least, whether what we recommend will be taken into account or not."
"Programming research activities, in any area, is a political choice and not a technical choice and, in this regard, Parliament's role should be emphasised and strengthened."
"In my view, defining priorities that are political means that they should be scrutinised, should be transparent and should be democratic."
"What happened in relation to the joint decision and joint programming of research on Alzheimer's disease is a process that should not be repeated."
"Should it ever be repeated, please at least give us plenty of warning."
"I therefore hope that the last thing that can happen is that the decisions and the recommendations tabled by Parliament on this issue are not taken into consideration."
"Madam President, in my constituency of Northern Ireland, we currently have 16 000 people suffering from dementia."
"They, their families and their carers will welcome a proactive approach to tackling this disease, which can be so devastating to both sufferers and families."
"It is in areas like this that I believe it is good to see cooperation across European states."
"I believe that a coordinated approach to tackling disease can bring forward new evidence, new medical breakthroughs and, in time, hopefully improve treatment and cure."
"In the United Kingdom, we currently have just over 400 000 people suffering from Alzheimer's."
"This United Kingdom figure is likely to be something in the region of 750 000 people by 2025."
"It is therefore imperative that something is done to improve our diagnosis, treatment and prevention and social research into the welfare of patients and their families, particularly families who act as carers."
"A coordinated approach and a sharing of research are vital, as long as that research respects the sanctity of human life in all its forms."
"(PT) I welcome the initiatives and the actions undertaken at European level to combat neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease."
"The Member States have been developing research efforts in this field."
"It is important that cooperation among Member States is encouraged, to ensure increased coordination in terms of scientific research and technological development, and avoid fragmentation."
"Joint programming of research is a valuable tool for reducing fragmentation by involving, at European level, the Member States, the public sector and the private sector."
"This joint programming tool will be vital for the future of the European Research Area."
"Developing the European Research Area lies at the heart of the research policy of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, I am concerned about the implementation of this joint programming tool in terms of bureaucratic complexity and delays in administrative procedures."
"I would therefore like to ask what the plans are for using a process based on economy of scale, combining efficiency, simplification and fast-tracking of administrative procedures so as to promote excellence and to encourage collaboration at European level, as called for by the importance of this issue."
"Madam President, as a former health care professional of over 30 years, it was distressing to learn that Parliament would not be consulted regarding the Commission's new proposals on Alzheimer's disease."
"However, we must move on."
"As Europe's population becomes older, the impact of Alzheimer's will become deeper too."
"The number of Alzheimer's cases worldwide is predicted to grow from 35 million today to 107 million cases in 2050."
"One of the most harrowing aspects of Alzheimer's disease is the many people it affects apart from the patient."
"In Ireland, for example, there are 50 000 listed carers to cater for Ireland's 44 000 sufferers."
"This disease is often called a family disease because of the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline."
"The further role of the European Parliament in the fight against Alzheimer's disease should not be discounted."
"Any new direction by the EU should take account of Parliament's unique voice on the matter and should move to assist not just Alzheimer's sufferers but also the many carers who work to increase their quality of life."
"Madam President, obviously, coordinating research in this area is really important, and this is not just about Alzheimer's disease, as the term 'neurodegenerative' covers a multitude of diseases."
"Parliament actually has a very significant role to play in how that research will be done."
"I draw attention to the ongoing discussions between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the welfare of animals used in scientific experimentation."
"I am concerned - and hopeful, because of our rapporteur and the direction of the talks - that we continue to allow necessary research using animals in a way that is more welfare friendly than perhaps it is now."
"This is because we need research in this area in order to do the things that have been spoken about to prevent, and to treat people - and we may be amongst them ourselves in time - who unfortunately may be affected by these diseases."
"I hope we can have an early agreement at second reading on this very important directive."
"While we may not have had a great input into this particular issue, we will have had one into the ongoing research."
"(PL) Madam President, the question of the battle against this disease was raised - and credit should be given for this - during the French Presidency."
"It was said then that the EU should take action in this matter."
"It would be good if the next Presidency took up this matter and treated it with equal importance."
"It has already been said here that this problem affects millions of people and their families, who are all suffering."
"When we meet our constituents, we often hear this question: what does the EU do for the citizens of Europe?"
"What are you there for?"
"What are you responsible for?"
"What do you do?"
"It is just this type of question which should be the subject of efforts to build an image of authority and importance for the European Union."
"This is what our citizens need."
"Joint efforts to combat diseases of this kind must be a priority for the EU institutions."
"(EL) Madam President, I take the problem of combating neurodegenerative diseases - and especially Alzheimer's - extremely seriously."
"It is therefore very useful to have and achieve coordinated action between the Member States of the European Union in combating the causes and in addressing the problem of prevention and treatment and the consequences which such diseases have on patients, on society as a whole and on the public health of the citizens of the European Union."
"I believe that the priority and main approach should be in the field of prevention and not in the field of medication."
"The Member States should also be encouraged to set up monitoring centres for patients and their carers and to secure equal scientific participation by the Member States in this research endeavour by the European Union."
"Finally, the database created in agreement with the Council and the Member States must be under public and state ownership within the framework of national systems and the conclusions must be publicised at a public world forum."
"Finally, it is up to us to control the budget for this issue."
"(LT) Certainly, I agree that at this time, it is particularly important to devote attention to scientific research to ensure help for people suffering from Alzheimer's, as our European Union unites 27 Member States and not all states are equally able to offer assistance to Alzheimer sufferers."
"There are different health care systems, different social service systems, different support for those families with such a patient."
"Therefore, this scientific research is vitally important and we must concentrate and find, first of all, funding, coordinated work and coordinated activities."
"Secondly, it is very important that there is funding to implement that research and offer real support to people suffering from that disease, as well as their families."
"(DE) Madam President, I will be very brief."
"The importance of this has already been stated by several speakers."
"It is a disease that affects many people and that number is growing."
"It is even more essential for the Member States to work together, to combine forces, in order to be effective."
"As far as this goes, this is a right and sensible path to take."
"It is a shame that, when it comes to the procedures, we have difficulty getting Parliament involved."
"It is regrettable that this resolution had to be prepared at the last minute."
"However, if a good result is achieved in the end, then that is what is important."
"Madam President, Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases are dreadful."
"I believe that many of us who have seen a relative affected by Alzheimer's know how it can destroy a previously healthy person and how painful it is for family and other relatives, and I feel very strongly that we need to invest more resources in researching this terrible disease."
"It is clear that we need to take new steps to better coordinate our knowledge and research in Europe, and the Commission's pilot initiative aims to mobilise the best researchers we have to attempt to understand, cure and prevent both Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases."
"Within the framework of the current troika between France, the Czech Republic and now Sweden, we discussed at an early stage the importance of including Alzheimer's as a joint priority issue in the context of the work relating to public health."
"The French Presidency held a very important conference, as one of the honourable Members mentioned, and the Swedish Presidency held a conference in September on dignified ageing, with Alzheimer's as one of the items on the agenda."
"As I said, the Council intends to adopt conclusions on this on 3 December, and we will, of course, take into account the excellent resolution that you have produced and that you will vote on tomorrow."
"I am certain that the issue of Alzheimer's will come up again within the framework of the research programme and similar initiatives in the very near future, so thank you very much for raising this very important issue."
"A motion for a resolution to wind up the debate has been tabled under Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the proposal for a recommendation of the Commission on joint programming of research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases."
"The population's mental health is a vital issue for ensuring a decent quality of life."
"Diseases of this type are affecting an ever-increasing number of people in the EU."
"This is why efforts are required to combat the factors responsible for triggering these diseases."
"However, in order to combat these factors, they need to be identified through research."
"I believe that the pilot project for joint programming of research activities offers a definite advantage in terms of pooling the efforts for funding research, which will result in a more efficient use of the funds earmarked for research in this area."
"Furthermore, cooperation based on networks created by national research centres and the joint use of the required infrastructure are all the more beneficial, given that not all Member States have the necessary resources to undertake research activities at their own expense, even though they are facing a high number of cases involving neurodegenerative diseases."
"It will be paramount for the research results to be used to inform the population about the ways of supporting mental health, thereby helping reduce the number of patients and maintain the viability of national public health care systems."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's communication to Parliament offers an optimistic analysis of the expected benefits of cooperation in research among Member States and of the coordination that the Commission can carry out, in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme, with regard to neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer's disease in particular."
"The measures proposed in the communication only concern the principle of making better use of existing resources and programmes: the 'Health' Programme, the Seventh Framework Programme, the EU Action Plan on disabilities, the open method of coordination and the Statistical Programme."
"Will optimising our use of these resources be enough to achieve the expected results?"
"What coordination mechanisms is the Commission proposing that could not have been implemented before the communication?"
"What added value does it provide?"
"What new, practical measures is the Commission thinking of adopting to stimulate cooperation in research, in a situation where resources and teams already exist, although they are fragmented?"
"Will giving greater visibility to the issue and using existing instruments be enough to resolve it?"
"in writing. - I support this Resolution welcoming the proposed pilot project for joint programming of research activities in the field of neurodegenerative diseases."
"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease affect more than seven million citizens of the European Union."
"No cures are currently available for neurodegenerative diseases and knowledge about prevention, treatment, and identification of risk factors is very limited."
"Indeed, most of the research effort in the field of neurodegenerative diseases is carried out by Member States, with a relatively low level of transnational coordination, leading to fragmentation and limited sharing of knowledge and best practices among Member States."
"Joint programming could be highly valuable in reducing fragmentation of the research effort, leading as it would to a pooling of a critical mass of skills, knowledge and financial resources."
"However, Article 182(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon, which establishes measures necessary for the implementation of the European research area, could provide a more appropriate legal basis for future joint programming initiatives in the field of research."
"The Commission should consider using Article 182(5) as a legal basis for all future proposals for joint programming of research activities."
"Madam President, Alzheimer's disease is a confusing illness that changes the sufferer's world into somewhere unknown and perilous."
"Life becomes a highly dangerous 'now', where there are no past memories and lessons learnt to build a bridge of security to the present moment."
"Moreover, this fateful human tragedy is made all the worse by the fact that there is no known cure for the disease at this time."
"The illness also involves the suffering of close relatives."
"It is sometimes called a family illness, with relatives often suffering from chronic stress."
"The social impact is enormous and takes a heavy toll."
"As the population ages in Europe, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are becoming more and more a public health issue: there are now more than seven million patients, and that number is expected to double in the next decade."
"Medical science, however, still does not even fully understand the causes of the disease."
"There are some promising findings from research, but we need coordinated efforts if we are to achieve a breakthrough."
"In order to compile the data from the research of private and public organisations and the Member States and coordinate their innovations, we need Community programming: that way, there is hope that more effective prevention, diagnoses and treatment with regard to these diseases will become a reality as soon as possible in practical care work."
"I am convinced that the people who are struggling with neurodegenerative diseases - the patients, relatives and carers - will vigorously support any collaborative attempts to look for new ways to deal with these conditions."
"It is just these sorts of projects that tell our citizens why we are here today at all: they justify the Union's entire existence."
"I agree with my colleague, Mr Reul, that procedure and competence take second place when one is actually headed in the right direction."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the summer, the Commission adopted the Council's recommendation urging the Member States of the EU to engage in joint programming of research into neurodegenerative diseases."
"This is important if even better use is to be made of the limited resources for research."
"We need to remember, however, that, in addition to research, Europe needs a more extensive action programme on dementia."
"Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved a written statement calling on the Commission to draft an action plan on Alzheimer's disease."
"Parliament's statement emphasised the importance of four issues: developments in research, early diagnosis, improved quality of life for patients and their carers, and the status of the Alzheimer's associations."
"I would like to remind everyone that the programme is urgent and the Commission needs to get started on the action that Parliament has asked it to take."
"In our increasingly elderly society, the number of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or senile dementia will continue to increase."
"In order to be as prepared for this as possible, we need to create better research structures and make better use of the existing facilities."
"The planned pilot project in this area is an ideal starting point for interlinking the current research efforts better."
"However, prevention is also important alongside providing the best possible care for those affected."
"The Member States need to step up their information campaigns regarding an active lifestyle."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance in accordance with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure."
"(RO) I wish to draw your attention to the political situation in Romania and to the impact this is having on Romania's relations with the Community's institutions."
"In October 2009, the Social Democratic Party quit the government."
"The newly created opposition brought down the government with a motion of censure, rejected the first new government proposed and refused to take part in negotiations on the formation of a government."
"As a result, Romania cannot fulfil the obligations it has to the European Commission, the World Bank and the IMF, in terms of the credit it has borrowed."
"This is the reason why we are in the situation where some of the commitments undertaken with regard to reforming the state cannot be fulfilled in time."
"The political instability in Romania was mainly triggered by the political actions of the Social Democratic Party."
"The reasons behind this are not only electoral."
"The aim in the medium term is to halt the reforms concerning administration, the rule of law, justice and anti-corruption."
"(PT) Last month, the regions of Europe were in the spotlight."
"The European Week of Regions and Cities consolidated the position of the regions as a fundamental part of the solution in the European response to global challenges."
"Such was the conclusion of President Barroso, Commissioner Samecki and the hundreds of debates that took place, leaving no room for doubt."
"In more specific terms, holding the important meeting of the Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions of Europe, which saw Members of the European Parliament attend for the first time, also represented a milestone in regional policy in favour of European integration."
"Global challenges and European responses represent a perfect opportunity for a new strategy for the outermost regions."
"These regions, such as the Azores, beyond the permanent difficulties that we are all used to hearing about, offer a range of possibilities that provide clear opportunities for us to make progress and to give Europe a distinct advantage in new areas that are vital to our responses to global challenges."
"The President of the Commission therefore needs to put a definitive end to the palace coup that the Commission's 'non-paper' suggests was being prepared while we, MEPs and European citizens, were supporting ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and its importance in defending territorial cohesion ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, EUR 465 million has been allocated to the LEADER funding programme in Ireland for the period 2007 to 2013."
"However, just two years into the five-year programme, only 18% of project funding has been spent because the local development companies who manage the projects have found themselves caught up in red tape and excessive bureaucracy."
"There are reams of pages of rules, accompanied by an extensive inspection procedure."
"Part of the problem is that interpretation of the myriad rules can vary from one inspector to another."
"The other part of the problem is that some of the rules are mindless in the first place."
"One project worker said that he spent 50% of his time recording what he was doing in the other 50%."
"Of course we need accountability, but it has reached a stage where there is now a disincentive for local groups to apply for funding."
"Millions will go unspent, which would be criminal given the need to kick-start our economies with whatever funding is available."
"We need common sense in Dublin, and we need to ensure that the European Commission ensures that this happens."
"(FR) Madam President, President Václav Havel's speech to our House highlighted one of the fundamental principles of the European Union: solidarity among human beings."
"We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, that wall of shame."
"Following 9 November 1989, we were told that humanity would finally be set free."
"Democracy and human rights were supposed to extend to the entire planet, knocking down walls, removing barriers between peoples."
"However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent?"
"The walls erected in Ceuta and Melilla, for example, to ward off the arrival of men and women fleeing war, poverty and global warming, the walls stretching from the detention centres, the gates of our cities as far as the Libyan desert, via Lampedusa, where even children are locked up in the name of the Return Directive."
"Let us knock down the walls of fortress Europe, let us build bridges, not walls ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we view some of the events taking place in the world today with greater sensitivity."
"Today we are quite able to make a realistic assessment of events in Russia."
"In earlier times, we experienced any events in Soviet Union as ideological pressure but now we discuss trade under conditions of absolute individual freedom."
"With the approach of winter, there is mounting anxiety, of course, over what will happen with supplies of gas from Russia via Ukraine."
"Studies of the January crisis clearly show how different the situation was in the western and eastern parts of Europe."
"They will lead to a more careful approach to the preparation of crisis scenarios."
"It is important to find the best possible solution to contractual relationships at the international level and, at the same time, to provide more information in situations of this kind."
"The high costs of technical measures also oblige us to consider carefully whether to finance them from the public purse or on the basis of European directives."
"The question is how much gas we actually need to store and how to finance it."
"It is important to distinguish between a real crisis and a business matter in relation to gas and at what point senior political figures should enter the negotiations and what the market should control."
"We must avoid being drawn into excessive bureaucratic interference."
"Madam President, today the EU Commission is demanding of the Irish Government savage cuts in Ireland's budget, involving the slashing of public services and the living standards of working people, possibly even for pensioners and the unemployed."
"The Commission should know, however, that it is conspiring with the Irish Government in a lie to pretend that the money given to bail out the banks is not State aid while, at the same time, hammering the public sector."
"However, Irish workers and community activists are fighting back."
"Tens of thousands marched in protest last Friday; thousands of workers marched in Dublin today; and on 24 November, a public sector workers' strike is scheduled, in order to stop these attacks."
"In view of the seriousness of the situation, that should now be upgraded to a 24-hour general strike to bring down this appalling government, which has no mandate for these policies, and to halt the policy of the Commission and of the Irish Government to slash and burn the living standards and services of working people."
"Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly's attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK."
"This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years."
"This was the case until the EU got itself involved."
"As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business."
"But it gets worse."
"While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death."
"This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out."
"(RO) The President of the Atra Kadisha World Organisation, Grand Rabbi David Schmidl, asked me to be, and I quote, 'their spokesman in the European Union' where they would like a committee to be set up to deal with any complaints concerning the desecration of the grounds in cemeteries."
"The Geneva Treaty should also be updated and improved."
"I do not wish to give specific examples and make accusations against anyone, but I have seen with my own eyes photographs depicting Jewish cemeteries where horses and cattle graze on graves."
"I have also seen images of tombstones turned into basic toilets, as well as old Jewish catacombs dating back 2 000 years where the sacred human remains are in an appalling state."
"The remaining cemeteries have been invaded by bulldozers with excavators digging up relics."
"This is a great affront to God."
"The Holocaust is a tragic scar on the face of mankind and it must never be repeated, not even on a miniature scale."
"I myself made a pilgrimage to Auschwitz with my children and believe me, I know very well what I am talking about."
"These people are asking us in the European Parliament to defend all vestiges of all religions, not only Jewish vestiges, but also Romanian vestiges in Europe."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Madam President, our dear neighbours, the Austrians, have been polluting one of Hungary's most beautiful rivers, the Rába, for years."
"Two weeks ago, we could see a layer of foam half a metre thick on the river, clearly highlighting this fact."
"However, not content with polluting our river, our dear neighbours now want to pollute our air as well with the incinerator planned for construction in Heiligenkreuz."
"They want to build an incinerator in Heiligenkreuz 300 metres from the Hungarian border, which could incinerate almost ten times the volume of refuse produced in Burgenland annually, and all of this with the European Union's assistance."
"This planned investment infringes Directive 2008/98/EC."
"This is why I am calling on the European Commission not to approve any EU assistance for the construction of the incinerator in Heiligenkreuz."
"(EL) Madam President, the major challenge facing mankind in terms of climate change is how we can stop building up more carbon in the atmosphere and start storing it in the ground."
"Given that it is impossible for us to stop emitting carbon gases over the next 50 years, increasing carbon storage in the ground is our only hope and should be the priority of policies to combat this problem."
"In order to achieve this, we need to increase plant cover."
"As part of this effort, China has planted 54 million hectares of trees, with impressive repercussions on the availability of drinking water and agricultural productivity."
"Similarly, tree-planting programmes in Rwanda have resulted in such an increase in the flow of rivers towards the capital that it can now be powered solely by a hydroelectric plant."
"In the same direction, the US House of Representatives has passed legislation under which the USA will pay USD 5 billion to deal with deforestation."
"For these reasons, the stand taken by the Council, which not only has failed to commit to a specific amount in financing for developing countries, but also has failed to say anything about financing to maintain the world's forests, is unacceptable at a time when there is no uniform policy or coordination at European Union level on the protection of forest eco-systems at risk in southern Europe."
"Nonetheless, I trust that the European Union's negotiations in Copenhagen will pro-actively support global efforts to put an end to deforestation and to increase tree-planting."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate on neurodegenerative diseases permits me to introduce the problem of sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to bring to Parliament's knowledge the fact that 150 people throughout Italy have begun a hunger strike as a show of support for Salvatore Usala, an ALS sufferer who has stopped eating in order to protest against the Italian Government's indifference to the problems experienced by patients and their family members who are living with this terrible disease."
"This campaign is also being supported by members of the Italian Parliament, such as Antonietta Farina, and by our colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Rinaldi."
"Above all, however, this is a struggle that ALS patients and their families face every day, in a dignified and quiet way, as part of the tragedy of having a terrible disease."
"ALS affects young people but there is no cure for it; and yet, the Italian state is very attentive to everything bar patients and their families."
"Carrying out research is a challenge for Europe but it is up to the Member States to guarantee patients a dignified existence."
"(FR) Madam President, I, for my part, would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine."
"Currently, the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation, and I would like to share a number of concerns with you."
"Firstly, what is the relationship between the risks and benefits?"
"At the moment, the benefits are few, since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths - nowhere near as many as seasonal flu, in any case."
"With regard to the risks, on the other hand, we have enough time to consider this aspect, and I would like, in particular, to address the problem of adjuvants."
"I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd: in the United States, the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited, but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain squalene."
"The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype."
"I therefore think that more harmonisation may be required."
"(PL) Madam President, the scandalous judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which orders a cross to be removed from the wall of an Italian school and EUR 5 000 compensation to be paid to one of its pupils for so-called moral damages, has aroused concern not only in Italy, but also in other countries of the European Union."
"The cross is a symbol both of the Christian religion and of the history and tradition of Europe."
"Removal of the cross by administrators is the first step to the cultural 'harakiri' of Europe."
"Unfortunately, pragmatism of this kind is turning into a consistent plan to combat European values."
"It is only necessary to recall the removal of references to Christianity in the most important documents of the European Union."
"We need to return to the original ideas and concepts of the founding fathers of the European Union, who were Christian democrats."
"Therefore, I appeal to the President of the European Parliament to organise a suitable debate, which will end with a resolution on the subject of the freedom of religious practice in Europe and on the fundamental values on which the European Union is based."
"(PT) In Portugal, and particularly in the north, the economic and social crisis is getting worse and unemployment continues to rise, making this region one of the poorest in the European Union, as recent Eurostat documents show."
"Large companies continue to announce that they are scaling back their activities and cutting jobs."
"One of the most serious examples is that of Qimonda, in Vila do Conde, which is in the process of making 600 workers redundant, in addition to around 1 000 that were already made redundant last year."
"This effectively represents the destruction of one of the largest and most important companies in a strategic industrial sector for technological development."
"We cannot accept this situation."
"It is unacceptable that neither the European Commission nor the Council has found an alternative to the dismantling of this microchip and nanotechnology industry."
"It is appalling that they remain apathetic in the face of the worsening unemployment and increasing suffering in vast regions of the European Union."
"Madam President, I was due to talk about the pressures unlimited EU migration is putting on the UK."
"Forgive me for raising a pressing matter recently brought to my attention."
"As a coordinator on the Regional Development Committee and an MEP for Wales, it was with great concern that I received a leaked copy of a draft communication of the European Commission entitled A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe: reforming the budget, changing Europe."
"The document proposes a major refocusing of the EU's spending priorities, placing greater emphasis on - and I paraphrase - a global Europe, and less on agriculture and transfers towards well-off regions."
"This will have a huge impact on British agriculture and structural fund programmes in this current cycle."
"As a net contributor, the United Kingdom will be forced to give up much more of the rebate, whilst other countries will be the main beneficiaries."
"11.8% of funds earmarked for the UK under the cohesion policy go to the poorest regions in Wales."
"I am very concerned that this leaked document may have consequences for transitional payments at the end of the current programme in 2013."
"It is time the people of the UK had a referendum on its relationship with this place so they can be the people who decide their destiny, not unelected bureaucrats."
"(HU) As we celebrate here in the European Union so enthusiastically the collapse of the Berlin Wall and Communism with it, we might well ask what has become of the former Communist leaders."
"I will tell you."
"They are the ones who have become the most enthusiastic capitalists, neo-liberals and champions of the order of world domination."
"On their return to power, they have done away with everything that was good in Communism - and let us admit it, there were a few things - such as security of employment and social security."
"However, they have brought back the most hideous aspects, brutality and terror."
"On the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution, which had made possible the collapse of the Berlin Wall, people were shot in the eye."
"At the moment in Hungary, as we speak in the Chamber and celebrate the collapse of Communism, these Communist comrades are holding 16 political prisoners in detention."
"I will only celebrate when the political prisoners have been released, when the victims shot in the eye have received justice and when these Communists end this bloodshed and are consigned to the dustbin of history."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to speak about the proposition for reform of the European Union budget after 2013."
"Is it true that this proposition means a substantial reduction in regional funds?"
"Does the European Commission realise that this will radically weaken EU regional and agricultural policy?"
"The proposition to weaken poorer regions of the EU in order to fund the battle against climate change may hardly be called rational or logical."
"It would affect the majority of the EU's 271 regions."
"It is surely possible to help poor regions of the EU while, at the same time, using good projects to tackle climate change, reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy and modern technological solutions."
"Does the Commission intend, when introducing the proposition for budget reform, to by-pass regional and local authorities in the distribution of funds?"
"In this way, recognition is being taken away from territorial authorities in matters which are of great significance for them."
"(LT) The European Union has committed itself to establishing an effective mechanism to prevent child sex abuse."
"Eight months have passed since this particularly important topic was discussed in a plenary session of the European Parliament."
"We should welcome the fact that since then, the Council has begun to debate a draft directive that aims to improve the legislation in this area."
"However, time does not stand still and now and again painful events remind us that there is still insufficient protection for our children."
"Sadly, the consequences of these crimes are devastating and long-lasting."
"The sexual exploitation of children and the dissemination of pornography are often transnational in nature, and can therefore only be effectively prevented with international cooperation."
"We must plan for criminal responsibility of new forms of child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse that are not envisaged in current legislation."
"I would like to draw the attention of the new Parliament to this important problem and call on the Council to speed up the discussion of the draft proposals."
"(SL) Madam President, I am pleased with the progress in relations between the governments of Croatia and Slovenia, which have taken a major political step forward, and with the increase in maturity which both governments have exhibited."
"The border arbitration agreement which they have signed sends out a positive message and sets an excellent example to the other countries in the region."
"However, I note with regret that, only a few days after signing this agreement, the Prime Minister of Croatia also signed a unilateral statement which places a one-sided interpretation on the recently signed agreement."
"We should not do anything which sows the seeds of doubt or spreads uncertainty, because that is not the way to move forward."
"Unilateral statements and unilateral actions are never a good choice, nor do they send out the right message."
"Such action does not promote credibility, it does not encourage the necessary mutual trust and it raises doubts about the seriousness of our intentions and the reality and viability of the agreement."
"If we are to succeed on this front, we need to make major efforts and strengthen trust amongst ourselves at home, amongst our neighbours and throughout the region."
"I call on the government of Croatia to refrain from fresh unilateral actions and I ask the Prime Minister to show political courage and determination instead and to help us overcome the impasses of the past."
"(PL) I would like to draw attention to the fact that we were alarmed last week by the situation, or by the information, that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has asked the European Commission to settle the debt owed to Gazprom by Ukraine."
"In view of this, I would like to ask if such a request has been received."
"Does the European Commission intend to make the European Union pay this debt?"
"If the answers to the first two questions are affirmative, then on what grounds would the Commission do this?"
"Madam President, I would also like you to note that I am the only Member who has not used all of his speaking time."
"Madam President, I have asked for the floor today to inform you of a rather disturbing fact that has come to my knowledge whilst on a visit to Washington DC as part of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs delegation."
"On the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection (SWIFT, PNR), the United States is expanding its National Security Agency data-collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country."
"How can the US pretend to respect the right to privacy when it is building an enormous eavesdropping agency - and how can we just sit to one side and let that happen?"
"It is our responsibility to raise awareness of this gross abuse of power and violation of our basic rights."
"I hope you will join me in informing our voters and the citizens in our countries about this through declarations and articles to the press."
"Madam President, in the last two months, I have suffered victimisation by the UK Labour regime, including withdrawal of my House of Commons pass, refusal to allow me to enter the Sellafield nuclear processing plant - despite my position on a subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - and the refusal of the Citizens' Advice Bureau to sell me an information database openly advertised for sale to all other MEPs."
"Madam President, would you agree that political discrimination is not only unlawful but is also an attack not just on me, but also on the functionality of this place and, most important of all, on the voters and the entire democratic process?"
"(PT) The investigation conducted by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work provides some worrying conclusions, stating that generalised unemployment is having negative consequences for the safety and health of workers."
"According to the study, which involved 27 000 respondents in the 27 Member States, six in every 10 workers feel that the economic crisis and increased unemployment are making working conditions worse."
"Seventy-five per cent of respondents claimed that the worsening of their health is attributable to the work they do."
"This information bears out the data from a Eurostat study, which shows that 27 million workers suffer accidents or are affected by occupational diseases and that 137 million workers are exposed to risks on a daily basis."
"Just this week, yet another serious work-related accident killed five Portuguese workers in Andorra."
"This situation requires a rapid response from the European Union and the Member States."
"This response should involve creating jobs with rights, promoting work and workers, and penalising employers that cut back on prevention and protection measures for workers in order to boost their profits."
"There was confusion there in assigning the microphone."
"I should have given the floor to Mr Teixeira."
"I probably pronounced your name wrongly and that caused the confusion."
"(PT) The European Commission recently tabled a draft communication on budgetary reform, which included references to cohesion policy that are causing anxiety and confusion, especially where the outermost regions are concerned."
"A debate on the Community budget needs to be held urgently, but we believe that the financial framework after 2013 should be based on solidarity and territorial cohesion, this being vital for regions such as Madeira, which face permanent difficulties and which therefore need permanent support."
"The intention to alter the focus of cohesion policy from the present regionally based approach to an approach based on value added sectors is unacceptable."
"Such a change could lead to the abolition of Objective 2, which currently benefits around two thirds of the European regions."
"It is incomprehensible that the Commission intends to switch the allocation of funds from a regional to a national basis, or even at European level, rejecting the criterion of proximity that has always underpinned cohesion policy."
"It is unacceptable for a Member State's long-standing membership of the EU to be a variable in the formula for calculating structural fund allocations, dividing up Member States into new and old, which will render Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty meaningless as regards the outermost regions' access to structural funds."
"(FR) Madam President, as an MEP from Normandy, I would like to draw the Commission's and Parliament's attention to the proposals on offshore Natura 2000 sites, which the French Government has just submitted to the European authorities."
"These proposals exclude the Antifer dyke situated near Etretat, but compensate for it by enlarging the perimeter to 12 nautical miles."
"This decision eases the way for Poweo to install a methane terminal at Antifer and restricts a project to create an offshore wind farm off Fécamp, despite the support shown for this project by local elected representatives, the population and even fishermen."
"A scientific and consistent proposal has been drafted for the region and has the backing of local operators."
"Under this proposal there will be six miles of zoning along the entire coastline, including Antifer."
"I have three questions: how much progress has the Commission made in examining the zoning proposals?"
"Does it endorse them even though they go against scientific opinions and against the social, economic and cultural activities of the region?"
"And, with the Copenhagen Summit approaching, can Europe reasonably endorse a decision that promotes gas at the expense of the development of renewable energies?"
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the health situation in Ukraine."
"Available data shows that over a million cases of influenza have already been reported, including several dozen cases of the AH1N1 virus."
"Ukraine has requested international aid and, in particular, for vaccines, medicines, disinfectants, masks, gloves and laboratory supplies."
"We know that the Commission has set in motion a special mechanism for civil aid, a monitoring and information centre to coordinate the aid given to Ukraine by EU countries."
"What is this coordination like?"
"What aid is being given?"
"How is the monitoring system working?"
"I think that public opinion would like to receive an answer to these questions."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two decades have elapsed since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the 20th anniversary of which we have marked, and since the Iron Curtain was torn down."
"Nevertheless, there has been little to show for these 20 years as we see that in many countries liberated from Communism, we have not yet managed to free ourselves definitively from the habits of the former system."
"In the autumn of 2006, the police completely disregarded the right to free assembly on Budapest's streets, as well as the right to a fair trial."
"The victims of this are still looking, in vain, for justice and the opportunity to exercise their rights."
"In March this year in Budapest, calls for the prime minister to step down were again met with detentions and inhumane, humiliating treatment."
"It can still happen in the European Union even today that people are not allowed to use their own language in the land of their birth - like in Slovakia, for instance - or exercise the rights granted by democracy, if the fate of a minority has been imposed on them by history."
"Take also Romania, where they are in the process of putting up a statue to a former general who gave the order to fire among the participants in demonstrations."
"(PT) The current economic crisis leads to job insecurity."
"Economic difficulties lead workers to accept, sometimes blindly, job offers that eschew labour laws and the supervision of law enforcement and government authorities."
"Unfortunately, we have already witnessed in the European Union several cases of exploitation of labour that often genuinely constitute slavery, whether of European citizens, or non-European citizens."
"Moreover, we have seen an unusually high number of deaths of migrant workers, including many compatriots of mine, many Portuguese citizens, even when legally employed."
"These accidents have happened in the workplace and especially in the civil construction sector."
"The European Union and its bodies, as well as all the Member States, are therefore urged and called upon to cooperate forcefully and effectively, so as to prevent these situations."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to sound the alarm bell regarding the low rate of planning and payment of the ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund appropriations."
"We are still very far from having planned half of the available funds."
"With regard to the payments, only 9.62% of the EUR 347 billion for regional policy has been paid to the project leaders."
"All the countries are affected, some even more so than others."
"Spain, Luxembourg and Sweden must do their level best to catch up with the countries that are in the lead when it comes to the payment of European funds, such as, for example, the Baltic countries, Ireland and Slovenia."
"The European Union's regional policy is one of the most useful policies for our fellow citizens."
"Indeed, it guarantees economic, social and territorial cohesion through the cofinancing of practical, and very often crucial, projects."
"I therefore appeal to the national management authorities to get involved."
"At the same time, I feel that it is crucial, in a period of economic crisis, for European rules to be adapted to the major problems."
"(PL) Madam President, today we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe."
"There was a very appropriate and worthy ceremony, in which Mr Havel and Mr Buzek took part, and there are exhibitions in the European Parliament."
"That is how it should be, but the European institutions should not restrict themselves to such events only once in many years."
"This should be present in our history - the truth about these changes should be present in our educational activities, and it should be initiated by the European institutions."
"We need a common history textbook of those times, which would show how Europe united, so that the children in our schools can have access to that truth and that knowledge."
"On the other hand, many examples can be given of money spent unnecessarily."
"The British organisation Open Europe says that EUR 7 million was spent on financing a blog about a donkey travelling around the Netherlands."
"It is time we spent money for Europe more effectively."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid we must conclude the one-minute speeches under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure at this point."
"According to Rule 150, we can conduct this type of debate for no more than 30 minutes."
"These speeches have now gone on for almost 40 minutes, because, unfortunately, many speakers did not keep to one minute."
"I tried to give priority to those who did not have a chance to speak in either of the last two debates and I hope you felt it was fairly balanced."
"We still have four more debates this evening and, as you know, the sitting must close at midnight at the latest."
"Third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Tanja Fajon, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement - C7-0112/2009 -."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barrot, and all of you attending here today, the European Parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"That is also the core idea that has guided us throughout the preparation of the report."
"I would like to express my compliments, in particular, to the shadow rapporteurs and members of Parliament, as without their support I would not have been able to achieve this result."
"Likewise, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their collaborative efforts which will form the firm bedrock of future cooperation in this area, especially once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified, as that will enable Parliament to adopt any necessary measures through the codecision procedure."
"The citizens of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long."
"They have fewer rights today, as regards free travel, than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia."
"What young people from the countries of the Western Balkans know about Europe, or America for that matter, today is what they learn from the internet and television."
"As I come from Slovenia, I can recall that it was actually the Slovene Presidency which initiated the process of visa regime liberalisation in early 2008, five years after the signing of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which guarantees an unambiguous European perspective for the population of the Western Balkans."
"I am pleased to welcome the Commission's proposal for the abolition of the visa requirement for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and I am particularly pleased to welcome Slovenia's initiative, which has received strong support from the Member States and which allows the citizens of these countries to start travelling freely to the countries of the Schengen area from 19 December."
"1 January 2010 would have entailed logistical difficulties, as the Christmas and New Year holiday period is exactly the time when many citizens of these countries want to travel to visit their relations living in the Member States."
"The abolition of visas will make an enormous contribution to the process of regional cooperation and the overcoming of ethnic divisions and will also help to build cultural, social, economic and political bridges."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the abolition of visas for the three countries I have mentioned is a very positive step in the right direction."
"However, I should point out that the countries which were omitted from the visa abolition framework should be allowed to join it as soon as possible or, rather, as soon as they are ready to do so."
"Naturally, I am talking about Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania."
"We cannot allow them to become ever more isolated, at a time when their neighbouring countries are enjoying the possibility of unlimited travel into the European Union."
"Of course, they need to be prepared for visa abolition and I do not mean to suggest here that we need to lower our criteria."
"What we want to do is to send a clear message to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania: We are waiting for you; you must urge your governments to fulfil their side of the bargain."
"We, on the other hand, will do everything in our power to ensure that there are no delays in decision making on the European Union's side."
"I can safely say that this approach has met with the broad support of two committees, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which is my parent committee."
"I would also add that, tomorrow after the vote, I will ask for the floor in order to deliver a special political statement, a common statement of Parliament and the Council, which strongly supports the abolition of the visa requirement for all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"In this statement, on which we shall vote separately tomorrow, we will both welcome 19 December, the date when the visa requirement will be abolished for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and call on the European Commission to prepare, as soon as possible, a proposal that the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be abolished as soon as they have met the relevant criteria."
"We, on the other hand, undertake to deal with this proposal under an expedited procedure."
"I would like us to set a clear date for the abolition of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, although I am aware of the demanding nature of the procedures involved."
"I hope that the summer of 2010 will prove to be a realistic date for the abolition of the visa requirement for these two countries."
"Just to conclude. We should not forget Kosovo, either, if we do not want it to become a black hole on the map ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Let me just conclude: The European Union has a political responsibility to finalise the process of visa liberalisation and tomorrow, I expect Parliament's broad support in this regard."
"Madam President, it is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency could not be represented here tonight in the person of a Minister, as it would very much have liked."
"I understand that the Council Presidency was not invited and was told there was no need for it to be here."
"I would like to remind the House that the Swedish Presidency has driven and supported the process of visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans from the very beginning."
"We should - and I know my colleague Tanja Fajon, the rapporteur, agrees with me - have a chance to thank the Council Presidency, for we owe it the joint declaration between Parliament and the Council, supported by the Commission, which is unique in the history of this institution."
"I would like an explanation, though maybe not here and now, of why the Council Presidency could not attend, and I would like it to go on the record that the Minister could not be here because no invitation was made."
"I have been informed that the Council Presidency was invited, but it had scheduling problems and so is unable to be here."
"However, I will look into the matter."
"Madam President, I wish to reply to the question put by Mrs Corazza Bildt and to say that the Swedish Presidency has indeed been very active in this process which, as Mrs Fajon has just ably explained, enables us to offer a number of citizens from the Member States concerned, and young people in particular, the possibility of engaging and interacting more with this Europe, which they are, at times, rather unfamiliar with."
"It is true that this proposal represents an historic stage in the development of European short-stay visa policy within the context of our relations with the countries of the Western Balkans."
"Moreover, the Commission welcomes the adoption of this legislative proposal by both the European Parliament and the Council."
"Everyone is aware of its major political impact and of the sensitive nature of the issue, which affects all of the citizens of the countries concerned."
"I understand Parliament's position."
"I would like, in this connection, to confirm the Commission's strong commitment to monitor closely the fulfilment, by all of the countries concerned, of all the criteria laid down in the road map."
"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had already been the subject of a positive assessment; the dialogue was therefore concluded with that country."
"In October, Serbia and Montenegro hosted missions led by the Commission, in association with the experts from the Member States, and those missions confirmed that all of the criteria of the respective road maps had been fulfilled properly."
"We are going to follow the same method for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Despite the very significant progress made over the last few months, Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the necessary reforms requested in the road map to justify the exemption of the visa requirement."
"However, as you just said, Mrs Fajon, it is already very encouraging for them to hear that their neighbours already have this option of being exempted from the visa requirement, and I can confirm to you that I personally will do everything in my power to ensure that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can obtain this visa exemption as quickly as possible, as you want."
"I invite Parliament, which, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, will be a colegislator in the field of visas, to support the structured method of dialogue on the liberalisation of visas, which is the method followed by the Commission, because a different approach would cause confusion without really changing the visa regime."
"It would create false hopes and would be liable to slow down the efforts made by the countries in question to implement the reforms required by the road maps."
"At this stage, we are keeping Albania and Bosnia in Annex I to the regulation, while reaffirming the European Union's commitment to help these two countries meet the criteria in their road map, and thus to be exempted from the visa requirement in accordance with the procedures in force."
"In this context the Commission supports the text of the joint political declaration, which confirms this strong commitment by the Union to implement as quickly as possible the second stage of this visa liberalisation process for the citizens of Albania and Bosnia, Mrs Fajon."
"There you have it, Madam President."
"I believe that this is a very important point that shows the Balkan States just how attentive Europe is to their expectations and desires."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, the commitment supported in the Fajon report and backed by the proposed Council and Parliament declaration is a far-sighted one."
"It is to give visa-free travel to all the people of the Western Balkans."
"This is not solely a generous and altruistic move."
"It is also hard-headed and shrewd, since security in the widest sense of the word will be promoted and advanced."
"People who are free, and free to travel, tend to be committed to peaceful solutions and less prey to introverted nationalism which is a security threat."
"Who can fail to be moved by the images on the screens outside this Chamber and all the celebrations we have had this week marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall?"
"While these obstacles cannot be compared to the Wall, they are still a barrier to the free communication and wider horizons that promote understanding and tolerance."
"Our insistence on an inclusive approach should include a fair result by the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement."
"I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for her hard work and the way that she has included all the nuances in every twist and turn of her deliberations over the last two months."
"I do also thank the Council, and especially the Swedish Presidency, for their work in helping us to get agreement on the declaration, which confirms the definite aim of visa liberalisation for all the citizens of the Western Balkans as soon as possible - and we hope that this will be during 2010, because the absence of a reasonable commonality in the target dates for achieving this free travel is divisive and creates instability."
"We also have made a commitment, in the Fajon report, to working for a visa facilitation and visa liberalisation road map for Kosovo similar to those for the other Western Balkan countries."
"I would also like to add the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom - which is not included in the present decision of the EU Schengen zone by virtue, of course, of not being a member - will also shortly follow the same path."
"I always feel a certain schizophrenia when working on these matters on the Schengen projects because I am a British MEP, but it obviously would be a good thing both for the European Union and for the Western Balkan region if the UK were to follow suit as quickly as possible."
"I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fajon, the rapporteur."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the PPE Group is committed to speeding up visa liberalisation for all countries in the Western Balkans by July 2010."
"We welcome and support the proposal to grant visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia by Christmas this year."
"We understand the plea of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania - a young generation which has been locked in and left out and feels imprisoned."
"To them we say: 'We are on your side; we are ready when you are ready'."
"It is regrettable that the slow start by the authorities in Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina left them behind."
"The responsibility for any delays rests with them."
"We exhort them to meet the benchmarks as soon as possible."
"We know that the Commission is helping in that process."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that I am saddened that it took us three months of negotiations for the PPE Group to convince the political Left in this House to operate according to the treaties."
"Is that so complicated?"
"Finally, it too has understood that the European Parliament is not above the law."
"With all respect to my distinguished colleagues, I have to denounce a non-constructive attitude."
"There are no short cuts."
"There is no abracadabra."
"We are not here to score points."
"We are here to obtain results for the citizens of the Balkans."
"Let me be clear, any provisional mixed intermediary status does not accelerate the process and does not put pressure on the Commission or the Council."
"It definitely does not send any strong political message."
"I would like to conclude by saying that I experienced the siege of Sarajevo and the shelling for a year and a half."
"To my friends there, I am saying that I am committed."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, until 2008 and the Slovenian Presidency, not enough progress was made on what the Commissioner rightly called an historic move towards visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans."
"As Mrs Ludford said, very correctly, there are deep practical considerations as to why this is important for us and why this is not just a reactive measure."
"So, on behalf of the Socialist and Democrat Group, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for the careful and painstaking work she has undertaken to move the European Union towards this ultimate goal of abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"This has been done with the shadow rapporteurs and with the Commission and Council, and it should be commended."
"While it is clear that many see visa liberalisation as having great benefits on both sides; it is also the case that we have to take the whole House with us on the question of the road map and of ensuring that fundamental reforms are carried out in all of these countries in order to gain confidence for a truly decent visa liberalisation regime."
"The task for our rapporteur was to make a breakthrough on visa liberalisation while taking the House with her."
"She has done this in the form of the declaration that she negotiated with the Council."
"The declaration looks to visa liberalisation for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, to an acceleration of the liberalisation regime for Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to a sensitive compromise on the question of Kosovo."
"For all these reasons, my group supports this report and hopes it will gain widespread support in the House."
"Madam President, I would first like to join with the previous speaker in expressing my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Mrs Fajon and Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also to the shadow rapporteurs."
"We have succeeded in presenting a proposal demanding that the Commission and the Council come up with an overall package for all the people of the entire Western Balkans, leaving no one out."
"I very much hope - and I am addressing Commissioner Barrot in this regard - that you can convince the Council that the goal of visa liberalisation should also apply to Kosovo, so the dialogue will now begin, and so that visa liberalisation will also be achieved for Bosnia and Albania by no later than the middle of next year."
"I would prefer it to be sooner."
"I would like to make one thing clear."
"Of course, it is a matter of implementation, but I have heard that everything has not yet been implemented in Serbia."
"I would like to know what you think about this."
"It is important to implement everything."
"I would like to thank everyone involved and I hope that all of the people ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, my fellow countrymen from East Germany obtained the freedom to travel."
"A few years later, Slobodan Milošević arbitrarily jeopardised and then took away the freedom of travel for Serbs and then for all other countries in the region."
"How often since 2000 have we in this House, in declarations and in public debates, wished for the freedom of travel - visa-free travel - for the countries of South-Eastern Europe."
"We know that the EU cannot achieve this alone, as the national governments need to agree to it."
"We need to overcome the anxieties in our population."
"Criminals are everywhere - they do not need a visa!"
"They cross borders without a visa."
"That is therefore not something that we should be concerned about."
"It is about the young generation, who, with the help of visa-free travel, can finally go wherever they want to."
"We are therefore very pleased that the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will now finally be able to travel freely again."
"How wonderful!"
"There is still a hint of sadness in that Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo cannot yet join them, but in December, we expect the Commission to acknowledge the huge progress that Albania has made and to see that Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made a certain amount of improvement."
"Unfortunately, there are politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are less concerned about the interests of their citizens, as they are secure in the knowledge that they themselves, of course, have visa-free travel."
"I therefore believe that we need to ensure that this is possible by next summer."
"I hope that Mr Barrot will help us in that."
"However, we must not forget Kosovo."
"It must not be the last remaining black mark."
"We are obliged to help Kosovo to meet the benchmarks."
"It cannot do it alone."
"Visa-free travel is a deeply humanitarian act."
"I am pleased that we were all in a position to make this happen."
"Thank you for this opportunity, Mr Barrot."
"(HU) Europe and the European Union started off as a peace project and are now going through the longest peacetime period in history."
"Therefore, we are aware of what a powerful instrument integration can be from this perspective."
"Now we have to use it to deal with the Western Balkans."
"The Western Balkans have only recently gone through an extremely traumatic period of war, causing great suffering to a huge number of people."
"Progress needs to be made with the process of European integration in order to overcome this event."
"Visa-free travel is an important step in this."
"Several people have mentioned the opportunity it would provide young people with to establish direct contact and gain first-hand experience, as well as the opportunity for democratic forces to grow in strength."
"It is not only about providing a message of trust and visa-free travel."
"Europe can also benefit from the Western Balkans moving closer to the European Union from a security and economic policy perspective."
"However, it is important that we do not create new divisions in the region, but ensure that every country can participate in the visa-free travel scheme as soon as possible."
"(NL) Tomorrow, the European Parliament will be voting on the abolition of the short-stay visa requirement for Balkan countries."
"Not all the countries for whom a road map was drawn up are eligible to receive the waiver on 1 January."
"It is very unfortunate that, in one country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission proposal permits a disparity between different sections of the population: those able to benefit from visa-free travel to Europe on Croatian or Serbian passports and those - the Bosnian Muslims - who are not in possession of such a passport."
"This is an embarrassing distinction in view of the country's recent history."
"It is up to the European Parliament to send a signal to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania tomorrow."
"Criteria are criteria, and these requirements need to be met in order to qualify for the visa waiver."
"As soon as the benchmarks have been met, however, the visa waiver must be granted as soon as possible."
"We have seen that a great deal has been done to meet the benchmarks, and we call on the Commission to help Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to meet all the requirements as soon as possible."
"(SL) For the citizens of the Western Balkans, the abolition of the visa requirement for travel to the European Union does not only have a technical dimension, but an exceptional political charge and significance as well."
"Today, we rightly commemorated in Parliament the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and of full-blown socialism."
"However, Skopje, Podgorica and Belgrade will, during this Christmas and New Year, finally get to celebrate the fall of a visa wall which has separated them from us in the European Union for almost 12 years."
"For nearly 20 years, the majority of the population of the former Yugoslavia has been denied the opportunity of travelling freely across Europe, which is something they were used to previously, when they were still citizens of the now collapsed socialist federation."
"We are beginning to see the ugly consequences of such isolation, which has lasted an entire generation, and it is high time that we put an end to it."
"However, the Macedonians, the Montenegrins and the Serbs should be joined by the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, the Albanians and the Kosovars as early as possible in 2010."
"That alone will enable the new generations of those countries to finally see and experience the outside world, establish contacts with other Europeans, contribute to the development of European values at home and equip their nations for fully-fledged membership in our common European story - the European Union."
"As Parliament rapporteur for Macedonia, I have received a large number of phone calls in recent days from citizens of various Balkan countries."
"I wish to reassure them, loud and clear, that their visa-free travel to the EU is not a substitute for their accession to the EU."
"What their free travel in the EU amounts to is a step towards fully-fledged membership of the EU."
"(HU) I would like to welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"I also want to say that as far as I can see, on this 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, guaranteeing the crossing of borders in the case of Western Balkan countries becomes part of the series of events that started 20 years ago, like a new wall collapsing."
"This is why this proposal should be welcomed."
"However, we must not forget that the issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one, while it is a very clear political matter at the same time."
"This is why it is important."
"I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility."
"This responsibility also means action at the same time."
"First of all, it means action by the relevant states which have been unable to meet the visa-free travel conditions to fulfil these requirements as soon as possible, not to mention action from the European Commission without whose help this process would drag on."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that we are on the right track with regard to the Balkan States."
"We have drawn closer through visa facilitation and that will help to create stability, although it is also a sign of our appreciation of the efforts that have been made."
"However, I also think that it is good for us to retain a clear set of rules and for the requirements relating to these also to be complied with."
"In this regard, I would particularly like to thank Mrs Corazza Bildt for the efforts she has made."
"Anything else would, in my opinion, be a pure Brussels-based decision, in which a clear system would be abandoned and no honesty would be shown to the people affected in the Balkan States, just as little as is shown to our own people."
"Political signals should not be placed in a footnote or in an annex to a European directive or regulation; they need to be formulated properly."
"(PL) Madam President, I am glad that the citizens of Western Balkan countries will be able to move freely around the European Union."
"This will facilitate interpersonal contact, extend business possibilities and create conditions for the residents of the region to get to know the European Union better."
"We cannot, however, allow our Eastern neighbours to be isolated."
"We cannot deny them the opportunity which we are giving to other European countries."
"We must establish for them, too, clear criteria and an action plan for greater liberalisation of visa traffic."
"We have to bear in mind that the cost of a visa is a considerable expense for the residents of these countries, and the application procedures take a long time, which restricts the possibilities for developing a whole range of forms of cooperation."
"We should also remember that in 2012, the European football championships will be held in Poland and Ukraine, so the possibility of free movement will be especially important."
"(RO) I, too, wish to stress the importance of freedom of movement as a fundamental right, and I reconfirm that numerous citizens from countries in the Western Balkans will enjoy this right."
"I obviously welcome this openness."
"However, at the same time, I wish to deplore the fact that this report ultimately did not feature any reference at all to a country included in the Eastern Partnership."
"I believe that it needed to be associated with Moldova, if only symbolically."
"We are talking about Moldova, a country which has made considerable progress on the political front."
"I think that the most solid wall we know in Europe is on the eastern border, between Romania and Moldova."
"I believe we must deplore this fact."
"Madam President, my thanks to all of the speakers who have largely supported the process of abolishing visas for three leading Balkan States."
"You made it clear that freedom of movement was obviously very desirable."
"As Mr Moraes said, it is beneficial for both parties - for Europe and for the Balkan States."
"At the same time as thanking all of the speakers and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, I would simply like to say, Madam President, that, ever since part of the decisions were pretty much taken for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, we have offered continual assistance to Albania, which I have visited personally, and to Bosnia and Herzegovina, precisely so as to help them make progress - and we shall continue to do so."
"I believe that the very swift adoption of this resolution is a good indicator of the way in which we will be able to move on quickly to the other states and, in particular, to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Albania, without forgetting, of course, Kosovo."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, once again I thank all those who made contributions, which prove that the European Union strongly supports visa liberalisation for all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"I regret that the Swedish Minister was not here, because we had very good cooperation."
"I welcome the Commission's commitment to do everything possible to accelerate the process for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania, and I hope both countries will introduce visa-free regimes once they meet the criteria - as soon as possible, possibly in summer next year."
"I want to say that I involved everyone in this, and I am fully aware of what the treaties prescribe."
"But this is a political House, and we all do serious politics as best we can."
"Once again, I welcome the abolition of visas for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro on 19 December, and I really hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania can follow as soon as possible."
"We are talking about the destiny of the young generation."
"It is our political responsibility to finish this visa liberalisation process, and we also have to find a solution for all the people in Kosovo."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for drafting an acceptable compromise on this matter."
"The issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one."
"It is also a very definite political matter."
"Visa-free travel is based on mutual trust and commitments."
"This is why I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration, in addition to the report, because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility."
"Responsibility, of course, also means action."
"First of all, it means action by the relevant states which have been unable to meet the visa-free travel conditions."
"They must do their utmost so that these conditions are met as soon as possible."
"It also means action by the European Commission without whose effective help this process would only drag on, which cannot be in our interest."
"It also concerns Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania and Kosovo."
"As a Hungarian MEP, I would like once again to mention that, thanks to visa-free travel status for Serbia, a more direct link is being established between Hungarians living in Vojvodina in Serbia and the mother country, not to mention with Europe too."
"Citizens who live on either side of these borders, speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties are unable, for their part, to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa."
"Today we are marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and cutting through the barbed wire."
"Guaranteeing the crossing of borders in the case of Western Balkan countries becomes part of the series of events that started 20 years ago, like a new wall collapsing"
"Medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments and social conditionality (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission, by Tatjana Ždanoka and Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the S&D Group, and Marian Harkin and Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments and social conditionality - B7-0215/2009)."
"author. - Mr President, I come from Latvia, a country hit severely by the financial crisis."
"Latvia was at risk of going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside."
"We received such assistance from the EU and the IMF."
"However, as a precondition, the Latvian Government had to cut budgetary spending."
"It did so by reducing pensions by 10% and the pensions of working pensioners by 70%, reducing family benefits and maternity benefits for working parents by 10%, as well as reducing non-taxable personal income tax thresholds."
"The approach, as you see, was an egalitarian one."
"Whether one's pension was EUR 100 or EUR 1 000, 10% was taken off."
"The Commission welcomed these cuts which were made in such a scandalous manner, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Latvia."
"It was clear from the very beginning that such unselective cuts would hit the most vulnerable in society."
"Is the Commission not aware of the European Year against Poverty?"
"The Latvian situation is not unique in the Union."
"Hungary and Romania have also received Community loans."
"Other countries may one day be forced to apply for such loans."
"We must therefore avoid creating a precedent of accepting antisocial measures."
"Commissioner, of course you can say that you only give the money, and that the governments of the Member States are responsible for social policy, but social rights are legally binding on the institutions of the European Union."
"This means that everything the institutions do must be measured against social rights."
"Otherwise, words about a high level of social protection as an EU task will do no more than raise an ironical smile."
"author. - Mr President, this is not about telling Member States exactly what they should or should not be spending their money on."
"Each country has its own immediate priorities for getting themselves out of their financial difficulties."
"But when Member States do receive that aid from the European Union under this provision, they should be encouraged to spend it in a way that respects the principles of the Union - in other words, not ignoring the need for social protection and social inclusion."
"This financial crisis has hit people across the European Union hard, and therefore it is right that this fund exists."
"Millions of people have lost their jobs."
"Many of those who have become unemployed in those Member States are the most vulnerable and the least likely to find employment quickly."
"That is why it is important that social safety nets in those Member States are not ignored."
"We have asked in our oral question particularly about whether Member States are required to include an evaluation of the social impact in their reports that they submit to the Commission."
"I would be pleased if you can inform us about whether that is the case."
"It is important that we give the right message to Member States that are receiving European funding through the medium-term financial assistance."
"I believe personally that we must make it clear that the Commission might take into account the way the most vulnerable have been helped, before agreeing any further assistance."
"I know that when Member States are in financial difficulties, it is quite often not easy to continue to be aware of their social obligations, hence this oral question."
"It is so important to remember that this financial crisis has a human face as well and that face is represented quite often by the already most marginalised in society."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, before asking the question, I carefully read the previous questions and the positions that Parliament had taken on those questions."
"It is a fact, not an opinion, that on 24 April this year, Parliament adopted a legislative resolution with the aim of amending Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 which, under Article 100 of the treaty, governs those financial instruments."
"Commissioner, in that resolution, Parliament supported this assistance to tackle the specific public finance problems of those Member States most affected by the financial crisis, it expressed its full solidarity, above all with the states that have most recently joined the EU but, at the same time, Commissioner, Parliament clearly said that this assistance ought to be conditional and set out four criteria, which are the Community objectives."
"These are: firstly, that there should be quality in public expenditure, that money should not be wasted; secondly, that social security systems and sustainable growth should be adhered to; thirdly, that the policy of full employment of a decent quality should not be abandoned; and, fourthly, that climate change should be combated."
"Logically speaking, if these are good objectives for us, they should also be complied with in those countries."
"A few months have passed and we have received quite a few reports from NGOs, trade unions and citizens about one of the four countries that have received very significant amounts of assistance to public finances: EUR 6.5 billion, 3.1 billion, 2.2 billion and 5 billion."
"They are giving us figures such as those which my fellow Member just quoted: cuts of 40% in the education sector; cuts of 10% in the pensions programme; a halving of subsidies for the ill, etc."
"Commissioner, in the face of this situation, Parliament wishes, at least, for our silence not to be interpreted there - as it is being interpreted - as if we are the ones imposing these measures; at least, we ought not to be complicit in this interpretation, which sees Europe as attacking these most needy sections of the population."
"Commissioner, if possible, we ought to avoid a situation where it is the weakest who pay for the adjustment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problems in Latvia, Hungary and Romania, which are the three European Union countries that are currently receiving loans through the balance of payments facility, are problems that have not been created by this Parliament, or the European Commission, or the European Union."
"They are problems created by the economic crisis, but they have been aggravated by mismanagement and misguided policies undertaken by the political leaders of those countries."
"I say this because there are countries in the same region of the European Union as Latvia, in the same region of the European Union as Hungary, and in the same region of the European Union as Romania, which are not having the same problems, and which are doing a better job of tackling the crisis, with support from European budgets, through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with the protection given by membership of the European Union and prospective membership of the euro, but without the need to ask for assistance from the balance of payments facility."
"Why have these three countries had to ask for assistance?"
"Why have we had to lend them money?"
"It is not through the fault of the Commission or Parliament, or the European Union in general: it is because of mismanagement in those countries."
"How are we helping them?"
"We are doing so by lending them money; and nobody makes loans without conditions; we do not have the authorisation of this Parliament or of the Council to make loans without conditions."
"We are lending upon certain conditions, and we are imposing on those countries some conditions which are tough, because their situations are extraordinarily difficult, but we are saying to them: 'do not make cuts in order to be able to cofinance the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund; do not adopt retrogressive measures; do not make cuts that damage the weakest'."
"Sometimes we are successful and sometimes, unfortunately, we are unsuccessful, because the matter is not in our hands, but in theirs."
"Therefore, I share your concerns, and not only do I share them, but also, on behalf of all of you, I am passing them on to those governments at the same time as giving them money in the name of the European Union: EUR 3.1 billion of lending to Latvia, and very large amounts also to Romania and Hungary."
"Please note this, however: nobody makes loans without conditions, and I am not authorised to do so on behalf of you, on behalf of the Member States."
"We cannot, for better or for worse, take decisions which are the responsibility of the governments and parliaments of those countries."
"What we do do is to remind the governments and parliaments of those countries, firstly, of their responsibility for extricating their countries from a crisis which other countries are not suffering to such a serious extent; and secondly, that there are measures that cannot be taken, and we are not prepared to lend money so that measures are adopted that go beyond what is strictly necessary to adjust public finances and place those countries in a position to tackle their futures without the need to ask the European Union for loans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the commissioner's comments just now genuinely answer the question that was asked."
"The European Union does not make funds available without conditions."
"Those conditions have been mentioned: quality of public spending, sustainable development objectives, employment policy, climate change, but also, of course, the need to make up for the shortfalls of the previous administration as quickly as possible, so that these countries that we are helping can reach the level required."
"However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions."
"We must trust the governments of the Member States that receive European aid to implement the necessary provisions and avoid, as the commissioner said, provisions that could be retrograde or backward-looking."
"Social spending is, of course, important - it must be preserved - but here, too, we must trust the Member States to adopt the measures needed to rectify the situation and not carry out nit-picking checks, which would be ineffective anyway."
"The time to assess the way in which the Member States have used European aid will be when any new aid is granted, and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable, particularly in the social sphere."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you will very clearly recall that when, on 24 April - as my colleague, Mr Cercas, pointed out - we endorsed, validated and ratified the increase in the balance of payments facility, we did so on two conditions: firstly, that this aid come with conditions attached, particularly in the case of social aid; and, secondly, that there be transparency, so that this House would be clear about the conditions under which such agreements were concluded with the Member States in question."
"I therefore believe that the debate that we are holding this evening is a just, useful and democratic debate and one which must provide evidence of effective action."
"We are in an absolutely critical situation where the European Union is concerned and we can clearly see that this crisis is damaging the very foundations of solidarity among Member States and particularly solidarity towards certain Member States."
"The situation is only made worse by the news reaching us from Romania, where we are in a very difficult position as a result of the political uncertainty caused by the consequences of this crisis in particular."
"However, I would not want us to repeat the mistakes of the past, especially those that we were able to attribute to the IMF which, 10 or so years ago, was applying formulas that were ultimately making things worse."
"Furthermore, I strongly disagree with my fellow Member, Mr Gauzès, when he recommends not carrying out nit-picking checks but waiting for the next request to examine the quality of aid spending."
"No!"
"It is when the aid is committed that one can define the conditions, and I feel that Europe has paid enough of a price for not examining the conditionality of aid in many areas to close its eyes in this case."
"We cannot accept today, within the European Union, the most vulnerable having to pay for the adjustment policies."
"I do not believe that it is a case of accusing the Commission of mismanaging Latvian policy."
"No one in this House indicated to you, Commissioner, that that was the path that we wanted to follow."
"However, we cannot allow the most vulnerable to pay the price for the European Union's budget commitment and for our solidarity towards Latvia, because we do not believe that this is the way to restore solidarity and the balance of the Latvian economy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the EU's social protection and social inclusion process is core to ensuring the achievement of the European Union's strategic goal of sustained economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"During an economic crisis, there are increased risks of poverty and social exclusion for many citizens, but particularly for those on the margins of society, for those who become unemployed and for those who rely on the various social safety nets that operate within the different Member States."
"This question asks the Commission if it is attempting to mainstream the social protection and inclusion process in the provision of medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments under Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002."
"I am always sensitive to the imposition of too many conditions and excessive red tape on recipients of assistance, and that goes for Member States right down to SMEs and individuals."
"However, when that imposition would help to realise a core EU principle such as social inclusion, then it is indeed important."
"We cannot aspire to a social inclusion process and produce lots and lots of documents outlining how to achieve it if, at the same time, we do not ensure that this process is mainstreamed in our initiatives."
"The Commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans, but I was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and, indeed, if they include social conditionality."
"Regardless of the circumstances whereby EU funds are disbursed, we cannot wash our hands and hope for the best."
"We have been asked to trust Member States."
"Trusting Member States is fine, but trust has always to be earned and if there are concerns, I believe they need to be dealt with."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, most economists now say that the crisis is largely due to the transfer of wealth created by labour into capital, into profits."
"Moreover, in general, it is also agreed that it is in the countries that have maintained their social welfare systems and their public services that the populations have suffered relatively less as a result of the crisis."
"However, the problem facing us this evening is indeed the nature of the conditions that you attach to the granting of European assistance or International Monetary Fund assistance to the populations."
"This assistance can no longer be conditional on the application of structural adjustment plans reducing social expenditure, training expenditure, and privatising public sectors, including social services of general interest."
"It is this that has become ineffective today, and it needs to be recognised."
"All of this will only make the crisis, unemployment and poverty worse."
"This is why, in our view, we have to reverse the criteria of this conditionality and decide that European public funds or IMF funds can be conditioned, can be combined with a new system of appropriations and will be granted in accordance with new criteria aimed at and encouraging a new distribution of wealth so as to increase pay, pensions and minimum social requirements and to maintain a high level of social protection, the guarantee of a job for all."
"Ultimately, it is social progress that goes hand in hand with economic efficiency, not the other way round."
"(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission has shown clear and cooperative understanding to those Member States that have encountered fiscal difficulties because of the crisis."
"Stable, strong social support systems cannot be maintained if the Member States do not have strong economies."
"My fellow Members are proposing to restrict the conditions for offering financial support, but I consider this to be undesirable in principle."
"Instead, we should give serious consideration to the possibility of extending the conditions under which financial support may be obtained, allowing it to be used not only to reinforce states' budgets and financial systems, but also for the development of the economy."
"Investment in the economy is necessary in order to guarantee a stable social support system in the long term."
"The use of financial aid resources in this way too would be the best way in which to provide help as quickly as possible to Member States encountering financial difficulties."
"The recovery of states from the crisis and their further stabilisation is closely linked with European Union policy in relation to those states."
"Only harmonised and effective action will produce results on an EU-wide scale."
"Financial aid is not, and cannot be, the only way in which European states can support each other."
"Complex solutions must be found that will foster the economic development of all the European Union Member States."
"(HU) The countries which we are talking about in this case are the European Union's new Member States which have had, following the changes of regime, to look after those who lost out from the change of regime, become more competitive after economic restructuring in an open market, as well as create and build economies with balanced structures."
"People have the smallest reserves then in these countries."
"It means that they are finding it difficult to repay home loans due to the high currency-based debt ratio."
"Unemployment is rising due to economic problems developing unilaterally and social expenditure is also decreasing."
"We can see instability, particularly political instability developing as a result of social tensions."
"More countries are seeing a rise in support for extremist views, and populism is gaining ground."
"I think that we must take all these factors into account when assessing the situation and devise what other measures we need to take in relation to European solidarity and which are based on it."
"(DE) Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament's agenda many times."
"It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund."
"That has been said a couple of times already."
"Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament."
"In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU."
"On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request."
"It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail."
"As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests."
"Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered?"
"If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered?"
"My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests?"
"(RO) As a representative of Romania, a country which has benefited from financial assistance for its balance of payments from the European Commission, I would like to thank the European Commission for the speedy action it took in granting financial assistance for the balance of payments, without which Romania's economic and social problems would have been much tougher."
"Those countries which have received financial assistance certainly have many social problems, and we can discuss what type of social conditionality could be included in these financial assistance agreements."
"If we present the problem in this manner, we must bear in mind that there are insurance and social assistance systems in these countries which have contributed to the imbalances that required the financial assistance for the balance of payments."
"This is why if we are discussing social conditionality, we must also discuss the reforms which need to be made to these social sectors, primarily the pensions scheme, so that we can achieve medium and long-term financial sustainability, which will help radically resolve the problems in these countries."
"Mr President, the ILO said recently - in June when it launched its global pact for jobs - that the world should look different after the crisis."
"I fear that is not what is happening."
"What we should have at the end of this crisis is a more sustainable economy with decent work, with quality public services and fair globalisation, moving towards the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals."
"But that is not what we are getting."
"What we are getting is a retrenchment by the banks and by the financiers in Europe and around the world who are simply trying to retain their privileges."
"At the same time that the Commission is sanctioning the pumping of billions of euros into the saving of the Irish banks, we have an Irish Government which is planning this very minute to destroy local development, to destroy community development programmes which are supported by the European Union."
"They are setting out to destroy our education system."
"Today we had the launch by the European Foundation for Living and Working conditions of the report entitled Restructuring in the Recession."
"If I could just quote two lines here: 'Ideally it would be preferable to ensure that measures to address the immediate problems caused by the recession are aligned with long-term goals'."
"Surely the Commission should be insisting that all Member States should at least seek to do that."
