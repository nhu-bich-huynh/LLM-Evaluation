"Text"
"Let us be careful, however, not to repeat the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy which, by setting unrealistic goals, has been more disappointing than anything else."
"Let us be careful to ensure that the new economic strategy, dubbed 'European Union 2020', does not become yet another complicated beast."
"Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, on climate change, too, Europe is showing a sense of responsibility."
"With its decision to release EUR 2.4 billion in aid each year for three years, Europe is setting an example by providing a third of the international aid earmarked for the poorest countries."
"I now expect our partners to do the same."
"From Copenhagen I expect balanced commitments, short- and medium-term commitments, and verifiable commitments, together with financial penalties in the event of non-compliance."
"In other words, I expect Copenhagen not to mislead Europe."
"To conclude, the PPE Group supports the Council's guidelines on security under the new Stockholm Programme."
"Our fellow citizens want more security, but also respect for public freedoms."
"They want to be protected in their daily lives, they want to know what they are eating and what they are consuming but, at the same time, they expect - and this is only natural - to live in a fairer society that is more respectful of others."
"This is precisely the kind of Europe that we, the PPE Group, defend and promote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, now that the acute crises and the institutional ups and downs are over, the time has come to take big decisions, and our margin for error is small."
"In a few days' time, we will see whether Europe's courageous stand on climate change has paid off."
"We will see whether the United States, China and the others are simply playing for time or whether they want to qualify for the final to become the world's responsible stakeholders."
"I wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for its efforts and, above all, now that Christmas is here, Mr Reinfeldt."
"You have worked hard over the last six months; it was not easy, as we all know."
"I also wish the best of luck to Mr Van Rompuy, who will take over for two and a half years, and I ask the Council not to forget that, from now on, the Council and Parliament are playing in the same league under somewhat more transparent circumstances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of transition has been mentioned several times today and I believe that it an appropriate term to describe the Swedish Presidency."
"It was a presidency of transition from one treaty, the Treaty of Nice, which had proved to be totally impracticable, to the Treaty of Lisbon, which is overloaded with expectations, not all of which, in my opinion, can be met, as the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be the end of institutional development in Europe."
"In this regard, we must be careful not to expect the Treaty of Lisbon to fulfil all of our wishes for all solutions to all of the problems of the world, because we can see how difficult it is to work with the Treaty of Lisbon by all the points of order that have been raised."
"I would like to begin with the institutional problems that this treaty has created."
"We still have the Swedish Prime Minister here today."
"Who will represent the Council Presidency next time?"
"Mr Van Rompuy, the rotating Council Presidency, then the President of the Commission, then Baroness Ashton - if they all speak then at least, for the first time, for the first four speeches we will not have this permanent PPE conference, and we will then have Baroness Ashton and hence a proper socialist, who will stir things up."
"That is definitely one benefit."
"(Heckling)"
"Of course, I do not know whether it will be Mr Van Rompuy or Mr Zapatero who will attend, but thank you, Mr Langen."
"If you already know that it is Mr Zapatero who will attend, you have made a useful contribution for once."
"Thank you very much."
"The Swedish Presidency was a presidency of transition, but also a presidency that once again had to experience Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy playing their cards very close to their chests to the very end, letting the current Presidency run its course - while the public said 'it does not know what is going on, it cannot do anything' - and has to pay the price for their tactical game."
"That has been the fate of Mr Reinfeldt over the last few months."
"Thank goodness, that has now come to an end."
"That is the progress we have made with the Treaty of Lisbon: a bit more transparency in our institutional structures."
"And surely something else, too: the enhancement of the power of the European Parliament."
"However, more power for the European Parliament also means that the other institutions will have to deal with Parliament."
"For the President of the European Council, this means that he will have to coordinate decisions that he wishes to prepare in the Council - legislative decisions at least - with Parliament."
"He would be wise not to view the President of the European Parliament as a spectator at the Council meetings, but as the representative of an institution that has been given greater power."
"That is what I expect from Mr Van Rompuy, for example."
"The Council, and the Commission, too, would be well advised to try to seek a majority in Parliament, on the basis of this new treaty, that will also be able to meet the social, environmental and finance policy challenges that they themselves formulate in their programmes because, for legislation, they ultimately need a qualified majority in this Parliament if they want to push through their initiatives."
"Therefore, the Commission would be well advised to seek a majority throughout the whole breadth of Parliament, which is perhaps something that does not go well with the fact that Members of the Commission are deputy leaders of European parties and are therefore evidence of the one-sidedness of certain political trends."
"That is something, Mr Barroso, that you need to think very seriously about."
"The Swedish Presidency has put in a lot of effort."
"I will gladly admit that here."
"However, ultimately - and this is not your fault, Mr Reinfeldt, but the fault of the system - it has had no influence on the big decisions, including those that are currently being made in Copenhagen, because a single rotating presidency cannot influence very much at all, it can only coordinate, and there is a difference between coordinating and influencing."
"Influencing the supervision of the financial markets, climate change, the efforts for economic recovery - these are things that only Europe as a whole can do, with its institutions in collaboration."
"I therefore believe that the Treaty of Lisbon represents progress."
"The fact that the Swedish Presidency ultimately put it in place seems to me to have been the big success of this transition Presidency."
"Mr President, firstly, I will not be talking this morning about institutional matters, as others before me have done."
"We will certainly have time to discuss these matters, since the Council is apparently going to implement a protocol that requires an intergovernmental conference."
"We must think about whether or not we want a conference."
"I believe that we in the European Parliament will nonetheless have a few ideas on this subject to ensure that we make progress with European democracy and that we compensate for the lack of transparency and democracy in the cooptations being proposed."
"That being said, I should especially like to thank the Presidency, Prime Minister Reinfeldt and Mrs Malmström for the excellent relations they have maintained with Parliament and for their fine management of what were, after all, very difficult issues - I am, of course, talking about the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We even had to overcome the 'Klaus obstacle'; from now on, we will talk about the Klaus obstacle and the excellent way in which the Swedish Presidency solved that problem."
"Secondly, I believe that the other most important element is the Stockholm Programme, which has been adopted and which now needs to be implemented."
"However, for you, Mr Reinfeldt, the Presidency does not end here of course, since there is still the Copenhagen Summit, where you must gain some ground."
"I would like to send out, today, before this House, an optimistic and purposeful message, which somewhat contradicts what we read in today's press."
"Today's press is characterised by pessimism: will an agreement be reached or not?"
"I believe that an agreement is possible because serious partners are out there, and we must try to find and motivate them."
"The fact that President Obama and the Chinese Prime Minister are arriving tomorrow and the day after tomorrow testifies to their will to reach an agreement."
"I believe that we must follow a strategy."
"Which one, though, ladies and gentlemen?"
"I believe that we must follow a strategy whereby we try to establish three-way cooperation between the United States, China and Europe."
"If, in the next two days, these three reach an initial agreement, then we will have a serious basis on which to convince the others - India, Brazil and the other countries - to join in this effort."
"I therefore call for a proactive approach."
"The most important thing is to strive for this three-way alliance, which is necessary in order to reach an agreement, and to propose, from the outset, a 30% reduction in emissions."
"A sense of purpose must be shown in this proposal."
"In my view, we must let ourselves be guided, in this final phase of the negotiations, in Copenhagen, by Hegel, who said that it is not the impossible that drives one to despair, but what was possible but was not achieved."
"I believe that, with the Swedish Presidency's persistence, we will achieve success at the Copenhagen Summit."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, after having spent four days in Copenhagen, I find it extremely difficult to listen to the words 'leading role of the European Union'."
"Leadership - and I learnt this back in nursery school - is primarily achieved by setting a good example."
"I would now like to ask you, Mr Reinfeldt and Mr Barroso, whether you actually believe that, with a strategy based on lies, self-deception and large-scale international deception, we can achieve a leading role in an international process such as that in Copenhagen."
"You should know, Mr Reinfeldt - and Mr Barroso certainly knows this because he has been involved long enough - that the two-degree goal is a 'mission impossible' if the Europeans stick with the offers that they have so far brought to the table. The reduction target is inadequate."
"At the same time, we Europeans have opened all the back doors in order to avoid a reduction policy at home."
"There are no limits to off-setting any more."
"Hot air has become the order of the day not only for Poland, but for Sweden, too."
"The inclusion of forests, which you and your government in particular have been promoting, Mr Reinfeldt, is another contribution from Europe to avoiding having an active reduction policy."
"It has been assessed by many experts in Copenhagen that what you, yourselves, have so far proposed as being the best we can do would not result in emissions in Europe falling by 2020, but rising."
"So, Mr Reinfeldt, please explain how we are to achieve the two-degree target if you stick to what has so far been offered."
"To make matters worse, a German newspaper, the Financial Times, announced today that you have given up on the 30% target for 2020 and now want to offer this for 2025 instead."
"If you really want to promote this process, I would ask you, as a matter of urgency, to take back what has been published in the newspaper today as the European line."
"I will say one last thing to finish."
"There will be thousands of official observers standing outside the doors of the Bella Centre over the next few days - even though they have accreditation for the conference."
"These are people who have been working extremely hard for climate policy for years, some of them for decades."
"Please ensure that, because these people are suddenly no longer able to be involved, they do not end up in cages or having to sit for hours with their hands bound on the frozen ground."
"There are a lot of leading roles to lose in Copenhagen."
"However, the way in which the rule of law in the EU is presented there - I do not care for disruptive crowds, not one bit - and the disproportionate treatment of the peaceful demonstrators - Cecilia Malmström is, of course, an expert in law - is also something that you really ought to explain in Copenhagen."
"Mr President, it is a pity you only spoke about keeping to time just before my speech."
"I will try to observe the time limit."
"Mr Reinfeldt, you do, of course, deserve our thanks."
"As has been said, the Swedish Presidency came at a difficult period of transition and turbulence associated with adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That is behind us now, but the presidency also came at a time of economic crisis."
"I would like to begin my speech, which is not going to be all complimentary, by thanking you that the Swedish Presidency avoided the temptation of populism, so easy to fall into, in these difficult times of crisis."
"Mr Reinfeldt, you have proved there are no easy answers to difficult questions."
"The Swedish Presidency has shown that in times of crisis, the European Union is able to look for good and non-populist solutions which can help not only Europe, but the whole world, to get out of this difficult situation."
"I would like to thank you very sincerely for doing that difficult work, for your respect for the Member States, and also for the respect you have shown for the European Parliament."
"It was a difficult time, and I think you have passed the exam here."
"You will be able to end your mission in two weeks' time with complete satisfaction."
"I think it was not without reason that in your speech, you did not mention foreign policy."
"Unfortunately, I am forced, here, to say some severe words."
"I think that in the field of foreign policy, particularly in two areas, the Swedish Presidency and the last six months cannot be accounted successful."
"Firstly, what I think was a completely unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article about Israeli soldiers in a Swedish newspaper, and the whole unnecessary aggravation of relations between the Swedish Presidency and Israel cast a shadow over the last six months."
"I want to say it was wrong that the presidency did not unequivocally condemn the article in the Swedish paper."
"I and my entire group think Israeli soldiers are not only defending Israel, but the whole of our civilisation."
"I think the last six months have been lacking in unequivocal support for our main ally in the Middle East, Israel."
"Evidence of this is the outcome of the last European Council concerning the Middle East, which, although it is, in my opinion, better than what was proposed, does not give us a leading role in the Middle East."
"The European Union should be leading the peace process, and should be the main force striving for peace in the Middle East."
"If we want to play this role, we must overcome our own differences."
"We cannot adopt unilateral pro-Palestinian positions."
"The last six months of foreign policy have, unfortunately, not put a stop to this."
"We spoke about this yesterday during the debate on Georgia."
"I think that rising Russian imperialism is one of the European Union's most serious problems."
"It is dangerous not only for Russia's neighbours, but for the entire European Union."
"Nevertheless, I would like to thank you, Mr Reinfeldt, for your leadership and for the Swedish leadership of the European Union."
"The role of Parliament is to draw attention to that which is not always, in our opinion, the best."
"I think that, on balance, in spite of the negative comments I have made, the Swedish Presidency has been a positive one."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) I would like to ask Mr Kamiński whether he considers the actions carried out by Israeli soldiers in Gaza as part of the fight for human civilisation."
"It is you who is biased, because anyone who wants peace in this region should primarily stand up, in accordance with the UN resolutions, for the Palestinians' right to an independent state."
"You are the one unfairly calling Sweden to account for a stance which it adopted."
"I think Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East."
"The state of Israel is a shining example to the countries of the Middle East in the area of democracy."
"War is, of course, a difficult thing, which always brings painful consequences."
"This is why we are for peace."
"In my opinion, our role is to support the peace process in the Middle East and to oppose terrorism resolutely."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency."
"I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU."
"On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy."
"However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it?"
"I have not seen it."
"With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate."
"Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too."
"Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people."
"That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union's strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term."
"My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax."
"In yesterday's debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future."
"We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt."
"Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the financial crisis, it certainly cannot be argued that the Swedish Presidency has behaved logically and adopted a clear-sighted and clear-cut stance."
"Why did you lack the courage to give the names and surnames of those responsible for the financial crisis, clearly stating measures to clip the wings of speculation, or spell out to European citizens that our banks and our financial institutions are still peddling many of the financial products subject to speculation, and polluting our market?"
"Why did you not offer a clear gesture of support to the real economy, which is represented above all by the archipelago of small and medium-sized enterprises, by the world of production, by the healthy world of our European economy, to which, I repeat, it is and always will be necessary to offer signs of encouragement and of true support?"
"Perhaps the most significant challenge that the Swedish Presidency had to face concerned freedom, security and justice, and that also applies to implementation of the Stockholm Programme."
"What conclusion can be drawn from this?"
"I believe that this Presidency has not taken sufficient action against illegal immigration, and that the action it has taken has been extremely ineffective."
"The Presidency has not been active in opposing illegal immigration even with regard to integration projects and dealing with the problem of refugees."
"It appears that Europe has spoken out feebly, not merely in general about foreign policy - and I am fully in agreement with those who have objected to this - but also on this specific topic."
"Europe has apparently lacked authority on such a key subject as immigration, however you look at it; whether from the viewpoint of people like me who are very concerned about illegal immigration, or from the perspective of those who are more concerned with implementing integration policies."
"We have high hopes that the new Spanish Presidency will implement the ideas that have already been disclosed in some influential statements, which argue that Europe must not think of immigration as a problem exclusive to countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"This is evidently a problem that concerns all of Europe, but there is one point on which the government of my country expressed a clear request, which was nonetheless disregarded."
"It suggested adopting a serious Europe-wide strategy to fight the legacy of organised crime; a strategy that has yielded exceptional results in Italy."
"This legacy is present throughout Europe: the Mafia, the organised Mafias have invaded all of Europe, infiltrating the real economy and particularly the financial economy."
"We are still awaiting a clear signal that we will see the introduction of a European legal system against this type of organised crime, which is so very powerful in several countries - if not in all the countries of the European Union."
"Since this type of crime can operate too freely, it has taken advantage of our freedoms, moving as it pleases between financial marketplaces, tax havens and markets dealing in property and other assets."
"It is precisely on this point that we could have done with a much greater degree of clarity, a more clear-cut line of action by the Swedish Presidency."
"We accuse the Swedish Presidency openly."
"And then we come to the statements of certain representatives of this Presidency on another important and symbolic question, that of the Swiss referendum on minarets."
"The Swedish Foreign Ministry defined a 'no' to the building of minarets as the 'expression of a prejudice'."
"It went even further, claiming that Berne's very decision to hold a referendum on a matter like this was questionable."
"So here we have a question that lies outside the scope of the referendum, and that is the question of whether or not to hold a referendum."
"How can the European Union lawmakers bring themselves to reproach a small country that has always been democratic, ever since the Middle Ages?"
"Should it really be us, the slaves of a bureaucracy elected by nobody, teaching the Swiss people about democracy?"
"Should we be the ones to deny them the right to hold a referendum on an important question, on which everyone is entitled to their own opinion?"
"On the contrary, the European Union should learn from Swiss democracy how to tackle the most sensitive problems, by giving a voice to the people, the people, the people, not the bureaucracies, the lobbies and the banks of this European superpower, which always makes decisions about citizens' lives without consulting them!"
"(SV) Mr President, I am glad that the spineless, cowardly Swedish Presidency is over."
"(NL) Thankfully, this weak Swedish Presidency has come to an end, as not much good has come out of Sweden."
"There has been no tough line on Turkey, which continues to occupy Cyprus illegally."
"Sweden has left Israel in the lurch, and its proposal to divide Jerusalem illustrates its naivety about the objectionable, barbarous ideology that is Islam."
"Sweden would have done better to strongly support the holding of European referendums in all Member States, as Switzerland did on the minaret ban."
"That is what the European public wants."
"The travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg has not even made it onto the agenda, Mr Reinfeldt."
"We did ask you for this, but obviously you did not dare comply, no doubt scared off by France."
"Then you go squandering money on climate policy in Copenhagen even though climate change is not a scientific certainty."
"The Netherlands pays out a large amount of money."
"Its net contribution per capita is still two to three times that of other rich countries."
"This situation must be rectified as soon as possible."
"We hope that the next presidency will show more courage."
"Mr President, I have noticed that you have given almost one minute more speaking time to some of our colleagues."
"I would like to remind you that we from small countries, as newly elected Members, have only one strict minute for 'catch the eye', and this time has been taken away from our opportunity to express our views."
"Please respect us as well."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I have two brief remarks to make."
"Firstly I would like to thank Members for their kind words - also other words, but mainly kind words and kind comments."
"We now have a new European Union based on the Lisbon Treaty, and I could say, being involved in the rotating presidency, that, to make this Europe work for the future, it will be a combination of taking responsibility on the part of Member States, the Commission and this Parliament."
"It will be very difficult, without full responsibility taken by all these parties, to get this work on track."
"Just a few comments on trying to coordinate 27 Member States."
"That takes time, but, without doing that, we get a situation where this European Union is managed by just a few or by someone else."
"We have taken that time."
"I know how much time you need to make this coordination, and I think that will be obvious also for Herman Van Rompuy and also the still ongoing rotating presidency."
"My second comment concerns Copenhagen."
"I frequently hear this: Europe is not leading, and in my country the opposition says that Sweden is not leading: it is the will to bash on ourselves."
"Then show me who the leader is."
"I would like to know that, because it would be perfect to see that leader and to follow their initiatives."
"I have not seen that yet."
"We are committing ourselves to reductions, legally based, earlier on the table, with concrete financing that I have not seen from other parts of the developing world."
"Also, when it comes to Copenhagen, I think it is very important to remember that we need to keep the 2 °C target. I am not sure that we will be able to deliver that."
"I know that Europe has done its part and is ready to move to 30%, but we cannot solve the problem alone."
"We only stand for 13% of global emissions."
"If this is to be a global answer, it must be a global response, and then we also need the other major emitters to make bigger commitments."
"A few words on Sweden, since that was mentioned."
"I think it is very important, after making these kinds of commitments - whether it is Kyoto or now an agreement in Copenhagen - to go home and do your job."
"We updated just yesterday the reduction of emissions that has been done in Sweden since 1990."
"We are now down to -12%."
"We are following how this is internationally respected, the way it is presented."
"We could always say that that is the wrong way of dealing with it, but that is the global agreement the world has."
"Concerning that, we have presented these kinds of figures."
"Of course, it is troublesome that some other countries are going in the other direction, and they are getting criticised for that."
"So it is not just striking a deal: it is also about making the changes in your economy using emission trading and other means to get the change in place."
"That is also an area where you see a lot of European countries acting in a way that is lacking in other parts of the world."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, just two remarks: the first on Copenhagen, and the other on the successful Swedish Presidency."
"First of all, regarding Copenhagen, I am also very surprised when I see many European colleagues with a self-defeating rhetoric."
"In fact, if there is a field where we can be proud of the leadership role of the European Union, it is precisely on climate change."
"Show me one relevant player or a group of countries that have committed as far as we have been committing ourselves."
"As I said earlier, some others have announced their intentions through press statements."
"The European Union has announced its intentions through legislation which is already binding: legislation which originated from the European Commission, which received the support of the European Council and of this Parliament, and - unilaterally and unconditionally - the European Union has already put the reduction of greenhouse gases at 20% by 2020."
"No other player has done anything comparable so far."
"So let us ask others to do something similar to our effort."
"(Applause)"
"Is this enough to reach the 2 °C?"
"No, it is not enough."
"That is why we are telling others that we can negotiate with each other."
"Politicians and diplomats can negotiate, but we cannot negotiate with science; we cannot negotiate with physics."
"So let us have a global deal which allows us to reach an agreement compatible with what science tells us."
"That cannot be done only by Europe, because Europe is responsible for about 14% of global emissions, and the trend is to go down in relevant terms."
"So, even if Europe, tomorrow, stops completely its greenhouse gas emissions, it will not solve the problem."
"So we need Americans on board, we need Chinese on board, we need Indians on board."
"During these six months, together with Prime Minister Reinfeldt, we spoke with Obama; we spoke with Hu and Wen; we spoke with Singh; we spoke with Medvedev; we spoke with Lola."
"And I can say that, in all those meetings, we were the ones asking them to come with more important offers."
"This is what we are now doing at Copenhagen - not to forget - because sometimes people tend to forget - that it is not just a game between those players but also with developing countries: the poorest, most vulnerable, the African countries."
"We also spoke with Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and others."
"That is why the European Union was the first to put some money on the table."
"So let us be honest with each other."
"We can always have more ambition, and the European Union has been showing its ambition."
"But let us ask also for more ambition from others, because only with this ambition can we have a deal which is compatible with our ambition."
"It is a global problem and we need a global solution."
"Finally, let me say a word to Prime Minister Reinfeldt and the Swedish Presidency."
"This is the last time we will have a President of the European Council only for six months, so it was the end of many years of European Union work."
"I want to say - and I said it to President Reinfeldt during these six months - that he was the 11th President of the European Council with whom I have worked, so I really welcome the fact that now we are going to have a permanent President of the European Council."
"But I would like to say to Prime Minster Reinfeldt that he was the 11th in the order of working with the Commission, but certainly he deserves a place on the podium as one of the best presidencies we have had during this period for the European Union."
"Thank you for everything you and the Swedish Presidency have been doing during these six months."
"Mr President, transparency towards Parliament is very often highlighted now that the Lisbon Treaty is in place."
"Is there a new proposal of the European Council for Copenhagen with a 30% target - a greater offsetting than the 20% target - for 2025?"
"There is a leaked document circulating in Copenhagen and I want clarification now, based on contacts with the Commission, whether this is the true strategy of the Council."
"Please tell us the truth."
"Mr President, I hesitate to phrase it in this way because it does not sound very modest as a Swede, but I think it is fair to say that the European Union and Europe will not be the same after this Presidency."
"It is a different European Union - a stronger and a better Union - for a number of reasons, some of which I as a Swede am very proud to mention."
"First of all, of course, the treaty that is now in place is changing the institutional balance of this Union, but it is also making it more capable of achieving our political goals."
"I would like to point to the fact that we have opened up the process of enlargement by the agreement between Slovenia and Croatia, which is important for Croatia, but also in the perspective of the Western Balkans and their ongoing future process of enlargement."
"This is one of the strengths of the European Union, but it is also an opportunity for all of us."
"I think it is also important to point to the fact that, during this Presidency and while we are standing here, the European Union is, for the first time, a leading global actor in one of the most important international issues mankind is facing."
"This is new and it gives great responsibilities for the future because it is obvious that, whatever is achieved in Copenhagen, the European Union has been playing a fundamental and crucial role in setting the agenda for the things that we should achieve."
"However successful we are, the job will not be finished, but it underlines the great responsibilities of the European Union."
"Then we have the economic recovery, with strict rules for getting public finances in order and for hindering protectionism."
"I am a Swede, so I may be a little subjective on this issue, but I think we all have a reason to be proud of what we have achieved during this period."
"But we should, in all modesty, also remember that those achievements give us a great responsibility for the future."
"(SV) Mr President, I want to start by saying that the Presidency has lived up to the high expectations placed on it as an efficient, diplomatic machine."
"That is much appreciated, particularly in view of the chaos that sometimes prevailed during the Czech Presidency."
"The concluding rounds relating to the Treaty of Lisbon were also dealt with in a very positive way."
"Finally, the Presidency also succeeded in introducing the permanent President of the European Council and the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"Unfortunately, its direct political impact on people's everyday lives has been somewhat less substantial."
"Europe's wage-earners have been given no support with bringing about an end to wage dumping in the wake of the Laval ruling, neither have they seen any new initiatives to deal with unemployment and create more jobs."
"The environmental movement is disappointed with Sweden for not standing up for environmental issues."
"In fact, Sweden has taken a step backwards rather than taking the opportunity to push for more challenging objectives in the area of the environment and climate change."
"The fact that Sweden does not have a more significant role at the climate conference currently taking place in Copenhagen, however, is more likely to be due to Prime Minister Reinfeldt himself, for party political reasons, having played down expectations of the conference at an early stage."
"This was contrary to the EU's negotiating strategy and exasperated a significant number of other European leaders."
"More serious than this, however, is the fact that it undermined the opportunity to bring about a good agreement on climate change."
"Finally, I would like to mention the Stockholm Programme - one of the few things that will live on after the Swedish Presidency is over."
"As a native of Stockholm myself, I am concerned that my home town may come to be associated with a political programme based more on a fortress Europe than on safeguarding human rights."
"We Swedish Social Democrats are nonetheless pleased that, in the end, you did listen in part to the demands from us and from Parliament to include more about the rights of women and children in this programme."
"We have great expectations that Mrs Malmström will do her utmost to reinforce these elements further in her new role."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, your calm and steady Presidency was a success."
"You had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job."
"The people chosen by you for the important new EU posts can now define these without any preconceived ideas, as they are as yet largely unknown to most European citizens."
"As an aside, if I may say so, your best decision is sitting on your right."
"Nevertheless, Mr Reinfeldt, I cannot give your Presidency full marks."
"There are two reasons for this."
"Firstly, you increased the development towards making the European Council into a kind of EU 'supergovernment'."
"Its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing, from the environment to financial policy."
"At the same time, you are closing the doors ever tighter."
"This is not what transparent debates by representatives of the people look like."
"The second reason is this: the fact that you pushed SWIFT through the Council just hours before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon demonstrates a clear disregard for the European Parliament and hence a lack of respect for the citizens."
"Nevertheless, I would like to thank you for the last six months."
"(SV) Mr President, the Swedish Presidency has functioned well in practical and institutional terms."
"It has been like a well-oiled, efficient machine - and yet it never got into gear."
"What happened to the social legislation?"
"Work on anti-discrimination has come to a standstill."
"The proposal to introduce a Eurovignette to stop emissions from heavy goods vehicles has stalled, as has climate policy."
"On these matters it is researchers and the European Parliament that are showing leadership - the Council has failed!"
"The Council has provided a loophole for forestry, shipping and airlines in the climate negotiations."
"Where is the money for the developing countries - the specific EUR 30 billion called for by Parliament?"
"What happened to the emissions targets?"
"Parliament called for reductions of 32-40 percent."
"Now we hear that the documents the Council is working on water down our emissions targets even further."
"The Council's climate policy has such large holes in it that it can only be compared with a fishing net for catching whales!"
"Finally, I would like to mention Vattenfall."
"Stop Vattenfall's legal proceedings!"
"They are obstructing our work on climate change."
"You have power over this enterprise."
"At the very least, you should make sure that Vattenfall minds its own business and stops calling into question the environmental legislation of Germany and the EU."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Government for its Presidency of this Council."
"It took office with a very heavy agenda and has been able to achieve a great deal, much of which we welcome."
"I have spoken in this Chamber repeatedly of the need to reinvigorate the Lisbon strategy; the European Union has, for far too long, pursued political and institutional reform with a degree of energy and determination which it has simply been unable to muster for economic reform."
"Yet our global trading position, relative economic weight and international competitiveness are in jeopardy."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's EU 2020 initiative, now endorsed by the European Council, and I congratulate particularly Mr Barroso for his part in this."
"The future prosperity and well-being of our citizens depend on a dynamic economy able to generate jobs and wealth by unleashing the creative energies of entrepreneurs and by stimulating the growth of successful businesses."
"Part of this economic regeneration will be the greening of our economies, and we all hope that an agreement in Copenhagen this week will draw up a realistic framework to tackle climate change whilst facilitating economic growth and development."
"On the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, we support the principle that the Member States of the Union must cooperate more to combat problems related to immigration, cross-border crime and terrorism."
"But these are also areas which lie at the heart of national sovereignty; and defending the laws and ensuring security and protecting the public are amongst the most important duties of a democratic state."
"We must therefore balance the need for joint action with respect for the rights of our Member States."
"Parts of the Stockholm Programme simply fail to get the balance right."
"Some of the proposals will simply centralise power, create unnecessary expense and add further bureaucracy for very little added value."
"Our priorities must lie in the direction of fitness to compete, deregulation, innovation and job creation."
"The people of Europe deserve nothing less."
"(SV) Mr President, I would also like to give the Swedish Presidency top marks for its organisational skills."
"The Swedish national administration has lived up to everyone's expectations."
"Unfortunately, I cannot be as positive when it comes to my political evaluation."
"Two areas in particular must come in for criticism."
"Firstly, the matter of transparency and openness."
"Sweden is usually seen as setting an example in this area, but instead it has taken a passive approach - and that is a particularly serious matter when our citizens' freedom of communication is at stake."
"Allow me to mention in this respect the directive on data retention, the telecoms package and the secret ACTA agreement."
"There have been demands for the Presidency to act to make the documents available, as has been possible since the 2001 amendment to the Regulation on transparency - which states that the public shall have access to all the documents relating to ongoing international negotiations."
"Why has the Swedish Presidency not acted on this?"
"The second area is climate change and, in my opinion, the way that poor countries are being betrayed by our use of aid funds to mitigate the worst of the damage for which the rich world has been, and still is, responsible."
"This despite the fact that the climate convention, the Bali Plan and the Kyoto Protocol all state that funding to finance climate measures must be new funding."
"Once again, it is the most vulnerable who are having to foot the bill for the actions of the rich countries."
"It is those who do not have clean water, those threatened by malaria, those suffering from HIV and, above all, the poorest women and children of the world who are now having to pay the price."
"This policy is a shameful way to treat the poorer parts of the world."
"(DE) Mr President, the Swedish Presidency is now coming to an end - with no great disasters, but, in my opinion, without any outstanding successes, either."
"In any case, the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved."
"We have pumped billions into a system from which only a few benefit, whereas the public has to bear the risks and the costs."
"It is unacceptable for European taxpayers' hard-earned money to end up in the bonus pots of bank managers."
"If we are already holding a climate summit, then, in my opinion, we also need, at long last, a truer reflection of costs and some honesty in the debate about nuclear reactors."
"If we are looking for climate protection solutions, we also need to put a stop to the deception surrounding emissions certificates."
"In the case of the SWIFT negotiations, the Swedish Presidency has, in my opinion, allowed itself to be dictated to somewhat by the US with regard to the disclosure of bank data."
"As a result of this and of the Stockholm Programme, citizens are becoming ever easier to manipulate and ever more transparent."
"With Sweden, Turkey is also losing an advocate for its accession."
"In my view, it is time to stop the accession negotiations and offer Turkey a privileged partnership."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say thank you."
"Despite many problems, the Swedish Council Presidency has done a splendid job."
"Sweden is a medium-sized country in the European Union and we should view that as a positive thing in all respects."
"I would like to thank you and your entire government, Mr Reinfeldt."
"With the climate, the financial market crisis, the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Commission, you have had really difficult tasks and issues to deal with."
"I would like to single out two issues."
"The first is the financial market crisis."
"The fact that, together with the Commission, Sweden remained firm with regard to the consolidation efforts of individual Member States is extremely positive."
"The fact that you did not say 'we will now release Greece from its responsibilities within the euro area' is something that I can only wholeheartedly support."
"The second area is climate policy."
"We have listened to the criticism from the Communists and the Greens."
"They do not have any actual responsibility anywhere in Europe."
"We can pursue climate policy in the style of China or the US by making grand proclamations but not achieving any results."
"Europe has achieved results."
"I reject the claim that Greenpeace is the yardstick for European climate policy."
"We must remain realistic!"
"Here, too, the Swedish Presidency surprisingly achieved very good results during its term, together with the Commission."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks for this, too."
"With regard to the subject of the Treaty of Lisbon: Mr Schulz is not here at the moment."
"He said that the Commission is influenced by it being made up of deputy leaders of European parties."
"I am only surprised that the chair of a political group wants to make an issue of the political commitment of individual members of the Commission."
"What is the point of that?"
"I can only reject that argument."
"Finally, I would like to encourage you - as I did when you took office - to finally join the euro."
"Can I say 'Sweden ante portas', Mr Reinfeldt?"
"Mr President, in all fairness, I believe the Swedish Presidency can be satisfied with its achievements, and I think that Sweden can be proud of the performance of the Swedish Presidency."
"However, as always with the short-term presidencies, when they are good, they leave us with a bitter feeling of a somehow unaccomplished job."
"Therefore, I believe the most important question now is: how and what could we further build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency?"
"The first thing is the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"A treaty is never enough for solving a problem."
"Political will is always needed in order to enhance it properly but, in this case, I think that we need even more than will."
"We need courage and imagination - imagination to fill the gaps or to clarify the ambiguities of the treaty."
"Therefore, I hope that, starting with the experience it has accumulated, the Swedish Presidency will still remain involved in supporting the building of the new institution which the Lisbon Treaty has created, namely the permanent - or long-term - President of the European Council and the office of High Representative with the External Action Service."
"One of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency was, of course, the management of the economic and financial crisis."
"This was very important."
"Against this background, I think two phenomena which are quite threatening have been observed: firstly, the temptation of national protectionism and national egoism, and, secondly, the economic and social disparities between our Member States and the lack of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union."
"Should we call into question the wisdom of enlargement?"
"Certainly not."
"These disparities were already there before, and interdependence is valid not only within the Union but globally."
"Therefore, these disparities were able to undermine or to put in jeopardy the stability of the whole continent and the Union."
"Therefore, I think that enlargement made it possible for the new Member States to cope with these disparities better inside the Union, for the profit of all Members of the Union."
"But the conclusion is as follows, and I will end here."
"I believe that the next step is to pursue bolder and more substantial policies of territorial, economic and social cohesion in Europe - and not fewer policies of this kind - together with bold reforms, financial and economic reforms which would allow us not to repeat the crisis, and, certainly, with policies for post-crisis rehabilitation."
"In this context, the last statement of the Commission concerning economic support for eastern countries, as well as the readiness expressed by Mr Barroso to debate the 2020 Strategy, should be commended."
"(FR) Mr President, I, too, would like to express my gratitude to the Swedish Presidency-in-Office of the European Council, but there remains one problem."
"On Thursday, the European Council took the decision to grant EUR 7.2 billion to finance developing countries' partial adaptation to climate change, which is all to the good."
"From my point of view, this amount should be in addition to the development aid that the European Union has pledged to increase to 0.7% of gross national income by 2015."
"Why?"
"Let us suppose that the EUR 7.2 billion comes from the package that has already been allocated as official development aid; this sum will not be enough to finance the Millennium Development Goals."
"It would be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"We await clarification from the European Council and the Commission on this matter."
"Any ambiguity surrounding the complementary nature of the amount announced by the European Council of 10 and 11 December would undermine the European Union's credibility at the Copenhagen conference, which we have no hesitation in describing as crucial to the future of mankind."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I represent the European Free Alliance part of my group which includes the independence parties of Wales, Flanders, Catalonia and Scotland."
"We seek independent status so that our nations can contribute to European Council meetings and to world events such as the Copenhagen conference on climate change."
"The government and the parliament of Scotland have adopted the world's most ambitious climate change act, with emission reduction targets of 42% by 2020 and 80% by 2050."
"These are targets which we mean to achieve, and yet the UK Government refused a reasonable request for a Scottish minister to be part of the official proceedings in Copenhagen."
"Such behaviour only underlines the fact that it is only with independence - the normal status of independence - that Scotland can properly contribute to the international community, and I hope that the European Council will very soon be discussing internal enlargement of the European Union, with Scotland leading the way."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy."
"That fact that I admire so many Swedish traditions made me all the more disappointed by the overall balance sheet of their activities."
"Unfortunately, it was not a presidency of the people, but rather a presidency of the Council and also a large-scale investor presidency in the style of Mrs Wallström rather than that of Mrs Malmström."
"Mrs Malmström, I remember you well from the time you were an MEP here."
"During this presidency, you have been a rather different person."
"I very much hope that when you return, you will pick up where you left off when you were here, namely being inspired by the parliamentary system."
"Why did you adopt SWIFT at such a late stage?"
"Why do we now have a kind of executive board at EU level - this being one of the objectives of the Swedes, of all people, with their transparency?"
"Please use your future to return to your roots."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last two and a half hours of this debate, quite a great deal has been said about Copenhagen and the Copenhagen negotiations."
"I must say that, in this respect, the Swedish Presidency has not been entirely successful as there is no common position being presented in Copenhagen for the European Union."
"This is not necessarily the Swedish Presidency's fault, but rather the European Commission's."
"What is going on and why is there no common position?"
"There is no common position on at least two issues."
"One of these issues is whether carbon dioxide quotas can be transferred after 2012 and whether they can then be sold as well."
"The European Commission criticises this position in an incomprehensible, short-sighted and narrow-minded manner."
"Hungary, Poland, Romania and other former socialist countries have fulfilled their Kyoto commitments."
"In fact, not only have they met them, but they have even overfulfilled them."
"We are entitled to the right to sell excess quotas."
"However, the Commission still wants to take this from us."
"In other words, they want to punish contractual compliance, which Hungary has also shown."
"Others have failed to keep their commitments, even increasing their harmful emissions, but no one wants to punish them."
"After this, how can we expect the signatories to comply with a new agreement, that is, if there will be a sequel to Kyoto in Copenhagen?"
"I urge the European Commission, and if he were here, I would urge and emphatically call on President Barroso to change the narrow-minded attitude he has shown so far and stand for a position which complies with the current Kyoto Protocol in force."
"I would also like to draw your attention to a fact that we should not forget, namely, that without the new Member States, the EU15 would not have been able to meet their 8% emission reduction commitment."
"In fact, if this had been the case, the European Union would have a much poorer and weaker negotiating position in Copenhagen."
"(FR) Presidents, Minister, the Swedish Presidency has had what may be described as some historic moments: the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appointments of the first President of the European Council and of the High Representative, but also the climate change conference and the appointment of a new Commission, as well as - please allow me this brief reference - the telecoms package."
"These events have created hope."
"All things considered, however, there remain one or two mixed results."
"Firstly, our Parliament, being committed to the introduction of European supervision of the financial markets, welcomed the proposals made by Mr de Larosière's group of wise men as a crucial step."
"However, the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December are well below this realistic level of ambition."
"I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust."
"The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change."
"Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years."
"This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise."
"Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation."
"I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy."
"This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years."
"There is still work to be done."
"Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge."
"As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come."
"(SV) Mr President, it is rather odd to hear some of the whiners - including some of my fellow Swedes - criticising the Swedish Presidency."
"With what is Carl Schlyter comparing this Presidency?"
"With the Czech Republic, or some other great presidency?"
"Neither should anyone expect to get good marks from Mr Borghezio."
"In fact, getting poor marks from Mr Borghezio is a good result."
"A lot has been done."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has come into force."
"The two highest posts in the EU have been filled."
"A number of important proposals have been laboriously pushed through: the Stockholm Programme, future financial supervision and especially the telecoms package."
"The climate summit in Copenhagen could also move in the right direction if we in the European Parliament want it to."
"On the minus side, I would mention the failure to implement patient mobility."
"It represents continued legal uncertainty and unnecessary suffering as people wait for treatment."
"Overall, however, all credit to Prime Minister Reinfeldt, to Mrs Malmström, the Minister for European Union Affairs, and to all the other members of the Presidency team."
"You all deserve a Happy New Year!"
"(NL) Mr President."
"Mr Reinfeldt, there is one serious blemish on your Presidency, and that is the decisions taken regarding SWIFT."
"The Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December, and on 30 November, you and your fellow Heads of State or Government rushed through an arrangement giving our bank details to the United States."
"If this is an indication of the future development of the Stockholm Programme - a programme intended to guarantee our civil rights, security and freedom - then my impression is that its implementation will really tip the scales and put freedom and civil rights under threat."
"This is a blemish on your Presidency."
"I also think it besmirches the launch of the Treaty of Lisbon, which gives the European Parliament more rights, and I should like your assurance that, in future, you will show more respect for civil rights, citizens and Parliament."
"(HU) Mr President, we would like to assess the results of the Swedish Presidency retrospectively from a 10-20 year perspective."
"The most important event that will be mentioned is the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force."
"This Treaty creates the legal framework for a super state, with the lives of 500 million people being controlled from a central point and the nation states withering away."
"The path leading us to this was antidemocratic."
"Three referendums rejected this concept until the imposed second Irish referendum and the acquisition of Václav Klaus's signature created the opportunity for it to happen."
"The majority of Europe's population rejected this concept, and they want to hold on to the nation state."
"This is why I am confident that history will portray this period as a frustrated attempt to create an empire."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in debates about the Council Presidency, we often talk as if the Presidency was the European Union."
"The Council Presidency is not the EU; it is an important manager of a European institution."
"I would therefore ask everyone to be a bit fairer and calmer."
"The Council Presidency has done a good job over the last six months."
"It has helped to open a new chapter in the history of European Union success."
"However, none of us wants a Europe of governments."
"We are working towards a Europe of the citizens and towards greater cooperation between the institutions and the various parts of the European Union."
"Each one of us is a part of the European Union."
"The institutional debate has been closed, the new posts have been filled and, on a few important points, the Council has moved into a position that will enable us to continue to work."
"Let us look to the future."
"Someone said that we have a major problem because the Treaty of Lisbon has not yet been taken into account in the working methods of the Council."
"The Council has more opportunities to influence the European Parliament and the committees of the European Parliament than the European Parliament has to influence the working groups and the Council meetings."
"In this respect, too, we demand the equal treatment of the two institutions, as we have equal status as legislators."
"Yes, it was a mistake - we can argue about the content - to push SWIFT through in advance of the change in Parliament's power of codecision one day later."
"The decision on financial market supervision has still not been finalised."
"We need to make improvements, we need executive power, we need more European supervision where cross-border institutions are concerned and we need to achieve better coordination between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank in the Basel Committee, because otherwise, a parallel structure will be created."
"(ES) Mr President, I want to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its work, particularly with respect to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon represents a qualitative step and requires the next presidencies - Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian - to continue the difference made by the Swedish Presidency with the Stockholm Programme in drafting the action plan."
"In the context of the cooperation that is required under the Treaty of Lisbon between the European Commission, Council and Parliament and the national Parliaments of the Member States (Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 295 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), I would like to draw attention to the importance of three points that have been emphasised by the Swedish Presidency."
"The first is related to the ambiguity surrounding the coordinator on anti-terrorism and illicit trafficking in persons and the extent to which this official is dependent on the Commission and, conversely, subject to control by the European Parliament."
"The second is the external dimension of fundamental rights, which will now be a cross-cutting dimension of European politics."
"While there is a Commissioner dedicated to fundamental rights and justice, the European Union also has an External Action Service which must commit to human rights and to strong involvement in the defence of fundamental rights."
"The third relates to the Schengen area for the free movement of persons."
"We believe that the fact that importance has been attached to evaluating and monitoring the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and to the external border control policy (asylum, immigration and prevention of organised crime) will lead to success in creating this area of free circulation of persons and human rights, thus completing the internal market and realising our European project."
"(SV) Mr President, building bridges is never easy."
"It is particularly difficult when we need to get 27 Member States and 500 million people across those bridges, making the transition from the old EU to a more open, more transparent and more democratic EU under the new Treaty of Lisbon, with the European Parliament now having a much greater influence."
"This autumn, we have had both a climate crisis and a jobs crisis to contend with."
"Despite this, the Swedish Presidency has succeeded in putting in place a number of pieces of incredibly important legislation on energy efficiency."
"I am particularly pleased that the EU has now introduced energy labelling of domestic appliances."
"Other examples of legislation that has now been introduced include energy efficiency requirements for buildings and environmental labelling of vehicle tyres."
"Finally, I would like to thank the government for its effective, coherent Presidency."
"I would particularly like to express my respect for EU Ambassador Ulrika Barklund Larsson, who was taken from us so suddenly this autumn."
"She did a fantastic job and we greatly miss her."
"All that remains now is to conclude the climate conference in Copenhagen - the last and most important task, with the greatest long-term impact."
"Good luck!"
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points in the conclusions arising out of the latest European Council on which we should be able to agree and which we could describe as encouraging for the immediate future."
"Firstly, immigration: the need to make access to European Union territory more efficient in terms of guaranteeing the safety of its citizens was highlighted."
"To do this, we need an integration policy."
"In other words, we need to strike the right balance between the needs of the Member States and the human drama, the productive potential of migrants."
"Reference was then made to a Europe of responsibilities and solidarity where immigration and asylum are concerned."
"In this sense, I am encouraged by the way the Council stressed the urgent need to combat illegal immigration, starting with the border Member States, particularly in the south."
"This means sharing resources and problems."
"Unfortunately this aspect is all too often overshadowed by selfishness and a lack of courage."
"The second aspect that I consider to be a priority, at this time of economic crisis, when we still cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, is the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We must be able to get back to competing with the emerging powers on a financial and commercial level as quickly as possible: only a state-of-the-art research and information system will allow us to take this step, which is so vital for us and, above all, for new generations."
"I am pleased to note that the new method invoked by the Council aims to strengthen the link between national measures and European Union measures and to strengthen national ownership through more active involvement of management and labour and of the regional and local authorities, which can be summed up in one word: subsidiarity."
"I still feel that we must do more in this direction: the family, people and intermediate groups must be at the centre of Europe's economic recovery."
"Only people, in fact, only men and women possess the original dynamism that can reactivate the many sectors of our social lives, now bowed down by the pessimism that all too often comes from the institutions."
"(ET) Mr President, first I would like to praise the chair for the approval of the Baltic Sea Strategy, which is certainly very important for my home country. I would, however, like to speak a bit longer on three points regarding the subject of finance."
"First, I would like to express thanks for the efforts made on the regulation of the trans-European financial system, and also to call on the European Parliament, for its part, to give maximum support to this."
"Second, in order to control the financial crisis, the European Union and its Member States have implemented a large number of exceptional measures, which is very positive."
"It is already possible to see stabilisation in the economy."
"At the same time, I agree with the Council that the situation is not yet secure enough for us to give up the support measures."
"The consequence of the crisis, for me, is definitely the fact that banks are necessary and the services they provide are necessary."
"It is not necessary, therefore, to go too far in punishing them, but banking activities should be based on what is happening in the real economy, not on an inter-bank virtual market, which was the main reason for the recent crisis."
"At the same time, we need to consider the payment of bankers' bonuses, an issue which has become a particularly important topic in Estonia."
"Third, in relation to this, I support the appeals to the International Monetary Fund to consider instituting a charge on global financial transactions - the Tobin tax - in order to give back money to society in the boom times."
"I support the necessity of renewing economic and social agreements between financial institutions and the society they serve, and to increase the benefits to society in good times and protect it from dangers."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Swedish Presidency, particularly Prime Minister Reinfeldt, on behalf of both the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Portuguese delegation within the PPE Group."
"Our verdict on the Swedish Presidency is that it has been an almost total success, basically in four fundamental areas."
"Firstly, in the institutional area, the Swedish Presidency's contribution to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, to the highly successful election of the President of the Commission and to everything associated with ratification was extremely professional and at the level that we expect for best practice in the European Union."
"Of course, for a country like Portugal, which played a decisive role in the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Swedish Presidency's contribution was invaluable."
"My second point is the climate agenda, where, of course, the Commission's efforts have also been extremely important In my view and that of many of my colleagues in the PPE, the climate change area is where the European Union has been most successful."
"It is at the very forefront of the global fight, and that is due to the efforts of both the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, the Commission Presidency."
"We consider these results to be very positive as well."
"My third point is financial regulation."
"Especially with this latest Council, there has been a step forwards that we regard as decisive and which may have a great impact on our emergence from the crisis."
"I would therefore also like to pass on our congratulations for having achieved an agreement in that area."
"Lastly, I would like to mention an area that is very important to me personally: the Stockholm Programme and, therefore, the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I followed both the Tampere process and subsequently, in particular, the Hague process."
"I regard the Stockholm Programme as absolutely essential and would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and Prime Minister Reinfeldt on it."
"(EL) Mr President, the results of the Swedish Presidency are truly positive."
"They coincide with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks the end of the intergovernmentalism which has caused us problems for so many years and the exercising of a more integrated and cohesive policy."
"The Swedish Presidency is also characterised by the creation of the Stockholm Programme and the decisions taken during the financial crisis, which are truly important, pivotal points in further developments in this endeavour."
"At the same time, the election of the President of the European Commission and the appointments made, all of which are hugely important to developments in the endeavour we are making via the Lisbon Treaty, are especially important and interesting to the European Parliament and are positive and essential elements."
"The European Parliament is taking on a new role as a legislative body alongside the European Council."
"This marks a new development in which we must all make greater and more cohesive efforts."
"(ES) Mr President, I congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its commendable leadership over the last six months."
"Regarding the Stockholm Programme, I would highlight the fact that it is trying to give impetus to longed-for common immigration policy. However, certain essential issues have been relegated to secondary status."
"Within the European Union in 2008, there were 515 terrorist attacks in 11 Member States."
"Combating terrorism and protection of victims must therefore be included among the priorities of our political agenda, and must constitute a separate, specific category of the Stockholm Programme."
"Secondly, eight million irregular immigrants live within the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In that regard, we must strengthen policies for development and cooperation with countries of origin and transit."
"The European Union must promote the conclusion of repatriation and readmission agreements with countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Libya."
"The future action plan of the Stockholm Programme, to be presented in mid-June 2010, must consider these aspects."
"(PL) I, too, would like to add my voice to the expressions of thanks which are being made to the Swedish Presidency, and to Mr Reinfeldt personally for his efficiency, and also for the excellent way in which he has achieved the priorities of the presidency."
"Of course, what is important for European Union citizens is, in particular, action intended to reduce the effects of the economic and financial crisis."
"This is related to support for the business sector, in order to restore jobs and create conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to develop, as well as to eliminate the causes of the crisis, particularly in financial markets, so that they will not be repeated in the future."
"It seems to me that European supervision in this area is insufficient, and that here we must also influence, as a democratically elected institution, the ethical standards followed by those who supervise banks and financial institutions."
"Concerning the Copenhagen Summit, I fully endorse the position stated by Mr Barroso."
"Here, there is, indeed, a need for partnership on the part of other important economic players for the effects of the summit to be truly attainable."
"(RO) I was the rapporteur for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which I negotiated on second reading with the Swedish Presidency of the European Union Council."
"This is an extremely important report for the future of the European Union and the battle against climate change."
"It is also significant for the Copenhagen conference, but especially for the 2.7 million jobs which may be created in this sector by 2020."
"With regard to comitology, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, negotiations have started on an institutional agreement on powers and procedures delegated by the Commission."
"Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Lisbon creates a new basis both for climate change and a common energy policy, I hope, and we also expect it from the European Commission, President Barroso, that you will present to us a programme of work for the next five years, so that the commissioners we listen to can respond to these challenges as well."
"As a final point, I would like to mention the lifting of the barriers to free movement of labour in the case of workers from the new Member States, which should be a final action by the Swedish Presidency."
"I must apologise to Mr Balčytis and Mr Luhan: I cannot comply with their request because we already have numerous other speakers and we do not have enough time to let everyone speak."
"They will have to save it for another time."
"I apologise once again."
"(SL) I should like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for leading the European Union fairly and responsibly at a time, as you said, of institutional change and of economic and financial crisis."
"However, you may have missed the opportunity during this period to promote a broader European discourse on a socio-economic model different to the one which led us into this crisis."
"Sweden knows much more about this than some other countries."
"You have also experienced the bitter realisation of the limitations of the European Union when it comes to unity of action, especially at the time we were electing the EU's leadership."
"You have set a few new standards in the field of foreign policy, in the Middle East, for example, and I congratulate you on that achievement."
"Thank you also for the attention you have paid to the enlargement of the European Union and for resolving, together with the Commission, some unfinished issues which stood in the way of this process."
"A job well done!"
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, I would like to know your view, Mr Reinfeldt, on the conclusions of the Troika, since the Heads of State or Government decided to create this troika concept in order to give a sense of continuity to the Presidency."
"Furthermore, since you are concluding the Troika between the French Republic, the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden, what is your view on this instrument and what conclusion do you draw from it?"
"(PL) Mr President, We meet here in Parliament every six months to summarise the achievements of another country as it ends its leadership of the European Union."
"The Swedish Presidency will go down in history because its term saw the pushing through of the Euro-constitution, for which some had been agitating for nearly 10 years, and which in its current form is known as the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This was done against the will of many nations."
"The results of referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland were ostentatiously brushed aside."
"The principle of a democracy deficit was introduced, which allows control from above, ostensibly to improve EU administrative mechanisms."
"The first changes related to the selection of people for new positions in the Union have, for the time being, brought in organisational chaos and caused general amusement in Europe and around the world."
"The Swedish Presidency is, in fact, leaving the European Union in a state of uncertainty and chaos."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the vision of a citizen-centred Europe laid down in the Stockholm Programme."
"We can never underline enough the historic importance of finally having a vision that meets our citizens' concerns for security and, at the same time, for respecting individual rights."
"Finally, we can move forward to a Europe for the citizen, by the citizen."
"I also would like to welcome the Asylum Support Office, which is an important and concrete step towards meeting the concerns of countries that want to fight illegal immigration while, at the same time, providing for a more humane migration policy."
"The Stockholm Programme will remain with us for five years, and I hope we can move forward to implementation."
"I thank the Swedish Presidency."
"Your footprint will remain with us for five years."
"(HU) The Swedish Presidency has done an excellent job, and I would like to congratulate the prime minister for this."
"The final completion of the Treaty of Lisbon's ratification resolved the regrettable and disgraceful mini-crisis involving the Czech President Klaus."
"This situation resulted from the political mistake made during the enlargement process where the European Union did not declare earlier that the 13 discriminatory Beneš Decrees were morally untenable."
"The second major event is that the EU managed to establish a united position for the climate change negotiations."
"The US and China have still not realised this fact, but the European Union clearly understands that the future belongs to whoever now leads the way in green economic development."
"Let us not forget that the only reason the EU was able to achieve its targets was that the new Member States had reduced their emissions significantly."
"Finally, the third major event was that accession negotiations got under way with Serbia, and Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were granted visa-free travel."
"I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for creating an excellent opportunity for the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on the six months of relentless and very ambitious work it has done, notably by securing, alongside the Heads of State or Government and within the scope of the G20, a common and ambitious position on financial regulation matters."
"When it comes to the Copenhagen conference, too, we see that the European Union has an ambitious, very elevated, very proactive and common position."
"I would like therefore to endorse its positions and its decisions."
"Europe has been a driving force behind the proposal, negotiation and conclusion of major agreements concerning this financial crisis, which affects the whole of Europe."
"The European Council also gave its verdict, last week, on the new financial supervisory architecture, and negotiations with the European Parliament have been opened since, from now on, the responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the decisions taken in Pittsburgh will also be shared by the European Parliament."
"The financial crisis has revealed the weak points in our financial supervision system."
"The idea was to ensure better coordination, but also to renew and strengthen the powers of European authorities; these are urgent requirements."
"I hope - and I am addressing the Commission here - that we remain vigilant and maintain this level of ambition when implementing our decisions."
"Mr President, this morning I want to express my extreme disappointment, on behalf of the Northern Ireland fishing industry, that yet another cut has been imposed upon the industry."
"Last night's announcement from the Council that there will be a 9% cut in nephrops in Area 7A is a bitter blow to the fishing industry in Northern Ireland."
"It is a fragile industry because of the cod recovery programme and because of the cuts in the days at sea."
"It is an industry that has had to rely on nephrops."
"This 9% cut will be devastating, and it is particularly galling since the science this year should have allowed the Commission to have a roll-over."
"I think that the priority for the Spanish in the next term must be the reform of the common fisheries policy and for decisions like this to be taken at regional level by local, accountable people, and not Brussels bureaucrats."
"(PL) During the Swedish Presidency, a great deal of good has happened in the Union, in what has been, of course, a difficult period of crisis and expectations concerning acceptance of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I do not, however, share the opinion that we have a different Union or a new Union."
"I think we have, at most, a renewed Union."
"In fact, the general provisions of the treaty must be supplemented, not only with detailed content, but also with specific practical solutions."
"It is important to clarify the division of competences between key posts, and how we establish relations between EU institutions, including the new role of the European Parliament"
"My fears are aroused by possible restrictions on the function of the rotating presidency held by successive Member States."
"This leadership role is something Member States prepare for and discharge with great determination."
"If, alongside the permanent President of the European Council, we do not also have the leader of the country which currently has the leadership giving reports here, the Union will be incomplete and will lose some of its diversity."
"The countries which lead must still creatively inspire new action, and the permanent President of the European Council will have to ensure coordination, continuity and cohesion of the Union's work."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, coming to the end of this debate, we are also coming to the end of the last presidency on the rotating principle, as has been mentioned."
"Soon, José Manuel Barroso and I will leave for Copenhagen, so just a comment on financial resources, because I think that will be at the heart of the discussions we will now have with the developing countries."
"We were able to put a figure on the table - EUR 2.4 billion annually - between 2010 and 2012."
"The importance for us was to say that this is directed to these years, earmarked for 2010 to 2012, and it will also be available for support when it comes to climate protection."
"The discussion on how to meet the Millennium Development Goals is an important discussion."
"I want to point out that the Member States have agreed that we should commit ourselves to disbursing collectively 0.56% of EU GNI by 2010, that is, already next year, and coming up to the UN percentage level of 0.7 in 2015 when it comes to official development assistance."
"This is very much in the hands of the Member States."
"To point out the obvious, very many of the Member States are below these figures today."
"Sweden is in a very exclusive club, almost alone at 1% of GNI when it comes to development assistance."
"This should also be remembered when we discuss these levels: that there are differences between the countries."
"We made it voluntary for the Member States to give the resources that they were able to give."
"I am very happy to report back that all 27 Member States made contributions to these fast-start resources."
"In some cases, they were very small contributions, but the European voice is heard in the sense that everyone actually contributed."
"Thank you again also for the cooperation we have had with Parliament."
"It is the fourth time during the Swedish Presidency that I, as Prime Minister, have addressed this Parliament."
"That does not even come close to Cecilia Malmström's number of engagements with Parliament, because she has been here 25 times to speak to you."
"In all, the Presidency has addressed Parliament in plenary on 43 occasions during our term in office and we have been in committee on 44 different occasions."
"That is also important when it comes to the discussions on transparency and good cooperation between the institutions."
"We knew of the importance of having a good link with the European Parliament."
"We prepared ourselves to be present, to be here, to be able to answer questions, and we thank you for that very good cooperation."
"Prime Minister, in two weeks' time, your presidency of the European Union will come to an end."
"Thank you for your activity and for your energy."
"It has not been an easy presidency; we know that."
"As we heard from our Members, and the many points of view expressed, it has been a successful presidency."
"I wish to thank you personally and, indeed, the entire Swedish Government."
"For the first time in history, we experienced, over the last few weeks, new relations as a result of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Thank you very much."
"We will remember your presidency."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to answer some of the concrete questions from the Members of Parliament who are still here."
"For instance, Mr Severin spoke about economic, social and territorial cohesion, and I want to underline the point he made."
"In fact, in the first exchange of views which we had in the European Council on the future European Union 2020 Strategy, it was agreed - see point 18 of the conclusions - that every effort should be made to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion as well as gender equality."
"I think it is important to have this from the beginning of the discussion of the European Union 2020 Strategy."
"Of course, the emphasis is on competitiveness and the need to respond to the global challenges which we are now facing, but we should do that in conjunction with promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union."
"This is going to be very important, not only for the definition of this strategy, but also for the next financial perspectives."
"Another concrete point regarding the European supervisory authorities was raised, namely by Mr Karas and also by Ms Dati."
"Let me be clear on this matter."
"We very much welcome the fact that the European Council was able to reach a unanimous agreement."
"Frankly, some time ago, it would have been inconceivable to have all the Member States agreeing on a text on financial supervision at European level."
"Having said this, while I respect the delicate nature of some of the issues addressed by our proposals, I believe the Commission's text has been diluted a bit too much."
"The Commission, in its proposal, had foreseen a simple and workable fiscal safeguard clause, precisely because this is a very sensitive matter."
"Anyway, I regret the removal of the proposed powers of the authorities to address decisions directly to individual financial institutions in two out of the three situations where the Commission had proposed it."
"I regret the fact that the issue of emergency situations has been politicised by giving the Council the responsibility of declaring that an emergency exists, and I also regret that the potential scope of direct supervision by the European supervisory authorities has been limited to credit-rating agencies only."
"I hope the European Parliament will reinforce and rebalance the regulations in these areas in the next negotiating phase."
"Coming to the issue of Copenhagen, and let me be clear about this: it was very important that the European Council confirmed the previous commitments saying that we are ready to move to a 30% reduction by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respected capabilities."
"We will continue to assess mitigation plans from other countries and take this decision at the appropriate time in Copenhagen."
"In fact, during the European Council, I had mentioned the possibility of having some modulation in our offer, namely the possibility of constructing some pathways beyond 2020."
"This discussion is not just about 2020; it is for after 2020."
"So we should have some flexibility on the pathways that we can define after 2020."
"It is in this spirit that we go to Copenhagen not only to achieve the most ambitious agreement but also to have a real global agreement."
"President Barroso, thank you once again."
"I would like to thank Prime Minister Reinfeldt, Minister Malmström, a former Member of the European Parliament, and the whole of the Swedish Government for their very active cooperation with the European Parliament."
"That concludes the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on constructively and effectively implementing the goals of its programme."
"Sweden put considerable effort into ensuring the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December this year, and this means that the European Union will become more democratic, more efficient and more transparent."
"I am sure that the treaty will improve continuity and will strengthen the EU's role in the international arena."
"The EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region was endorsed during the Swedish Presidency."
"I am delighted that financial support has been earmarked for the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region."
"As a Lithuanian, I know all too well the challenges that the Baltic Sea region faces today."
"One of these is how best to resolve the urgent and serious problem of protecting the Baltic Sea environment."
"Another is how to transform the Baltic Sea region into a more powerful engine for economic growth and development."
"We can already find preliminary answers to these questions today in the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region adopted during the Swedish Presidency."
"It is the first of several European macro-regional development plans, through which we hope to improve the region's environment and strengthen its competitiveness."
"The strategy of the Stockholm Programme is one of the most important priorities achieved by Sweden."
"This five-year programme will create conditions to further develop an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The six months of the Swedish Presidency under Prime Minister Reinfeldt have been a great success and marked by excellence."
"The Swedish Presidency played a crucial role in the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It thus ended almost a decade of debate and institutional stalemate, opening the door to new opportunities for the European Union."
"The fight against climate change is a topic that has always been at the top of its agenda."
"The EU is a leader in this field, as shown by its ambitious proposal to cut emissions by 80% and 95% by 2050."
"It also reached agreement on providing EUR 7.2 billion in funds for developing countries for the next three years."
"The Swedish Presidency has faced the economic crisis and financial turmoil with sound, realistic measures."
"Faced with the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, the EU swiftly adopted special support measures."
"The work of 'preventing' further crises has also been carried out through a new financial supervisory structure."
"The Swedish Presidency has helped to address the crisis and has made Europe stronger, allowing it to continue to forge a path of peace, success and modernity."
"It is a fact that it was during the Swedish Presidency that significant institutional changes were made, particularly the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, after that whole process of pressurising and blackmailing the Irish people into changing their vote in the second referendum they had to hold."
"However, even for someone who really wants an increasingly neoliberal, militaristic and federalist form of European integration, it is unacceptable that he had not a word to say about the terrible social situation that the European Union is experiencing, which can clearly be seen in the rise of over 5 million unemployed in just one year, so that there are now over 23 million people out of work."
"It was quite symptomatic, however, that the spotlight was put on the start of the debate on the EU's strategy for 2020, quite forgetting the evaluation of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, which was approved 10 years ago and promised an oasis in the EU."
"That was doubtless so as not to have to mention the causes of the greatest economic and social crisis in recent decades, fed by liberalisation and labour flexibility, which has created precarious and poorly paid work and increased unemployment."
"Mr President, assessment of the Swedish Presidency yields a very positive result."
"Of course, its greatest success was bringing the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon to completion."
"As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I also consider a success the compromise reached in the Council on EU patents and the integrated system of patent jurisdiction."
"Debate on a common patent for the entire Union has been going on for a long time."
"It is high time to establish specific rules on this, because the lack of uniform regulations constitutes a barrier to the development of European businesses, and makes it difficult for them to compete, for example, with American firms."
"Many times in the past, we have seen how difficult it is to reconcile the interests of all Member States in the matter of the EU patent, and so I am all the more grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the compromise, for the moment, only at the political level, which has been achieved."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives the Union legal grounds to establish intellectual property law, and provides that suitable standards will be adopted under the Ordinary legislative procedure."
"Therefore, during the forthcoming Spanish Presidency, there will be a very interesting debate in Parliament concerning the compromise worked out in December this year."
"in writing. - The green light has been given to the Lisbon Treaty, which has created all necessary circumstances for institutional reforms."
"The Swedish Presidency's role was to pave the way for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty's provisions."
"It coped with this challenge."
"The next Presidency's task is to ensure that the new structures function effectively."
"In this context, every effort should be made to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion and gender equality."
"I find it important to emphasise that with the treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be binding, so human rights (including gender equality) and anti-discrimination issues will have a better chance to be upheld via the law."
"Another success was the drawing-up and approval of the Stockholm Programme, targeting core issues, which can be regarded as a pragmatic action plan for a more secure and more open Europe, based on common values, principles and actions."
"I would like to underline that although gender equality was not a priority, the Swedish Presidency also played a role in increasing the number of women Commissioners and in the appointment of a female High Representative."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened Parliament's role in the European decision-making process and, by extension, the legitimacy of this institution in the eyes of Europe's citizens."
"Consequently, I congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the outstanding efforts made to bring about the new treaty's entry into force."
"I equally welcome the developments in the areas of justice and internal affairs."
"The Stockholm Programme, which was drafted during recent months and voted for at the European Council on 10-11 December, outlines the new reference framework in this area for the 2010-2014 period."
"I am pleased to note that consideration was given to Parliament's recommendations by the Council."
"I am referring, in particular, to the extension of the Schengen area to all EU countries, which now becomes a priority for the European Union's internal policy, following the amendments we tabled."
"I wish to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the six months of ambitious work it has carried out in the difficult climate of the economic and financial crisis, the preparations for the Copenhagen Summit and the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we finally have the clear institutional framework for tackling all the challenges facing the modern world."
"The new treaty enables the EU to firmly assume a pioneering role in the battle against climate change, as well as the status of a global player, not only in relation to the United States and the Russian Federation, but in relation to the emerging countries as well."
"In addition, the new permanent President of the Council and High Representative will ensure continuity in the EU's foreign policy activities, which marks progress in consolidating the EU's role on the world stage."
"As a result of all these institutional changes, the EU will be more efficient and have available a wider range of methods for resolving the major problems facing the international community, such as combating terrorism, adapting to climate change, ensuring energy security and combating the effects of the economic and financial crisis."
"I am sure that the Spanish Presidency will be able to meet expectations and successfully continue the actions and activities initiated by the Swedish Presidency."
"I should like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its work, particularly in those areas that come under the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The challenges were huge: there was the transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to that provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon and also the drafting of the next multiannual programme, which will define the priorities to be given to the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years."
"I wish to commend this Stockholm Programme, which will boost the ambitious political efforts to enhance this area by 2014."
"However, considerable progress remains to be made, and this mainly in the area of asylum."
"I welcome the creation of the European Asylum Support Office, since it is vital to approximate not only the laws but also the practices of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the other proposals in the asylum package will have to be adopted as quickly as possible so as to prevent a third phase of the European Common Asylum System from having to be developed."
"With the major institutional changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, we can now look forward to the imminent adoption of more ambitious and higher quality legislative instruments under the forthcoming presidencies."
"The Swedish Presidency has signified progress through three major actions: - the election of the EU President and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force; - the adoption of the 'Stockholm Multiannual Programme for the 2010-2014 period'; - the preparation and coordination of the COP 15 negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen."
"I welcome the Council's decision on the EU and its Member States being prepared to make a contribution with rapid initial funding of EUR 2.4 billion a year for the 2010-2012 period in order to support developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change."
"However, I call on the Commission to devise a suitable mechanism for distributing the financial burden between Member States according to each one's economic power."
"The 2010 Strategy marks out the direction of the Union's operations and its main priorities for the next 10 years."
"As we come to the end of the Lisbon Strategy, it is important, while continuing with current socio-economic priorities, to find effective means for evening out the effects of the economic crisis."
"In connection with the consultations which are currently under way on the future strategy, I would like to draw attention to two aspects: improvement of the education system in Europe and equality of the sexes in the labour market."
"The education system in Europe must change."
"Building a modern, knowledge-based economy is not possible without young, well-educated workers."
"We should ensure greater financial support for current EU programmes (Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus, Leonardo da Vinci) and establish new initiatives which will help young people to learn and to gain experience abroad, and will also provide the financial and administrative possibilities necessary to use this support at work in their own country."
"The Union, in making a priority of the citizens' needs, should adopt a programme which, in every area of its operation, promotes equality of the sexes, and particularly in the fight against unemployment."
"When planning the new strategy, we should place special emphasis on raising the proportion of women in employment, for research carried out by Eurostat shows that the crisis has affected working women more than men, among other reasons, because they work in jobs which are much less secure."
"Discrimination in the labour market remains a serious problem, and the new strategy must face up to it."
"Despite the difficulties resulting from the delayed entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Swedish Presidency achieved some notable successes."
"They include the energy efficiency package and the telecoms package, the creation of a prudential financial supervisory body, agreement on the 2010 budget, particularly as regards financing the economic recovery plan, the Baltic Sea strategy and alignment for this week's Copenhagen climate conference."
"The Spanish Presidency to begin in 2010 will guide the transition from Nice to Lisbon and will continue the strategy of promoting employment by stimulating and promoting European economies, as well as addressing other major challenges such as financial regulation and climate change."
"Because of its geographical and historical proximity, Portugal and especially the outermost regions such as Madeira, which are looking forward to seeing how the Spanish Presidency performs, must try to make the most of the opportunities that will surely be generated."
"The pioneering EU-Morocco Summit, for example, will be an ideal forum for promoting the Euro-African Atlantic Cooperation Area, which will include Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries and neighbouring countries, especially Morocco."
"I shall put all my efforts into it and will monitor it closely."
"Mr President, the decisions made by the summit signal an escalation in the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and the bourgeois governments and harsh measures against the working class and grassroots sections of society in order to strengthen the profitability and position of European monopolies, both within the framework of the single internal market and in international imperialist competition."
"The EU strategy for 2020, a deeper version of the Lisbon Strategy, sets as priorities faster capitalist restructurings and the demolition of the workers' remaining wage, labour and social rights."
"The cornerstone of the EU exit strategy from the capitalist crisis is to impose sweeping changes in social security systems, to increase the retirement age and to drastically cut wages, pensions and social benefits."
"Deficits and public debt and the procedures for supervising the economies of various Member States, including Greece, are being mobilised in order to ideologically terrorise the workers."
"This anti-grassroots EU policy also bears the hallmark of the PASOK and New Democracy parties, which continue to support the choices of capital, while shifting the consequences of the crisis on to the workers' shoulders."
"The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class to organise its counterattack, to condemn the parties of the European one-way street and to participate en masse in the unemployment rally on 17 December being organised by the class forces of the All Workers Militant Front."

"(For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(CS) I voted against the Böge report on releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund because, particularly in the case of the Austrian request, it involves a highly unsystematic approach which is reflected in an unprecedented high level of support per person."
"If there must be time limited individual support aimed at assisting workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation, such support must relate to real individual needs and the real economic context."
"However, this is not happening and, on the contrary, the procedure for determining this support has been haphazard and arbitrary."
"In my opinion it is therefore necessary to set out firm criteria."
"Using the funds in this way is no solution to the problem but is actually a waste of taxpayers' money."
"Mr President, the reason that I think many of us are interested in trade is really the idea of how we help those in the very poorest countries to get out of poverty."
"We know that one of the best ways to help them out of poverty is to help the entrepreneurs in poorer countries."
"Entrepreneurs in many poorer countries are crying out for help and open markets and it is important that we support them."
"But we also have to look within our own borders to see how we are setting up barriers to facilitating trade with poorer countries."
"In many cases, poorer countries see the trade rules as skewed against them and they look at things like the common agricultural policy, cotton subsidies, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, and the tariffs on higher value imports to the EU."
"It is important that we show that the trading system is truly open and that we help the poorest countries as much as possible to eradicate poverty."
"Mr President, if we are to alleviate poverty in the world, we have to increase global trade."
"If we go down the path of protectionism because of the world's current financial crisis, the only thing we will do is delay bringing millions of people out of poverty, and millions of people will die."
"If we do not grasp this challenge right now and look forward beyond this crisis, we will leave behind a legacy of such awful proportions that a billion people will find themselves unable to live."
"We have a food crisis, we have climate change, we have global warming, we have floods, earthquakes and all sorts of catastrophes which call for our help, and the only way we can uplift everyone is to actually increase global trade, and I am very grateful that the new Trade Commissioner-designate is listening to me."
"(FR) Mr President, concerning this resolution on the World Trade Organisation, and contrary to the opinion voiced by the previous speaker, I believe that it is not international trade that will ensure that fewer than one billion human beings die or suffer from malnutrition, but subsistence farming. It will ensure this long before international trade does."
"I have already had an opportunity to speak on this issue during the debate, and for no other reason than because the amendment concerning public services and the need for governments to be able to control public services relating to fundamental problems such as water and energy has been rejected, I have voted against this resolution."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - We are not laissez-faire capitalists and we do believe in state help for workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own."
"We would want that help to be provided by sovereign states to their own workers."
"We are not, of course, even in favour of EU membership."
"However, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund exists and has had money allocated to it."
"This fund is an unwelcome substitute for help by Member States."
"If it were to be proposed that British workers should be helped from this fund, I would obviously support it."
"Therefore, I must reluctantly support Swedish, Dutch and Austrian workers being supported from it."
"If there should be a No vote, the money would not be handed back to the taxpayer."
"It would be retained by the EU and then perhaps spent on a much less deserving cause."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up to grant additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of major changes in the structure of international trade."
"Portugal, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Austria have already applied to it, which shows that this problem affects Member States in different geographical areas and with different economic models and trajectories."
"Such situations, which are happening at an alarming rate, require decision makers to think carefully about the European economic and social model as well as its sustainability and its future."
"They also mean that it is absolutely crucial to promote ways of creating quality new jobs."
"For these to succeed, we must provide support, remove burdens and cut out unjustifiable red tape for those who are still willing to risk starting new businesses and joining innovative projects, despite the difficulties."
"No matter how much assistance is granted to workers, it will be worthless if companies keep closing down one after the other and if we cannot reverse the investment drain in Europe."
"The cases in question, which I endorse, concern Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands, and they have won broad support in the parliamentary committees concerned, both for tabling the motion for a resolution and for issuing an opinion."
"Although we maintain our critical position regarding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, since we believe it would have been more important to adopt measures to prevent unemployment in the first place, we voted in favour of the mobilisation of this fund to provide further assistance for workers affected by the consequences of company restructuring or the liberalisation of international trade."
"This case concerns the mobilisation of approximately EUR 16 million for Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands in order to provide assistance for workers made redundant in the car making and construction industries."
"This is the fifth time the fund has been mobilised in 2009, making an overall amount of EUR 53 million that has been used out of the EUR 500 million planned."
"It is quite symptomatic that little more than 10% of the planned amount has been used during a period of severe social crisis, and that in itself at least demonstrates the need for a review of the regulations governing the fund."
"I voted in favour of the Böge report on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Its aim is to protect jobs and to make it easier for workers who have been made redundant following changes in the structure of international trade and the global financial and economic crisis to re-enter the labour market."
"Three years on from its creation in 2006, and in the current context of global economic and financial crisis, it was crucial to ease the conditions governing use of this European fund."
"Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are today the target of these more effective and rapid measures, and I look forward to all the EU Member States having greater access to this finance."
"Linked as it is to the financial framework for 2007-2013, the maximum annual amount of the Fund may not exceed EUR 500 million, but it is crucial that these resources are implemented in full, which is not the case today."
"The European Union must use all the resources at its disposal to deal with the consequences of the economic crisis."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the report on the provision of EUR 15.9 million in assistance to Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands."
"As a consequence of the global economic crisis, a total of 744 workers have had to be made redundant in the automotive supply industry in Styria alone."
"The application rightly submitted by Austria for assistance totalling EUR 5 705 365 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has now been approved by the EU."
"That is absolutely justified, as Austria has been hit particularly hard by the slump in exports."
"For example, exports of road vehicles and cars have fallen by 51.3% and 59.4%, respectively."
"As a result of the close interconnection between the companies in the automotive industry and the low-level of diversification of many suppliers, the crisis is being felt throughout the automotive industry."
"Swedish, Austrian and Dutch workers are being sacrificed to globalisation."
"We reiterate our strong opposition to the philosophy underpinning this fund, which makes European workers mere 'adjustment variables' enabling the smooth running of a form of neoliberal globalisation that is never called into question."
"The interests of giants such as the US company Ford, the current owner of Volvo Cars, which cleared a profit of almost USD 1 billion in the third quarter of 2009, or Aviva, Axa and BlackRock, the main shareholders of Heijmans NV, today supplant the general interest of European citizens. The fund is contributing to this despoilment."
"The European Union is an area of solidarity."
"That spirit is the context for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The fund provides essential support to help the unemployed and victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised context."
"That is even more the case when we realise that an increasing number of companies is relocating, taking advantage of the reduced labour costs found in various countries, particularly China and India, often at the price of social, labour and environmental dumping."
"Once again, the consequences of globalisation are having to be cushioned through the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"This time, unfortunately, Styria has also been hard hit."
"A total of 744 people from nine different companies have lost their jobs over the last few months, and that is why the Province of Styria has asked the EU for assistance."
"As with previous applications, everything has been examined very thoroughly and I am pleased that the people of Styria meet all of the requirements."
"Especially during the current financial and economic crisis, we are being very clearly reminded once again of the negative effects of globalisation."
"With that in mind, it is even more incomprehensible that Parliament has today adopted a resolution promoting more liberalisation and the breaking down of trade barriers, and hence more globalisation."
"Until a change of thinking occurs in the EU, we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the countries concerned."
"Therefore, I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund."
"I endorsed mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, because the situation in labour markets today demands that we act on behalf of workers."
"Previous crises were characterised by the fact that they affected specific regions, and were concentrated in one place."
"At such times, all those who lost their jobs or faced financial problems were able to go abroad to find work or could have several jobs."
"Today, in relation to the global character of the financial crisis, such options are not available."
"The current situation in the financial markets requires that we support many millions of people who have lost their jobs over the past year."
"I am not, of course, talking only about help in looking for work, but also about using the elasticity of the labour market, helping workers to gain new qualifications and organising appropriate training, for example, in the use of computers or giving careers advice."
"Most of the money in the EGF should be designated for promoting entrepreneurship and giving assistance with self-employment because, when people have lost their job, setting up a business and generating an income on their own account represents an opportunity to maintain financial stability and to develop."
"I think that programmes like the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are very much needed, because they respond to a specific situation and help directly those who have suffered most from the effects of the crisis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tool that is now being increasingly used by the European Parliament due to the difficult stage of economic convergence our continent is experiencing."
"This shows that, in the face of the crisis, the European Parliament has been able to adopt political measures to benefit the citizens we represent through a synergy of wide-ranging political objectives."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of this Fund in the certainty that it will constitute a fundamental tool of professional and hence social integration for workers who have lost their jobs."
"Sweden has applied for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in respect of redundancies within the automotive sector in Sweden."
"We are convinced that free trade and the market economy benefit economic development and we are therefore, in principle, opposed to financial assistance for countries or regions."
"However, this economic crisis has been deeper than any crisis that Europe has experienced since the 1930s and has hit car manufacturers in Sweden, and Volvo Cars in particular, especially hard."
"The redundancies made by Volvo Cars are considered by the Commission to have a 'significant negative effect on the local and regional economy' in western Sweden. Volvo Cars is a very important employer in western Sweden."
"If the European Parliament does not take action, workers at Volvo Cars and its suppliers will be badly affected."
"The risk of social marginalisation and permanent exclusion is very great, which is something that, as Liberals, we cannot accept."
"We strongly sympathise with all those affected by unemployment and would very much like to see training made available for them."
"Sweden is a net contributor to the EU and it is therefore important that employees in firms operating in Sweden also receive assistance from the EU if they are affected by the economic crisis."
"I abstained from the vote on further mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The vote concerns, among other things, two payments of almost EUR 24 million in total to the car industry in Sweden and Austria."
"Another request concerns a construction company in the Netherlands."
"The car industry is the main beneficiary of this fund, even though it is constantly closing factories, relocating its production, laying off a substantial amount of its workforce and placing its subcontractors in a vulnerable position."
"In addition, it has received other types of financial aid from the Member States within the context of economic recovery plans, as well as other forms of support granted specifically in connection with the policies to combat climate change."
"These funds, which are intended to be used to train people who have been made redundant - a necessary measure if they are to find a new job - are not being granted in return for a commitment by the European car industry not to lay off any more of its workers."
"There is no question of my supporting a policy such as this, since it actually endorses relocations."
"This amending budget clearly reflects the contradictions in the European Union's budgets."
"On one hand, its global values are low in comparison with the needs of the economic and social cohesion policies."
"On the other hand, the funds have not been spent, because the countries that were most in need of that money found it difficult to budget for the required cofinancing."
"Yet they rejected the proposals we tabled for reducing the cofinancing requirements, especially at a time of crisis."
"Such contradictions and irrationalities of Community policy only favour the richest and most developed countries and end up exacerbating social inequalities and regional disparities."
"That is why we voted against it."
"The report itself justifies our position when it stresses that 'there are different reasons for the apparent slow-down in payments compared to the expected rhythm depending on the Member State concerned."
"Firstly, the current economic situation has, in some cases, caused difficulties for the provision of national cofinancing."
"Secondly, the fact that Rural Development implementation in 2009 shows a less dynamic profile than the relevant year of the previous programming period is explained by the late approval of certain programmes as well as, in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, a lack of sufficient previous experience in the implementation of Rural Development programmes.'"
"I voted against the motion, because overall, it promotes the liberalisation of markets and a trade system which is solely to the detriment of poor and developing countries and shows no real concern for the environmental needs of the planet."
"I consider that the liberalisation of trade and its catastrophic results, which have contributed to the current financial, economic, climate and food crisis, and to job losses, poverty and deindustrialisation, should be rejected."
"I also voted against the motion because it does not safeguard full respect for the rights of governments to protect their ability to regulate and provide fundamental services, especially in the field of public goods and services such as health, education, culture, communications, transport, water and energy."
"Unfortunately, amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected."
"We shall fight for genuine reform of the international trade system orientated towards the introduction of rules for fair trade which comply with international rules in the field of social justice, respect for the environment, food sovereignty and security, sustainable agriculture, viable growth and cultural diversity."
"I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference."
"I did so from a general perspective because it clearly lacks vision in terms of promoting development and respect for developing countries, but more specifically because, while it is vital to successfully conclude the Doha Round, this cannot be done at any price."
"International trade must take account of Europe's longstanding tradition of cooperating with the poorest countries."
"Moreover, on the subject of agriculture and the liberalisation of services, I do not support the approach recommended by this resolution, all the more so since not all of the amendments that were designed to balance the text have been accepted."
"For example, agreeing to step up the negotiations in the services sector (in order to achieve a greater degree of liberalisation) is out of the question."
"Lastly, I regret that the resolution has endorsed the strengthening of bilateral free trade agreements."
"This type of agreement is often far more unfavourable to developing countries."
"Having to face the EU on their own, they have a far weaker negotiating position and tend to be backed into a corner."
"In my view, the Doha Round is fundamentally important for international trade and may greatly help to reduce poverty in developing countries and to share out the benefits of globalisation more fairly."
"It is therefore important that the Doha Development Agenda take account of that effect and make a real contribution to meeting the Millennium Goals."
"It is vital for WTO members to continue to avoid adopting protectionist measures, which could have an extremely onerous impact on the world economy."
"I am convinced that not adopting protectionist measures has led to a better, albeit slow, recovery from the economic crisis we are currently experiencing."
"It is therefore crucial for WTO members to fight protectionism in their bilateral and multilateral relations in future agreements."
"I am in favour of the European Union playing a leading role in the current WTO negotiations, so as to conclude the Doha Round while bearing in mind the new global challenges, such as climate change, security and food sovereignty."
"I hope that the outcome will result in new market opportunities and a strengthening of the rules on multilateral trade, so as to place trade at the service of sustainable development."
"The WTO could manage globalisation better."
"I recognise, however, that in the context of the current economic crisis, the rules and commitments adopted within the WTO have largely prevented its members from turning to restrictive trade measures and have led them to adopt economic recovery measures."
"WTO members must remain committed to actively fighting protectionism."
"I hope greater cooperation will be achieved between the WTO and other international organisations and bodies, such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"This resolution stresses Parliament's neoliberal positions on the Doha Round, which began in 2001, albeit with an occasional reference to social issues and the Millennium Development Goals."
"Its main thrust, however, is the emphasis on total liberalisation of the world market."
"It refuses to accept that it is time to change priorities in international trade and to reject free trade on the grounds of the negative contribution it has made to the financial, economic, food and social crisis that people are now experiencing, with growing unemployment and poverty."
"Free trade only serves the interests of the richest countries and the main economic and financial groups."
"By rejecting our proposed amendments, they said no to a sea change in the negotiations, which would have prioritised development and social advancement, the creation of jobs with rights, and the fight against hunger and poverty."
"It is deplorable that they did not consider it a top priority to abolish tax havens, promote food sovereignty and security, support quality public services and respect governments' right to preserve their economies and public services, particularly in the areas of health, education, water, culture, communications and energy."
"No, global free trade is not a solution to the current crisis."
"On the contrary, it is one of its main causes."
"The Doha Round negotiations have faltered from the start and have been at a standstill for a year because of a fundamental problem, namely, the system has reached its tolerable limits for everyone - be they developed, emerging or least developed, which is the international jargon for those countries that are poverty stricken and forced to integrate into an ultra-competitive global market that swallows them up."
"In Europe, we live according to the paradox perpetuated by the pseudo-elites who govern us and who want us all to be rich and poor at the same time: poor, because we have to be underpaid to compete in the trade war that pits us against countries with low levels of pay, and rich, so that we can consume the cheap and often low-quality imports that are flooding our markets."
"It was some decades ago that a French winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics came up with the obvious solution: free trade is possible and desirable only between countries or entities that have the same level of development."
"That way, it is mutually beneficial to the partners involved."
"For all the rest, trade must be regulated, whether the prophets of ultra-liberalism like it or not."
"I hope that the Doha Development Round will lead to our establishing fair and equitable trade relations."
"That is why I have endorsed the amendments by my political group, which are aimed at improving this resolution in order to strengthen the demands relating to development; to request that public services not be called into question in the negotiations on services; to request, in relation to industrial tariffs, that the need to take account of each country's development level and not to suddenly open these sectors up to competition be recognised; and, lastly, that special and differential treatment for certain types of production in the agricultural sector be preserved."
"The various imbalances in the system of international trade unfairly help to accentuate the asymmetries between the continents."
"In this respect, anything that helps correct the current imbalances is of benefit to everyone and certainly contributes to creating a multilateral system based on fairer and more equitable rules."
"That will give us a fair trading system of service to everyone."
"That is the spirit of the Doha Development Programme."
"After 30 years of free market fundamentalism, the global economy is facing the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s."
"The neoliberal agenda of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), involving deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation of services, has brought further poverty for the majority of the world's population, both in developing and industrialised countries."
"My group has always rejected trade liberalisation and its devastating effects, which are contributing to the current financial, economic, climatic and food crisis."
"For these reasons, I have voted against the Parliament resolution on the WTO ministerial conference and my Group has proposed that a new mandate should be demanded for WTO negotiations."
"Such a mandate must be adapted to the current state of the world."
"It must aim at achieving real reform of the international trade system and ensuring the adoption of fair trade regulations that respect international agreements and national regulations in the areas of social justice, the environment, food sovereignty and sustainable agriculture."
"The joint motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Doha Development Agenda and the WTO continues the trend of global liberalisation in all economic areas."
"There is no doubt that breaking down barriers to trade and increasing trade in some areas brings greater prosperity."
"We have also seen that free trade, in particular, between similarly developed countries, is also beneficial."
"However, if the trading partners are too different in terms of their stage of development, there are, in many cases, negative effects for both parties."
"The complete opening up of the markets of the developing countries to exports from industrialised countries has sometimes resulted in the destruction of the local economic structure, an increased level of poverty for the people and, as a consequence, more people wanting to migrate to Western countries."
"On the other hand, Europe has been inundated with cheap goods from the Far East, the manufacture of which has, in many cases, involved the exploitation of workers."
"Domestic production has been relocated or shut down, which has resulted in unemployment in Europe."
"From this point of view, therefore, certain barriers to trade, for example, to maintain food sovereignty in Europe, make perfect sense."
"It should not be forgotten that the liberalisation of services on the financial markets played a huge part in the current financial and economic crisis."
"Nevertheless, the motion for a resolution speaks in favour of continuing the process of liberalisation and of giving the WTO a greater role as part of a new global order policy and, for this reason, I voted against it."
"I have today voted against the resolution on the Doha Development Agenda because I am opposed to any kind of liberalisation of public services."
"I am thinking in particular of the liberalisation of the water supply, health services and services in the energy sector."
"For the cohesion of society, it is essential that all citizens have access to public services."
"These services must be provided to a high quality, with respect for the principle of universality and, above all, they must be affordable."
"In this regard, the national authorities should have a great deal of discretionary power and broad opportunities to shape their services."
"In this era of globalisation, an effective system for regulating trade is more relevant than ever."
"This is the role of the World Trade Organisation, which was created in 1995 to replace GATT."
"As is emphasised in the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the right of Parliament, which I voted for this lunchtime, the WTO has an essential role to play in ensuring that globalisation is managed better and that its benefits are distributed more evenly."
"Clearly, those who are in favour of protectionism, of turning in on ourselves, are picking the wrong target when they make the WTO the deadly weapon of uncontrolled liberalisation."
"It was the current Director-General of this United Nations body, Pascal Lamy, who indicated the path to follow in 1999: that, conversely, of controlled globalisation."
"In order to follow this path, the European Parliament proposes some practical solutions: completely tax-free and quota-free access to the market for the least developed countries, a successful outcome to the Doha Round for developing countries, demands in terms of environmental and social standards, and a Commission-controlled mandate for agricultural matters."
"In proposing these solutions, we are also pointing out that the European Union must give priority to its political objectives, and not just focus on trade objectives."
"It is with pleasure that I welcome the resolution about the WTO, because it is an exceptionally important problem at the present time."
"The crisis is global in nature, and getting out of it as quickly as possible is in the interests of all of us."
"I think one way of effectively limiting the crisis is to expand world trade."
"Restricting the reform of economies to a regional or national level is easier, but in the long run, it is not a good way to fight the crisis, which is global in extent, and fighting it requires common instruments used on a world scale."
"Therefore, we should do everything to speed up negotiations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation because these negotiations are liberalising trade."
"At the same time, we must adopt sound principles of competitiveness."
"In these principles, product quality standards and conditions of production are especially important, including in the context of fighting climate change and reducing CO2 emissions."
"Highly sensitive goods, such as agricultural and food products, require an exceptionally sound approach."
"In the future, we should think about whether, along with liberalisation of trade in agricultural goods within the framework of the WTO on a world level, we should not also introduce standardisation of some elements of agricultural policy at world level."
"The specific nature of the agricultural sector should be taken into account - its dependence on climatic conditions, questions of quality related to food security, conditions of production and the problem of safeguarding the world's food supply."
"In the WTO negotiations, we need to show greater understanding of others and more goodwill."
"I voted against the motion, because it is predicated entirely on the doctrine and policy of the 'war against terror', which is still being used to justify restrictions on rights and freedoms and to legalise military intervention and actions introduced under the Lisbon Treaty."
"Also, the European Parliament has ultimately been excluded from colegislation, examination and control of measures relating to individual rights and anti-terrorist policies, thereby weakening its role on crucial issues."
"Finally, I would emphasise that, apart from anything else, unfortunately an amendment was passed distorting the role of NGOs, converting them into information providers and a vehicle of the various 'anti-terrorist' security services, instead of helpers in the societies in which they are active."
"Public access to documents is an essential factor in ensuring that there is democratic control of the institutions and that they operate effectively, thus increasing citizens' trust."
"In the framework of the Stockholm Programme, the Council reaffirmed the importance of transparency and invited the Commission to examine the best way to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, document access and good governance, in view of the new opportunities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am in no doubt that the legal basis for the regulation applicable to document access needs changing, as does the legal context in which it should operate, particularly with regard to the relation between the Union's institutions and the citizens."
"Improvements are also needed in substantive terms, as, for example, in something I regard as fundamental, which is Parliament's ability to exercise its right to democratic control through access to sensitive documents."
"Transparency, whether in relation to the public or in interinstitutional terms, is a fundamental principle of the EU."
"The actions and decisions taken by all the EU's institutions, bodies, services and agencies must be guided by the fullest possible compliance with the principle of openness."
"The issue under consideration concerns the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, how to reconcile its Articles 75 and 215 with regard to Parliament's competence in the procedure for adopting restrictive measures against certain persons and entities."
"Whereas Article 215 seems to exclude Parliament from the decision-making process, Article 75 lays down the ordinary legislative procedure and hence this House's participation in defining and adopting measures to prevent terrorism and associated activities."
"Since the rationale behind the restrictive measures provided for in Article 215 is often precisely the fight against terrorism, it is important to determine whether this is an exception to Article 75 and, if so, whether it is acceptable for Parliament to be systematically excluded from the procedure to adopt them."
"I believe it is clear that the legislator intended to entrust adoption of such measures exclusively to the Council. That move may be based on grounds of swiftness and unity in decision making."
"Nonetheless, in any non-urgent situation, I believe there would be an advantage in consulting Parliament when such measures are to be adopted."
"The fight against terrorism is once again being used as an excuse to provide for restrictive measures and sanctions against governments of third states, natural or legal persons, groups or non-state entities."
"That is unacceptable, because the report itself acknowledges that in practice, it is difficult to distinguish between types of threats, even though it makes some attempts to do so."
"We realise that another framework of compliance with international law is needed."
"We do not accept the policy of double standards in relation to governments of third states, natural or legal persons, groups or non-state entities, assessed according to the interests of the United States or the major European powers."
"There is no lack of examples."
"To mention just a few, we have the cases of the illegal occupation of Western Sahara, Aminatou Haidar and other Sahrawis detained in Morocco, and Turkey's actions against the Kurds and against Cyprus."
"We therefore voted against this report, even though we agree with some paragraphs in it, particularly where it asks for clarification from the Commission."
"This Parliament's resolution constantly wavers between the need to take certain measures against terrorist organisations and states that support them, such as freezing their assets or imposing diplomatic and economic sanctions, and so on, and respect for the rights of individuals and organisations to defend themselves against such accusations and sanctions."
"Clearly, this Parliament has chosen to prioritise the rights of suspects over the defence of the nations."
"If, however, democracies cannot, in fact, combat terrorism by denying their own values, then they cannot allow themselves to give the impression of being lax or weak, either."
"I fear that this is exactly the impression that this resolution is giving."
"That is why, the institutional aspects aside, we voted against."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it is important for we MEPs to exercise our parliamentary control over decisions to impose sanctions against persons associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as persons who threaten the rule of law in Zimbabwe and Somalia."
"The chosen legal basis is unacceptable; we ask to be consulted under the ordinary legislative procedure and to be kept informed of developments in the work of the UN Sanctions Committee."
"Lastly, on this matter, I regret the highly administrative approach that the Council is maintaining even though we are talking here about measures relating to individual rights."
"in writing. - The ECR Group are the strongest supporters of measures against terrorists in the EU and especially believe that national governments within the European Union must work together to tackle the constant threat from terrorism."
"The ECR Group have nevertheless decided to abstain on this resolution for two specific reasons: First, we oppose any legislation moving us towards a common European foreign and security policy but secondly, we instead want to see improved and strengthened coordination and cooperation between the EU and national governments, and are very disappointed that this resolution did not sufficiently reflect that."
"The common sense behind the questions that have been asked goes beyond a mere evaluation of doctrine and the consistency between declared intentions and their interpretation."
"There is also a practical consequence, which arises from the old saying that he who can do the greater can certainly do the lesser, and it concerns the following: what sense is there for a body that has competence in criminal matters and in preventing and combating terrorist attacks, through being involved in a codecision process, to be subsequently excluded a priori when other measures are at stake which, by affecting citizens' rights, may even be important in this context as well?"
"It is fundamentally important that the way the Treaty of Lisbon is interpreted in legislation corresponds in reality to the stated strengthening of Parliament's powers and competences."
"At the very least, in some cases, as was raised in the question, it should be possible to have a dual legal basis when the rights of citizens are at stake and anti-terrorism policies are threatened."
"In other cases, such as Zimbabwe and Somalia, optional consultation should be envisaged, as in fact is enshrined in the Stuttgart Declaration on the European Union, which was also mentioned in the question."
"In recent years, more and more liberties have been curtailed in the name of combating terror."
"With the SWIFT Agreement and the Stockholm Programme, in particular, the 'transparent person' is becoming ever more a reality."
"Of course, in a time of modern technology, globalisation and a borderless EU, it is important for the authorities to work together and also to prepare themselves accordingly."
"However, the state must not sink to the level of the terrorists."
"We only have to think of the questionable role of the EU and individual Member States in connection with CIA overflights and secret US prisons."
"The monitoring of legality is an important counterweight to ensure that an accused is afforded the minimum rights according to the requirements of a modern democracy."
"The report in question is not clear enough in terms of its approach and also says too little about past failures and data protection issues. I have therefore abstained from the vote."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Award of the Sakharov Prize (formal sitting)"
"Dear honoured guests, dear colleagues, dear friends, there are days when I am particularly proud to sit in the chair of the European Parliament as President."
"Today is such a day."
"Today we are honouring the winners of the 2009 Sakharov Prize, the prize for freedom of thought."
"It is an enormous honour to recall that the Conference of Presidents decided to award the prize to Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, on behalf of Memorial and all other human rights defenders in Russia."
"I am proud that this decision was taken unanimously."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"With this prize we, Members of the European Parliament, honour those still among us who fight for human rights, but we also honour those who lost their lives in this very struggle."
"Natalia Estemirova should have been among us today, as should Anna Politkovskaya."
"Their killers have yet to be brought to justice."
"(Applause)"
"We in Europe know what the price of freedom is; what the price of freedom of thought is."
"On 16 December, exactly 28 years ago, strikers were killed in the Wujek coal mine by the Polish communist police because they fought for solidarity; that is, for basic human rights, for dignity."
"Twenty years ago, on 16 December in Romania, a revolution started which claimed the lives of over 1 000 people because they fought for their freedom."
"This happened in countries which are now members of the European Union; countries which today are together with us."
"We in the European Parliament will never forget the past."
"It is our duty to safeguard those values which are so dear to all of us."
"In Europe, we enjoy our daily human right of freedom of thought because of their highest sacrifice."
"on behalf of Memorial, winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize. - (translated from the original Russian) Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Memorial organisation, let me thank the European Parliament for this high accolade - the Sakharov Prize."
"Memorial views this award as being not only for our organisation: the prize is being awarded to the entire human rights community in Russia and, more broadly, to an appreciable section of Russian society."
"For 40 years now, first in the Soviet Union and then in Russia, human rights defenders have been standing up for 'European' - that is to say, universal - values."
"This struggle has always been tragic and has, in recent years, claimed the lives of the best and the most fearless."
"I am sure that, in awarding the Sakharov Prize to Memorial, the European Parliament had them in mind, first and foremost - our dead friends and comrades-in-arms."
"This prize belongs by right to them."
"And the first name I should cite is that of Natalya Estemirova, a fellow member of Memorial, murdered this summer in Chechnya."
"I cannot go on without mentioning other names, too: the lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, and journalists, Anna Politkovskaya and Anastasia Baburova, murdered in Moscow; ethnologist, Nikolai Girenko, shot in St Petersburg;"
"I would ask you to rise to honour the memory of these people."
"(The House rose and observed a moment's silence)"
"These people died so that Russia could become a genuinely European country, where public and political life is based on the primacy of the life and freedom of each single individual."
"That means they also died for Europe, since a Europe without Russia is incomplete."
"I hope everyone understands that, when I speak of 'European values' and 'European political culture', I do not ascribe to such terms any geographical content or any 'Eurocentrism', because a political culture based on freedom and the rights of the individual embodies a universal system of values that is equally fitting for Europe and for Africa, for Russia and for China."
"Today's event is symbolic and interconnected: the award itself, the day on which it is being presented, those making the award and those receiving it."
"Andrei Sakharov, who died 20 years ago, was a distinguished champion of human rights as well as a distinguished thinker."
"He advanced two major propositions."
"The first was that only by overcoming political disunity and enmity does humanity have the chance to survive and develop, and the opportunity to cope with the global challenges of the age and to secure world peace and progress on our planet."
"The second proposition was that the only reliable support for our efforts to overcome the political disunity of the modern world is human rights and, first and foremost, intellectual freedom."
"The European Union, whose Parliament instituted this prize while Sakharov was still alive, is, perhaps, today the closest model to that future united humanity dreamt of by Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov."
"In recent times, Russia and Europe have been increasingly set in opposition to one another."
"In Russia, it has become fashionable to talk about 'Russia's special path', about 'Russia's special spirituality' and even about 'special national values'."
"And in the Euro-Atlantic world, one often hears opinions of Russia as an 'odd man out' among countries, one whose political development is determined by its history and specific characteristics, and similar speculative constructs."
"What is there to say in this regard?"
"Russia, just like any other country, has its own path towards ordering life on the basis of universal human foundations."
"No nation in the world organises its life according to ideas and designs entirely borrowed from outside, but Russia's connection with Europe is far from being determined only by who borrows and from whom."
"The question can be put another way: has Russia brought something to the pan-European and universal civilisation taking shape before our eyes?"
"And here I would like to recall Russia's unique contribution to the spiritual and political progress of Europe and humanity: the key role played by the Soviet human rights movement in forming modern political culture."
"Sakharov rethought the role of human rights and intellectual freedom in the modern world as far back as 1968."
"His ideas were transferred to the practical level by the human rights organisations created by Soviet dissidents - first and foremost, the Moscow Helsinki Group, represented here today by Lyudmila Alexeyeva."
"These organisations were the first to declare publicly that fine-sounding declarations about international protection of human rights could not just remain declarations."
"We succeeded in mobilising world public opinion and the Western political elite was forced to move away from its traditional pragmatism."
"Naturally, this development also gave rise to a multitude of new problems that are still not fully resolved - an example being the doctrine of humanitarian intervention."
"Nevertheless, over the last 30 years a considerable amount has been achieved, although much more still lies ahead to be done."
"Russian human rights defenders of the 1970s were at the origins of this process and, if only for that reason, Russia cannot be struck from the list of European countries."
"In Russia, in the last third of the 20th century, as nowhere else, the human rights movement became synonymous with citizenship and Russian human rights thinking was able to develop as far as Sakharov's global generalisations and take on the quality of a new political philosophy."
"This is linked to the unique nature of Russia's tragic history in the 20th century, to the need to comprehend and overcome the bloody and dirty past."
"If the Second World War was the impetus for the post-war political modernisation of Western Europe, having become the logical conclusion of the relatively short period of domination by the Nazi regime in Germany, then for the USSR and Russia, the need for reconstruction was dictated by the experience of 70 years of domination by the Communist regime, the culmination of which was Stalin's terrorist dictatorship."
"The two key components of resurgent Russian citizenship were legal consciousness and historical memory."
"The human rights movement positioned itself, from the outset, first and foremost as a movement for overcoming Stalinism in the public, political and cultural life of the country."
"In one of this movement's first public texts - a leaflet distributed by the organisers of the historic meeting of 5 December 1965 in defence of the law - it was said in this regard, with the utmost simplicity and brevity: 'The bloody past calls us to vigilance in the present'."
"In essence, this special connection between two components of civil consciousness - legal thinking and historical memory - is inherited in its entirety by Russia's modern human rights community, and perhaps also by Russian civil society as a whole."
"I believe that the paramount importance that Sakharov attached to Memorial in the final years and months of his life is linked to the fact that he understood clearly this specific aspect."
"In the activity of Memorial, these two basic components of Russian public awareness have merged into one whole."
"It is my view that now also, on the 20th anniversary of Sakharov's death, the Members of the European Parliament, in choosing the recipient of the Prize, also felt and understood this specific aspect."
"We all remember the resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism, adopted by the European Parliament in April."
"This resolution, like the OSCE resolution that followed in July, on divided Europe reunited, demonstrates that a united Europe understands the sense and thrust of our work."
"Memorial thanks you for this understanding."
"The absurdity of the present-day political situation in Russia is illustrated clearly by the fact that our own Parliament - the Parliament of the country that suffered most and longest of all from Stalinism and Communist dictatorship - instead of warmly supporting these resolutions, immediately declared them 'anti-Russian'!"
"This shows that, even today, Stalinism is not, for Russia, simply a historical episode of the 20th century."
"We let slip a few years of confused and incomplete political freedom."
"The main feature of Communist totalitarianism - the attitude to people as an expendable resource - was not eliminated."
"The aims of state policy are determined, as before, regardless of the opinion and interests of the country's citizens."
"The establishment of a regime of 'imitation democracy' in today's Russia is connected precisely with this."
"All of the institutions of modern democracy are resolutely imitated: a multi-party system, parliamentary elections, separation of powers, an independent judicial system, independent television broadcasting, and so on."
"Today, mass terror is not needed for imitation: there are enough stereotypes of public consciousness and behaviour preserved from the Stalinist era."
"On the other hand, terror is also used when necessary."
"Over the last 10 years, more than 3 000 people in the Chechen Republic have 'disappeared' - that is to say, been abducted, tortured, summarily executed and buried no one knows where."
"At first, these crimes were perpetrated by representatives of the federal authorities, but they then handed this 'work', so to speak, over to local security structures."
"How many Russian security officials are punished for these crimes?"
"A mere handful."
"Who ensured they were called to account and judged?"
"First and foremost, the human rights defender, Natalya Estemirova, the journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, the lawyer, Stanislav Markelov."
"Where are they all?"
"Murdered."
"We see that the violence routinely taking place in Chechnya is extending beyond its borders and threatening to spread to the whole country."
"Yet we see that, even in such circumstances, people are found who are prepared to oppose a return to the past."
"And this is a basis for hope."
"We all understand that nobody can return Russia to the path of freedom and democracy but Russia itself, its people and its civil society."
"What is more, the situation in our country is not as straightforward as it might appear to the superficial observer."
"We have many allies in society - both in the struggle for human rights and in the struggle with Stalinism."
"What can we expect here from European politicians and from European public opinion?"
"Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov formulated these expectations more than 20 years ago: 'My country needs support and pressure'."
"A united Europe has opportunities for such a firm and, at the same time, friendly policy based on support and pressure, but is far from making full use of them."
"I would like to mention just two examples."
"The first is the work of the European Court of Human Rights with respect to complaints by Russian citizens."
"The very possibility that victims may appeal to Strasbourg compels Russian courts to work in a qualitative and independent way."
"The main thing is that enforcement of the judgments of the European Court should remove the causes leading to violation of human rights."
"In recent years, more than 100 judgments have been delivered in Strasbourg in 'Chechen' cases, concerning serious crimes by representatives of the state against citizens."
"Yet what happens?"
"Nothing."
"Russia duly pays the victims the compensation ordered by the European Court, as some sort of 'impunity tax', refusing to investigate the crimes and punish those guilty."
"Moreover, not only are all the generals mentioned by name in the Strasbourg judgments not brought before the courts, but they are put forward for promotion."
"So what if the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is called upon to monitor enforcement of the Court's judgments?"
"In Strasbourg they shrug: 'What can we do?' - and remain silent."
"The second, more general, example concerns relations between Russia and the European Union in the area of human rights."
"Today they virtually boil down to the fact that the European Union holds consultations with Russia on this subject once every six months."
"How is this opportunity used?"
"Officials, not of the highest rank, talk for a few hours behind closed doors - Europe asks about Chechnya, Russia answers with a question about Estonia or Latvia, and they go their separate ways for another six months."
"Both Russian and international non-governmental organisations hold fringe events and hearings, and present reports."
"In meetings with human rights defenders, the representatives of Brussels sigh sadly: 'What can we do?' - and remain silent."
"So what should Europe do in relation to Russia?"
"From our point of view, the answer is simple: it should act towards Russia just as it does towards any other European country that has taken on certain obligations and has a responsibility to meet them."
"Alas, today, Europe increasingly rarely formulates its recommendations to Russia in the area of democracy and human rights, sometimes even preferring not to mention them at all."
"It is not important why this is the case - whether it is a sense of the futility of efforts or pragmatic considerations linked to oil and gas."
"It is Europe's duty not to remain silent but, again and again, to repeat and remind, and insist respectfully and firmly that Russia meet its obligations."
"(Applause)"
"Of course, not only are there no guarantees, but there are also no particular hopes that these calls will achieve their objectives."
"However, failure to remind will certainly be understood by the Russian authorities as indulgence."
"Taking sensitive issues off the agenda unequivocally harms Russia, but it also harms Europe just as much, since it places in doubt the commitment of the European institutions to European values."
"The prize you are awarding today is awarded 'For Freedom of Thought'."
"One would think, how can thought not be free, who can limit its freedom and how?"
"There is a means - it is the fear that becomes part of a person's personality and makes that person think and even feel as required."
"People are not only afraid; they find an outlet in 'loving Big Brother', as described by George Orwell."
"So it was when Russia had Stalin, and so it was when Germany had Hitler."
"This is now being repeated in Chechnya, under Ramzan Kadyrov."
"Such fear can spread throughout Russia."
"Yet what can stand up to fear?"
"However paradoxical it may be, purely and solely freedom of thought."
"This quality, possessed by Sakharov to an unusual degree, made him impervious to fear."
"And watching him also freed others from fear."
"Freedom of thought is the basis of all other freedoms."
"That is why it is so appropriate for the Sakharov Prize to be awarded 'For Freedom of Thought'."
"We are proud to receive it today."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.30 and resumed at 15.00)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"New EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Madam President, the problems facing Afghanistan and Pakistan are naturally a concern of the whole world."
"Violent extremism is spreading beyond the region."
"Drugs that are grown and produced in Afghanistan find their way onto the streets of Europe."
"One of the driving forces behind our commitment is the need to prevent Afghanistan and Pakistan becoming safe havens for terrorist activity and organised crime."
"At the same time, of course, we want to help create better countries for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan to live in."
"A lot of attention is focused on Afghanistan."
"Many of our countries have troops and significant numbers of civil personnel in the country."
"Turning around the situation in Afghanistan represents a major challenge."
"Pakistan, too, faces serious challenges."
"There will be no solution to the conflict in Afghanistan if we do not also get to grips with the situation in Pakistan, and vice versa."
"An overall initiative is required."
"We all need to do more and to do better."
"In June, the Council asked the Council Secretariat and the Commission to put forward specific recommendations and political priorities to strengthen and enhance our commitment in the region."
"The result was the EU action plan for strengthening the EU's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"This was adopted in October."
"I believe that this action plan is a good tool."
"The basic strategy is already in place."
"The action plan will allow us to adapt the instruments currently being used to meet our political priorities."
"The plan is based on our current commitment and lays down a number of priorities."
"These are the areas in which we believe EU measures can be most effective."
"In so doing, we are strengthening our commitment and presenting a united response to the challenges faced by Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"It also sends out a message to the region that we are prepared to stay the course."
"The regional perspective is important, which is why the action plan places great emphasis on regional cooperation in particular."
"Afghanistan is entering a decisive period."
"There is no need to discuss the election process further."
"That is behind us."
"It left much to be desired and we hope that it will not be repeated."
"I believe that is also the opinion of the Afghan people."
"The EU is prepared to support the work that remains to be done, based - among other things - on the recommendations made by the EU's election observers."
"We hope that a new government will soon be in place."
"This represents an opportunity to agree on a new agenda and a new concord between the Afghan Government and the international community."
"President Karzai made a welcome promise of a new start in his inaugural address."
"We hope that the conference to be held in London shortly will create some momentum."
"The EU expects a strong commitment and leadership from President Karzai and his government."
"Five years with no change is not an option."
"The focus must now be on ensuring that the Afghan state gradually takes on more responsibility, with the international community adopting a supporting role."
"By this I do not mean withdrawal."
"Next year, there will be significantly greater numbers of international personnel in Afghanistan."
"The US is sending an additional 30 000 personnel to supplement the 68 000 already in the country."
"Other NATO countries and allies have promised an extra 7 000 personnel at least, in addition to the 38 000 already there."
"This military commitment must be matched by civil initiatives."
"There can be no lasting military withdrawal from Afghanistan unless a civil framework for stability is in place."
"Effective state institutions, better forms of government, access to basic welfare, the rule of law and a functioning civil state are at least as important as hard security."
"Nobody would question this."
"Security, good governance and development must go hand in hand."
"We are making a long-term commitment to Afghanistan."
"However, the Afghan people must ensure that it is their own government, not international organisations, that bring about an improvement in living standards."
"That is the only way for the population to regain trust in their leaders."
"The international community is there."
"We will need to do more and to do better."
"We need to support the process that is under way - the Afghanisation process that is so essential for the country."
"That is the core of our action plan."
"We are strengthening efforts by the EU to improve Afghan capabilities and we are cooperating with the government to promote effective state institutions that can be held responsible, at both local and regional level."
"We place great importance on the principle of the rule of law, good governance, the fight against corruption and on improving the human rights situation."
"Agriculture and rural development are a further priority area for Europe."
"It is very important that the standard of living is increased for the great majority of Afghans who live in rural areas."
"We are also prepared to support an Afghan-led rehabilitation process for former militants."
"Those who have taken part in conflict in the past must be offered alternatives."
"Support for the electoral system will naturally also be high on the agenda."
"I would also like to say a few words about Pakistan."
"Pakistan is a country that has been through major changes in recent years."
"The 2008 elections re-established democracy and civilian rule."
"The transition to democracy has been impressive."
"However, democracy is currently in a fragile and unstable state."
"At the same time, the Pakistani Taliban has become a real threat to peace and stability in the country."
"Scarcely a week passes without media reports of further suicide attacks."
"In the past week, more than 400 people have been killed in attacks carried out by militant groups."
"The EU wants to help support Pakistan's civil institutions."
"It is particularly important to follow up the recommendations made by Michael Gahler, our 2008 election observer."
"These provide a basic framework for future democracy, electoral reform and institution building."
"The Pakistani Government knows that this must be done."
"It must indicate to us the areas in which it wishes to cooperate."
"The EU will develop the strategic partnership with Pakistan that resulted from the successful special summit in June 2009."
"We want to strengthen democracy and achieve stability."
"That is why we are working on the civil state, the fight against terrorism and trade."
"Naturally, a functioning government that accepts responsibility for its people and demonstrates the leadership required to take the country forward is a central element of this."
"In partnership with the government of Pakistan, the EU will support the strengthening of the country's democratic institutions and structures."
"This will also be brought about through economic development and trade."
"We welcome the fact that Pakistan is taking greater responsibility for its own security."
"We expect the country to take the same approach in respect of all forms of terrorism, including militants that use Pakistani territory to launch attacks inside Afghanistan."
"The government's efforts against the Pakistani Taliban represent a positive move."
"At the same time, civilians must be protected and international law complied with."
"The government should also be attentive to the need for humanitarian aid and reconstruction in the areas affected."
"We need to take further steps in our operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"The EU is already making a substantial commitment to the challenges of the region and this will continue."
"Much has been achieved in both countries - both by the efforts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and by the international community."
"Strategies and documents will not in themselves improve the situation."
"It is now time to put them into action, together with our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Let me start with Afghanistan."
"We are at an important point in our relations here."
"Our future support must help build a government that is responsive to the needs and the concerns of the Afghan people."
"As the situation is volatile, we need to both work with, and to influence, the situation on the ground."
"That is what the international conferences, which begin with a conference in London next month, are all about."
"We are ready to put in more resources."
"The Commission is raising its development assistance by one third to EUR 200 million."
"We need these extra resources to repeat the successes, like the extension of the primary health care system to 80% of Afghans - including far better treatment for women and girls - and recent success in turning provinces poppy free."
"Our Member States have also committed to help get our police training programme up to strength."
"But that is all just the start."
"We need to deliver this as part of a coherent EU contribution within a coordinated international response."
"This response must have the Afghans working with the UN at the centre of it."
"The action plan agreed by the Council in October gives us the opportunity to do this."
"Together with the US efforts and NATO security operations, it sends a strong message to the region and international community about our commitment."
"It also, of course, dovetails the priorities set out by President Karzai, particularly in the fields of improved governance and anti-corruption."
"The plan confirms that we will continue to place key sectors such as the rule of law and agriculture at the centre of our engagement."
"We are already assisting the government to improve the skills of administrators in Kabul."
"We will now start to roll these skills out across the provinces to help the Afghan people manage their own affairs and ensure the government provides - and is seen to provide - services to them."
"The plan sends a message that we will support the integration of insurgents who are ready to respond to President Karzai's call to work with his government."
"The European Electoral Observation Mission also presents its report in Kabul today and I would like to pay tribute to Mr Berman and his team for a job well done in extremely difficult circumstances."
"We will ensure follow up, since it is clear the credibility of the government and the political system rests upon a major overhaul of the electoral system."
"Finally on Afghanistan, but perhaps most importantly, we are streamlining our structures on the ground."
"Member States will align policies with the resources to back them, and I hope to merge the EU Special Representative and the Head of the EU Delegation into a single post as soon as possible."
"That will help us to build a coherent approach that can serve as a model for elsewhere."
"Turning to Pakistan, our overriding concern and interest is that Pakistan should be a stable democracy free from terror and able to join with its neighbours in defence against common threats."
"The action plan underlines this and builds on existing commitments made at the June EU-Pakistan Summit, including humanitarian aid, reconstruction support, assistance to the police and judiciary and strengthening democratic institutions and civil society to improve human rights, as well as agreements on trade and socio-economic development."
"We will continue to support the implementation of the recommendations of the 2008 election observation mission."
"The action plan is backed up by a substantial financial resource of just under EUR 500 million from the Commission until 2013, plus a EUR 100 million renewable energy loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as commitments to deepen our trade and political relations."
"The action plan also specifies intensified dialogue on all these issues and there should be a second summit next year within the Spanish Presidency."
"The action plan also makes clear that the European Union will use its expertise in regional integration to help Afghanistan, Pakistan and their neighbours to kick-start economic relations, particularly with India."
"There will be no overnight solution to current tensions but we must make a start to overcoming distrust."
"The potential gains from this kind of regional cooperation in terms of trade and investment would dwarf anything we can do as the European Union."
"In conclusion, implementation of the plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan is central to our future engagement in these countries."
"It is a joint endeavour between Member States and the EU institutions and it is the first of its kind, which, if successful, can help shape the international civilian response to crises that have so far largely been defined in military terms."
"The action plan amounts to a major commitment not only to Afghanistan and Pakistan, but to south and central Asia as a whole."
"But we need more than ideas to deliver: we need the right people and the right skills, and they need security in order to work."
"There must be stronger political engagement by the host governments, and stronger coherence among donors, including internally among Member States."
"South Asia faces extremism every day, whether on the battlefield in Helmand or on the streets of Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi."
"We will not tackle this through military action alone but by helping build a secure and safe environment free from the tensions and inequalities that feed extremism."
"Europe has much to offer from our own experience."
"The action plan provides us with the opportunity to use this experience to help others, and I hope Parliament will support it."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the goal in Afghanistan was to fight the Taliban, who offered a safe haven to al-Qaeda."
"Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven but the Taliban insurgency has not been defeated because it was proven that victory cannot be achieved by military means alone and that over-reliance on military power by killing insurgents was counterproductive."
"The shift in strategy is for the protection of the population, building the Afghan security capacity, facilitating good governance at central, and particularly local, level, and promoting development."
"In this context, encouragement is needed for an Afghan-led reconciliation process for those layers of Taliban who got on the wrong side due to special circumstances."
"The EU Action Plan addresses all these challenges, and the EU can play an important role in non-military areas."
"However, I would have expected much more emphasis on the issue of narcotics - you mentioned it, Minister - and tougher words of warning on corruption and bad governance."
"As for Pakistan: 'yes' to the action plan."
"Both cases are interconnected, and success on either depends on success on both."
"Pakistan should be in a position to adequately fight the influx of insurgents from Afghanistan."
"Finally, diplomacy is needed to avoid the eternal mistrust between India and Pakistan becoming an impediment to overall success."
"Madam President, Minister, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, with this debate, the European Parliament is seeking to contribute to the discussion on the role of Europe within a region that is crucial to the safety and stability of the entire planet."
"The new military strategy announced by President Obama, and even more clearly set out in the subsequent statement made by the foreign ministers of ISAF countries, has linked the sending of new troops to the primary aim of protecting the population and strengthening the capabilities of the security forces and the Afghan institutions."
"This welcome sea change takes into account the pointlessness, I would even go so far as to say the counterproductiveness, of a conventional type of military effort, focusing entirely on repressing Taliban guerrilla action."
"However, in order to ensure that this new course is productive and sparks a transition towards a safe, prosperous, stable and therefore self-sufficient Afghanistan, it is very clear that the military dimension of the intervention by the international community must be accompanied by growing commitment on the civil and political front."
"On the one hand, we must promote economic development and strengthen the institutions, governance and the rule of law and, on the other, we must facilitate the process of internal reconciliation and help to stabilise the situation in Pakistan."
"This is where the European Union's place and role lies."
"Europe has been considerably committed in the region for some time: EUR 1 billion per year in Afghanistan, EUR 300 million in Pakistan, the EUPOL mission, which is doing an invaluable job despite its staffing problems, the international observation mission and also, naturally, the commitment of individual States to the ISAF mission."
"Europe's ability to make a substantial difference in the region nevertheless seems to be decidedly low considering the amount of human and financial resources committed."
"For this reason, we need to strengthen our undertaking, in other words, Europe's leadership, and make it more consistent and effective from the viewpoint of civil strategy and political undertaking."
"From this point of view, the action plan constitutes an important step forward, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports it and demands its firm implementation."
"At the same time, we wonder whether the objectives stated in the plan also require the identification of ad hoc measures and call for thought to be given to extending the aims and reinforcing the tools of the ESDP EUPOL mission."
"The European Parliament is ready to offer its support to the action of the European Union on all these fronts."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we are here to deal with the EU plan of action for Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Parliament has given me the opportunity to be the rapporteur on a new strategy for Afghanistan."
"We need a new strategy - or maybe we just need any strategy at all - on the civilian side because, until now, the EU intervention in that country has not had enough coherence and seems to have had a very limited impact."
"I am afraid, Mrs Ashton, that I cannot share your initial statement on Afghanistan because it is too generic, too bureaucratic, too unfocused - like the current action plan."
"I believe Parliament must contribute to making this strategy stronger and more coherent."
"I am putting together all the necessary bits of information."
"First of all, I have to say that it is turning out to be very difficult to get even the most basic data on how much was spent by the EU in Afghanistan after the 2001 occupation, where the EU aid arrived and how much of it can be accounted for."
"We know that almost EUR 1 billion is spent every year there, which is a big sum."
"The Afghan GDP is just EUR 6.9 billion."
"Our civilian aid therefore amounts to more than 20 percent of the yearly Afghan GDP, a figure that has the potential to reverse the destiny of the country if properly used."
"Secondly, my attempt to draw a new strategy for Afghanistan will start with an effort to identify what has been, and what should be, the EU interest in the area."
"I will focus part of my report on the elimination of the opium poppy through the alternative development strategy."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I think there are certain things to be welcomed in the action plan but, as colleagues have correctly pointed out, there are a number of questions there that have not been answered."
"I think that, when we are looking at this, we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths, the targeted killings of the Hazara population, for example, in parts of Pakistan, the attacks on girls' schools, on the police and so many others."
"The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban."
"I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in."
"In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India."
"The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region."
"We also need, in Pakistan particularly, to be looking at what effective support we are offering in terms of the many thousands of displaced people, and learn from our lack of engagement with those who were displaced to the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past that a vacuum will be filled."
"Therefore, we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, we cannot afford to let the NATO-ISAF military mission in Afghanistan fail."
"With sufficient political will, the right military equipment and more troop numbers on the ground from all the Member States, NATO can defeat the Taliban and, of course, this must be coupled to a hearts-and-minds campaign as well."
"But next door, Pakistan is potentially a catastrophe in the making - a nuclear arms state plagued by Islamist radicalisation, corruption and feeble leadership, which, nevertheless, we have to help for strategic reasons."
"But, for instance, elements of the Pakistani ISA have long been suspected of granting tacit support to the Afghan Taliban and are only now reluctantly realising the domestic dangers of such an approach."
"The threat posed by Pakistan, particularly by harbouring terrorists, to India over Kashmir also poses a grave threat to the whole region."
"If Pakistan is to continue to receive military aid from EU countries for counter-insurgency operations against terrorist jihadis, and also EU economic assistance, it must give cast-iron guarantees that such aid will not be diverted to strengthening its conventional forces on the Indian border."
"Finally, the instability of Pakistan and Afghanistan contrasts greatly with the stability and moderation of our democratic ally and partner, India, which deserves the EU's full backing."
"Madam President, Madam Vice-President designate, my group has never supported the strategy of the previous President of the United States, Mr Bush, in relation to Afghanistan."
"We never supported it and time has proved us right."
"Afghanistan currently has a corrupt, illegitimate government, there are innocent victims and the situation of women has not changed at all."
"It would therefore have been logical to change strategies, and we regret that President Obama has opted for a military solution, and intends to deploy an additional 30 000 troops."
"I believe that the European Union should not follow this line of action, because there is a real risk of creating a new Vietnam in the 21st century in Afghanistan."
"In Afghanistan, history has demonstrated that there can be no military solution."
"Cooperation must be increased and all efforts to find a diplomatic solution must be intensified."
"In the conflict zone itself and in geostrategic terms, we must opt for respect for international law through internal solutions in Afghanistan."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I had the pleasure a few weeks ago of meeting some of the UK returning forces from Afghanistan and I heard the same story over and over again that they were ill-equipped."
"Yet the UK pays GBP 45 million a day into this corrupt institution."
"Some of that money could be better spent in arming our forces in Afghanistan, forces that actually train the Afghan police force, etc."
"It is quite right, as some of you have said; this is an important area in the world and an important area that we may need to make progress in."
"My problem is with the lack of experience of our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Cathy pass-the-bucket Ashton, with more than a few roubles in it, no doubt. We need someone more experienced."
"She has not had any Foreign Office experience; she has not been a foreign secretary and I do not think she even had a part-time job in a travel agents'."
"Come on!"
"This is a delicate job; a job that needs to change things for the better and she is simply not experienced enough."
"Madam President, at first sight, the Council's conclusions about Afghanistan appear to be a welcome contrast to the belligerent attitude of the United States and the United Kingdom."
"When looked at more closely, it is actually a mixture of naivety and complicity in their methods."
"The Council is thoroughly naive in trying to plant the delicate flower of Western democracy in the inhospitable soil of Afghan tribalism."
"The vertical divisions in society and the domination of tribal loyalties over personal judgment would make that impossible."
"It wants to remove corruption but simply does not understand that the bureaucratic model of objective judgment and financial and resource decisions would not stand a chance of being respected."
"This is not because Afghans are endemically dishonest but because Afghan tribal society sees looking after one's own family and tribe as a self-evident virtue."
"The Council would like to counter the production of opium poppies."
"However, removing the Taliban from government was not the best way of reducing that production."
"The Taliban government reduced it by 90% but, since the invasion of Afghanistan, Afghanistan is again the world's leading opium producer."
"The report says 'Insecurity in Afghanistan cannot be addressed by military means alone'."
"That can only mean that military action has a legitimate part to play."
"In my view, it does not."
"We have had three failed wars against Afghanistan in the 19th and early 20th centuries; we really ought to have learnt our lesson."
"The Taliban oppresses women, has contempt for democracy and is killing British soldiers: it is a thoroughly unpleasant organisation."
"But we could stop it from killing British and allied soldiers tomorrow by removing our troops."
"It is a murderous, pointless war that simply cannot be won."
"(ES) Madam President, the international community, and not just the United States, has a problem in Afghanistan."
"President Obama has taken three months to establish a global strategy in response to General McChrystal's alarming report."
"It is well known that that new strategy involves short-term reinforcement of military presence, withdrawal in 2011, progressive transferral of aspects of security to the Afghan forces, better coordination between civilian and military efforts and concentration on large cities."
"Now, Mrs Ashton, the great challenge is to articulate and identify a European response, mainly at the London Conference."
"In your statement, you referred to two key words."
"You said that our response must be coordinated with other international bodies and we support coordination with the United Nations."
"You also said that our response must be coherent."
"I have two comments in this respect, Mrs Ashton."
"In 2005, I had the privilege to lead a Parliament electoral observation mission and I had the opportunity to meet the head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Lieutenant-General Graziano, whose tour of duty in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is coming to an end."
"The 44 countries in ISAF today (28 of them NATO countries) constitute a heterogeneous force that is not providing an effective response in the current fight against insurgents."
"The second vital aspect, Mrs Ashton, is that a war cannot be won - and there is currently a war in progress in Afghanistan - without having the civilian population on our side, on the side of the international coalition."
"I believe, Mrs Ashton, that one of the European Union's main objectives should be to concentrate our efforts, which involve EUR 1 billion of the European Union's money, on ensuring that the civilian population is on our side."
"Madam President, let me start today by remembering Lance Corporal Adam Drane, 23, of the Royal Anglian Regiment, from Bury St Edmunds in my constituency, who died in Helmand province on 7 December, the 100th member of the British armed forces to be killed this year."
"Our thoughts should be with Adam's family and all those families, European, Afghan and Pakistani, who have suffered such loss."
"In the face of such sacrifice, we in this House have our own duty to ensure that we do all we can to promote peace and prosperity for Afghanistan."
"If we are to take seriously the new Lisbon changes and a proper common EU foreign policy, there is no more urgent place to prove ourselves than in the sands of Afghanistan, first to ensure proper alignment of individual Member States' activities behind this new strategy and, second, to welcome High Representative Ashton's commitment today to have a formidable new double-hatted representative in place in Afghanistan very early in the New Year."
"This is both a litmus test of more efficient EU working under the treaty and a marker of our future resolve for Afghanistan."
"Finally, allied to this, Member States must ensure that EUPOL recruits the 400 officers promised; this is absolutely necessary to ensure Afghanistan's own law-enforcement services can do their job properly."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to make it clear straight away that I totally disapprove of the remarks that Mrs Sinclaire has just made against Mrs Ashton."
"Madam President, one in four children does not reach the age of five in Afghanistan, a country marked by social and health deficits, to which democratic and, above all, security deficits can be added."
"The likelihood of a confrontation with Pakistan provides an incentive for the Taliban to mobilise and highlights the need to address Afghanistan's problems from a regional perspective."
"We should add to that the fact that the inability to overcome the situation by military means alone predestines the European Union, with its extensive range of tools, to play a special role."
"NATO, which is primarily responsible for the military aspect, is reaching its limits in the face of the Afghan challenge."
"The European Union's humanitarian action, its cooperation and development instruments and its more highly effective diplomacy are certainly not a guarantee of success, but deprived of this support, NATO's action is doomed to failure."
"A new combination of all these elements will - it must be hoped - result in a more promising outlook for Afghan citizens."
"Although the European Union's responsibility in the current situation is great, that of Afghanistan, which is still too corrupt, divided and disorganised, is overwhelming."
"Let us not forget that the partnership offered to Afghanistan can only succeed if a sufficient number of citizens support the reconstruction of their country."
"Although this is a huge task, it is not a reason to sit back and leave countries prey to all manner of fundamentalists."
"(FR) Madam President, yes, we will have to emerge from the Afghan trap into which we fell because of the policy pursued by George Bush."
"However, the question is not when, but how, we pull out of Afghanistan."
"If the countless mistakes made by the international community are not called into question, we are in danger of completely losing the confidence and support of the Afghan population, for the benefit of the Taliban."
"The militarisation of humanitarian aid and development aid must stop because it is creating confusion in people's minds and discrediting the NGOs."
"We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists."
"Why is Europe in Afghanistan?"
"Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence?"
"We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services - education, health and transport - and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state."
"Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population."
"Madam President, to read the EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, you would imagine that the whole situation depended on what the EU does."
"I believe the European Union could make a useful, practical contribution, but this needs to be set in the context of the wider, international effort and it should be focused on some specific activities where EU involvement might add real value."
"It is too serious for EU posturing."
"In a document of over a dozen pages, I found only four brief references to the United States and, more significantly perhaps, only one to NATO, and it is after all the NATO ISAF mission which is central to the success of all endeavours."
"Without security and stability, it is not possible to ensure good governance or any meaningful programme of reconstruction and development."
"On the civil side, European countries and the EU itself have pumped EUR 8 billion into Afghanistan since 2001, but this huge sum seems to have made little difference; do we have any idea how much of it has gone astray?"
"There needs to be a comprehensive international plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, but I have yet to see where the EU contribution fits into this wider, international commitment."
"(DE) Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed."
"The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan."
"Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy."
"We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy."
"Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education."
"The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here."
"This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters."
"However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances."
"Time is running out!"
"(FR) Madam President, I believe that we must try to come up with some simple ideas with regard to these very complicated matters."
"My first question is simple: Why did we go to Afghanistan?"
"We went to Afghanistan with one objective: to dismantle the al-Qaeda training camps, the support base of international terrorism, which were threatening us and threatening stability in the region."
"Today, those camps no longer exist."
"My second observation is that, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, troops from the West deployed in Afghanistan are increasingly being regarded as occupation forces and no longer as friendly forces."
"This is a major, everyday problem that we must bear in mind."
"I invite those who tell you otherwise to go and see what is going on in that country."
"The third point is that the security situation has significantly deteriorated."
"In 2004, it was possible to walk around Kabul."
"Today, Kabul is a huge entrenched camp."
"Therefore, in failing to learn lessons from an operational failure on the ground and, ultimately, in applying only old methods, we are heading for a repeat of such failures."
"What are the consequences of all this?"
"I believe, in fact, that it must be recognised that we have dismantled al-Qaeda - that is a genuine finding - and that we must pull out."
"Can we pull out straight away, today?"
"No, because if we pulled out, it would undoubtedly cause chaos, and would perhaps lead to the return of those camps that we are combating."
"Our withdrawal must therefore come with some conditions attached."
"Firstly, as everyone says, we must hand over the keys to the Afghans themselves; we must ensure that the conflict is an Afghan conflict."
"Secondly, a dialogue must be established with all the insurgents, and note that I did not say 'with the Taliban', because the word 'Taliban' is very restrictive."
"Thirdly, a social level must be accepted that is not perfect."
"Let us not think that our European criteria are criteria that should be adapted to Afghanistan."
"We must accept that."
"Madam President, it is always more difficult to conclude a military operation than it is to start it, and in order to be able to conclude it, we must keep in mind the initial objective, which was to ensure that the al-Qaeda camps were dismantled."
"This has been done today."
"(PT) The Council says that the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has a direct impact on Europe."
"That, in fact, is the principal message that we have to be able to put across honestly and courageously to Europe's citizens."
"In that respect, I welcome the EU's new action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which includes investing in a huge programme of capacity building at all levels in the Afghan administration."
"Effectively implementing this action plan, as a means of unifying European efforts in Afghanistan, is the only way to contribute to the state building that is necessary to put an end to the war and to underdevelopment."
"Europe cannot abandon the Afghans, and it is not there because the Americans have so decided."
"The international military and civilian presence will continue to be needed there for many years to come."
"To conclude, I strongly condemn the French Government's decision to forcibly repatriate Afghans who have fled the war in their country."
"(DE) Madam President, if there is one thing that we really do not need in the bitter reality being experienced in Afghanistan, it is pretentious speeches."
"I am looking in your direction, Baroness Ashton, when I say that."
"You talked about the Member States being committed to the police training mission EUPOL."
"Is that really the case?"
"If so, how can it be that we still do not even have the 400 police officers in place?"
"That is a mixture of disingenuousness and absurdity."
"Are we being honest in what we say?"
"As far back as two years ago it was stated in the European Security Review that the low number of police instructors calls into question the reality of Europe's commitment."
"Why are we not financing the trained police officers to prevent them from joining the warlords or the Taliban?"
"It would not cost much and it would be very efficient."
"I have the impression, Baroness Ashton, that Europe is full of high-sounding talk, but it is shameful how small and inadequate its actions are."
"(DE) Madam President, the heading chosen here of a 'new action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan' is an appropriate one."
"However, what has been presented here seems to me to be more like two separate action plans presented one after the other."
"I essentially support what has been said about both countries."
"In Afghanistan, I hope that we have learnt from the mistakes of the past and that we will adapt our policies and structures accordingly."
"As regards Pakistan, I am pleased that the new policy is seen as a follow-up to my election observation report."
"In the countries in which we have carried out election observation missions, I believe that it is only right that we incorporate the recommendations into our specific policies towards those countries."
"In the response to this debate from the Council and the Commission, I would like the joint strategy for these two countries to be explained more clearly, as we have to acknowledge, for example, that we have a thousand kilometre border in this region that cannot be controlled properly on either side, while the policies that we pursue on one side of this border will have direct effects on the other side."
"Therefore, what structures do we actually want to set up?"
"How do we want to establish the dialogue between the Afghan and the Pakistani Governments?"
"How can we ensure that our policies are accepted by the local people there?"
"These are questions to which we still need answers, and I hope that we will get them."
"Madam President, the plan of action on Afghanistan and Pakistan adopted last October is, in itself, a good document."
"Its aim is to create the conditions for returning responsibility from the international community, including the EU, to the Afghan state, with the former in a support role."
"The same is envisaged by the US in the security sector."
"It is hoped that the additional 30 000 US troops will create a situation in which responsibility could be handed over to the Afghan forces by 2011 when the US withdrawal will commence."
"Even if both the EU and the US have similar aims, namely creating the conditions for the Afghan state to take responsibility for its own affairs, the timeframe for achieving those aims is inevitably different."
"Adequate security will have to be achieved by 2011, while state building will inevitably take longer."
"The question, then, is: supposing adequate security is either not achieved by 2011 or deteriorates again after the US pull-out, will the EU, already involved in state building, be ready to take over the task of providing security too?"
"I think not - and then we have a problem."
"(ES) Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union's commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan."
"I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned."
"Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January."
"At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States."
"We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking."
"I am rather alarmed at reports in today's press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama's decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent."
"In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner."
"What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan."
"Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said."
"The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan."
"We cannot fail."
"In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens."
"This support is conditional on transparency and clarity."
"We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option."
"As I have said, many important factors are at stake."
"(DE) Madam President, an Afghan friend once said to me that it is a good thing that the West invaded Afghanistan, but remember that, in Afghan history, anyone who stayed longer than a year became an occupier, even if they previously went there as liberators."
"That was in 2001."
"We are now in 2009 and exactly that has happened."
"The Taliban governs de facto 80% of the country and the US military leadership as well as the European defence ministers are saying that this war cannot be won by military means."
"What, then, is the goal?"
"A country that we do not have under control cannot be turned into a democracy and whatever else from the centre if that country has never had a centralised form of government."
"In other words, would it not make sense to concentrate on al-Qaeda and terrorism and then get out of there?"
"These questions need to be answered."
"We also need answers to the questions that were, quite rightly, raised by Mr Van Orden in connection with the integration of this action plan with the general strategic goal, the London Conference, President Obama's Afghanistan plan and so on. Are these things consistent with each other?"
"It is therefore very right and necessary to have a combined approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan here, and also to include what was ultimately said in connection with India."
"Most importantly, we need to keep an eye on internal developments."
"When foreign military pressure leaves a country having trained soldiers and police officers who have no goal of their own, I have never known these soldiers and police officers to then leave behind the ideology of the civil war, which does indeed have a goal."
"It always wins!"
"History shows this, too, and therefore I am deeply concerned that what we are doing here may lack continuity."
"We really should consider what sort of plan would enable us to get our troops out in a reasonable manner and, at the same time, to put an end to terrorism."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the security situation in Afghanistan recently became much worse due to the lack of full control on the ground."
"Vast areas of the country are governed by tribal rule and no longer, therefore, by national law."
"The sense of insecurity has also spread to the main cities, despite the ongoing commitment and monitoring action of the ISAF forces."
"Since the fight against terrorism is closely connected to activities carried out on the ground, it is clear that the United States, allied countries and NATO cannot withdraw."
"Our continued presence and the achievement of success in Afghanistan depend greatly on a political and military approach that is shared at international level and aimed at a regional approach on the ground within both Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"In this sense, the new European Union action plan represents a significant step in the strengthening of security and in the delicate process of capacity building where democratic institutions, human rights and socio-economic development within the region are concerned."
"(PL) Madam President, I think the European Union action plan is going in the right direction, because our assistance must concern two areas."
"The first is an improvement in security."
"The second is an improvement in the conditions under which people live."
"It can be said that progress in the first area - concerning security - will have a beneficial effect on the conditions under which people live, while progress in the second area - concerning an improvement in the conditions under which people live - will foster an improvement in security."
"I think, however, that we should continually ask about the effectiveness of our assistance."
"In my opinion, it could be much more effective if we could count on support from the states which surround Central Asia."
"I would especially like to encourage the European Union, Mrs Ashton and Mrs Malmström to make contact with Russia and Tajikistan, because these are countries which could be very helpful, especially concerning logistics and the transportation of supplies for the population."
"Madam President, today, terrorist bombings are a daily occurrence in both Afghanistan and Pakistan."
"Schools, shopping centres, town centres and even military headquarters are under attack."
"The Pakistani military is successfully pushing back infiltrators into Pakistan from Afghanistan, but I have to ask myself: from where are these terrorists continuing to get their weapons?"
"It is far too simplistic to argue that it is a Pakistani internal issue in itself."
"It is much more complex than that."
"Minister Malmström, quite rightly, raised the issue of regional cooperation."
"Through our new foreign affairs role, High Representative, will we be speaking to Pakistan's neighbours to encourage them to do all that they can to help Pakistan through this difficult time?"
"It is also quite right that, whilst mutual mistrust exists between Pakistan and India - and I am a great proponent of bringing these two countries together - there is very little progress that we will make."
"As long as the core issue of Kashmir is not dealt with, I am afraid that we will not make a huge amount of progress."
"(SL) In my opinion, the action plan for Afghanistan will only make sense if it underlines our European policy, that is, the European approach to Afghanistan."
"We are already deeply involved there and we cannot just go along with the decisions of our major allies, surprising us as they do with some of their strategic decisions."
"What I think is important about this action plan is that it clearly gives priority to civilian initiatives."
"We should bury the ideas of a military victory once and for all."
"We cannot win in a territory whose population considers all of us who are there to help as occupiers and the Taliban as so-called freedom fighters."
"I should like to join those of you who have stressed the need for a regional solution and the need for greater involvement of the countries in the region which border Afghanistan."
"They have the greater confidence of the people."
"(FR) Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan."
"Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan."
"This is a mission that we must carry out."
"The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible."
"I would have liked more to have been said about this."
"My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too."
"I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security."
"In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border."
"I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects."
"(RO) For well over eight years, our countries have been wasting human lives, energy and huge financial resources in a country ravaged by war where two empires, the British and Soviet empires, had already been bogged down."
"Unfortunately, the political and military reinforcement of the Taliban's influence, the poverty devastating this country, the status of women, the opium trade and widespread corruption are all facts of life which highlight the failure of the operations currently being conducted in Afghanistan."
"I believe that the European Union's strategy must counter the growing prospect of chaos and violence through strengthening the military presence and making it more effective, as well as through stepping up the efforts for reconstruction, development and democratisation in Afghanistan."
"Increased development assistance in Afghanistan basically means an investment in our own security."
"This is why we must make every endeavour to keep this failed state afloat and guarantee its citizens a minimum level of physical and material security."
"(PL) Mr President, the situation in Afghanistan is, today, the most important problem facing international institutions and, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, the European Union in particular."
"This challenge cannot be met without three elements in our strategy: firstly, the success of a very ambitious, two-year military mission, which must end in defeat of al-Qaeda and reception of part of the Taliban leadership to the government side."
"Secondly, stability in Pakistan and the entire region, including India - this is a second, key challenge - and thirdly, the need to build civil society."
"Thirty years of war is a huge problem."
"It is an uneducated society - over 90% of the people cannot read."
"In relation to this, a huge amount of social assistance is needed in order to build a state of law, good governance and social care."
"I want to say that, today, the number of children attending school in Afghanistan has risen from 700 000 to 7 000 000, and in relation to this, one of the key matters facing Mrs Ashton is, in particular, the need for effective financial aid to build civil society in Afghanistan."
"(DE) Mr President, perhaps you would allow me, as a member of the Iran Delegation, to just make one brief comment."
"A while ago, the European Parliament in Brussels held a debate with the Iranian ambassador in Brussels."
"When asked why the number of death sentences in Iran had quadrupled since the Iranian President took office, he put it down to the increase in the drugs trade in the border region between Iran and Afghanistan."
"I wanted to mention this statement to you in order that, alongside corruption, this problem might also be given adequate consideration in the action plan."
"Mr President, the Council is genuinely grateful for the huge commitment shown by the European Parliament on this issue."
"I will answer some of your questions."
"Mr Kasoulides: the action plan takes the regional perspective as its starting point."
"It is absolutely central."
"Enormous emphasis is placed on good governance, combating corruption and the principles of the rule of law, and this is the work that is guiding the EU."
"In these areas, Afghanistan and Pakistan will need our support for a very, very long time to come."
"Mr Kasoulides is right in saying that we have not given sufficient attention to the drugs issue."
"We support the efforts being made, for example, the UNIDOC cooperation and technical assistance."
"This must continue."
"Most important of all, of course, is to support the work that the Afghan government is doing to create greater prosperity and good social governance."
"To Mr Arlacchi, I would say that we agree that the efforts made to date have not been sufficiently coordinated."
"That is a problem for the EU, and that is why it is so important for us to have this plan now."
"The Swedish Presidency has also struggled hard during the autumn to obtain the type of information that you ask about - who is doing what, and how much - and to get an overall view of what is happening."
"We now have a better picture and we are very much looking forward to your report, which can help us as we move forward with this work, as well as to cooperating with you and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I would say to Mr Danjean that EUPOL is a very important element in our cooperation and the most important element for the Afghan Government as regards civil police work."
"It has emerged that there is very strong leadership in place."
"The qualities of EUPOL are recognised by all parties - the Afghans, the US and other parties."
"We have increased the workforce by 280 international personnel."
"We regret that the Member States have not been able to provide the 400 personnel that we require, and we are currently calling for further contributions because we want the Member States to be involved."
"As things stand at present, EUPOL is consolidating its activities into six strategic areas where we believe value can be added: police intelligence, investigating crime, the command structure in the police, links between police and prosecutors, combating corruption and also human rights and equality."
"These are the Afghan priorities."
"NATO is now to become involved in police training through its training mission and naturally, we need to intensify our cooperation in this area."
"Finally, I would like to say that the action plan is incredibly important in enabling the EU to use its resources in a better, more coordinated way."
"We must now focus on implementing all these good ideas."
"We can do this through the regional perspective, through the responsibility taken by the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan themselves and by focusing on our political priorities, the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"The EU is one partner."
"A very important partner, but there are other partners in the region, too, and naturally, we must cooperate with them."
"We are looking forward to the London conference at which we hope President Karzai will present his plans, and we are looking forward to increasing our support after that."
"The EU's support is long-term and enduring, and it must be sustainable."
"That is the signal we must send out."
"This is going to take time."
"We have to be realistic."
"We have an enormous amount of work ahead of us."
"That is why we need the EU to be committed."
"We need to send out a signal that we are in it for the long haul - not least for the sake of the women and children, as many Members have mentioned."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, I will just pick up, if I may, a few key points which were raised by honourable Members."
"Agreeing with the Presidency on the issues of narcotics, what we have sought to do is develop a comprehensive response which really brings together the rural development aspects of it with social issues and, of course, the rule of law."
"It is very important to tackle it from all of the different perspectives."
"I agree with what honourable Members were saying about the importance of civilian issues."
"We have actually made significant progress; a number of Members were concerned about that."
"Just one example: in 2002, we had health care take-up support of around 7% of the population; it is now at 85% in 2009."
"I can give other examples; that is just one where I think we can absolutely show what we are doing and how effective it has been on the ground."
"I agree, too, with what was said by Members such as Mrs Lambert about education being absolutely core to what we do in terms of support for children and also of course in terms of training for employment with adults."
"The funds: I am pleased to say that actually, these are very well-run funds."
"They are managed through the UN or through the World Bank and I think honourable Members receive a state of play report."
"The last one I have here is dated July 2009."
"For those who have not seen it, we can make sure you receive copies."
"It demonstrates in very clear terms exactly where the money is going, exactly what it is being spent on and what we hope to achieve by that."
"But I do agree that we need to be more efficient."
"There is always room for that."
"One of the challenges of my role is to bring together what is happening on the ground, to make it more coherent and make it work more effectively."
"A number of colleagues have mentioned the need to make sure we fulfil the commitments on EUPOL."
"It was mentioned that we have to work collaboratively with NATO;"
"I have already had one meeting with the Secretary-General of NATO and I was at the meeting with General McChrystal and Richard Holbrook and with Secretary of State Clinton, to talk about Afghanistan."
"We are already building up to the London Conference in our dialogue with those important and key partners on the ground."
"Of course, what has been said about the regional aspects is extremely important."
"We do want as part of the action plan to pull together that regional cooperation."
"There is work going on: very practical work to develop that, particularly rail links and trade cooperation and so on."
"The London Conference on 28 January is the next significant milestone and will raise issues of security, governance, and social, economic and regional development - very important issues."
"Issues that I have identified are education, health, economic development, trade, justice and human rights, all of them issues on which I can say that I have a great deal of experience."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan is designed to implement the EU's strategic ambition to play an even more active imperialist role in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the area as a whole."
"In Pakistan, it is promoting a free trade agreement which will allow greater penetration of the euro-unifying monopolies in southern Asia."
"In Afghanistan, it is seeking to stabilise its presence even further, both independently, with the EUPOL policing mission in Afghanistan, and within NATO, with the development of the European Gendarmerie Force."
"Imperialist infighting for a share of the spoils is hotting up, despite the strategy of cooperation with the USA and NATO."
"The EU is endeavouring, with a package of money worth EUR 1 billion a year and various 'development programmes', to strengthen the position of European capital in plundering the occupied country and acquiring a springboard for the exploitation of the peoples and wealth in the area as a whole."
"At the same time, the 'democracy export' policy is trying to expand support for democracy to the imperialist occupying structure."
"The peoples cannot choose the 'better imperialist'."
"They must step up their fight against the plans of all the imperialists, in order to shake off the yoke of occupation in Afghanistan and the area as a whole."
"The problems affecting Afghanistan and Pakistan are not confined only to these countries."
"They actually affect us all."
"The mission launched in Afghanistan must be brought to a conclusion."
"With this in mind, Romania is openly considering the possibility of increasing its involvement in this country, including reinforcements for training the army and providing medical and institutional support."
"Romania currently has 1 020 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan whose involvement in guaranteeing peace and stability is unanimously appreciated by our allies."
"We need to be involved not only on the military front, but also in strengthening the Afghan state's institutions, providing governance at local and regional level, combating corruption and drug trafficking, training police officers and providing technical assistance for agricultural development."
"In this regard, I would like to mention the announcement made by Catherine Ashton about increasing the funds which the European Commission is allocating for development in Afghanistan."
"The European Union's actions in Afghanistan and Pakistan must be coordinated."
"The situations in both countries are closely linked and success in one depends on the other."
"The European Union must continue its partnership with Pakistan and help this country in its battle against extremism and terrorism, as well as with regard to commercial relations and promoting human rights."
"Sufficient international presence must be ensured to help establish basic conditions of peace and security in order to enable the capacity of the country's government to be strengthened, the rule of law to be reinforced, corruption to be combated and human rights respected."
"When I speak of government, I am also referring to the subnational level, the level nearer to citizens, and to governance in the broad sense, including all stakeholders in Afghanistan."
"The country's development and the development of agriculture, infrastructure and the commercial fabric urgently require a climate of peace and stability and, above all, the protection of citizens by combating impunity and the legal insecurity that directly affects them."
"Nonetheless, the daily, urgent problems faced by the citizens must not be overlooked."
"These problems are not limited to security and relate to food, health and education."
"Afghanistan will survive, and it will do so thanks to the strength and efforts of the Afghan people themselves."
"We must, however, lend them a hand and, in particular, we must not take it away before time, when they need it the most."
"If there is a striking example anywhere in the world of the inability of the EU to adopt an independent position on a problem created by the United States, then it is the current unhappy situation in Afghanistan: a shattered infrastructure, several generations with minimal chances of obtaining an education, mediaeval conditions in terms of gender equality and the global standard for absolute corruption."
"It is a situation which, together with production of more than 70% of the world's opium output and increased activity from terrorist groups, shows the complete impotence of the occupying power."
"The well-known examples of injustice, even against elected representatives, together with the unlawful practices of the US administration, have created an unstable environment."
"The constant references to the lack of respect for human dignity under Soviet occupation are a futile attempt to cover up the current chaos and anarchy."
"With more than two million refugees in Pakistan and a porous border between the states, there are excellent preconditions for the penetration of armed groups into the southern and eastern parts of the country."
"The Pashtun tribes have long lived on both sides of the border and it is difficult in the current chaos to find out who comes from where."
"The EP resolution of 2008 describes this situation accurately but it must be said that the optimistic assertions are out of place."
"In the current situation, a strengthening of the military presence and further transfers of financial resources and teams of experts is completely nonsensical."
"The situation has deteriorated markedly over the past year and the optimistic assertions of the European Commission are not based on the current reality in Afghanistan."
"It is imperative we take action to improve the situation in Afghanistan."
"In particular, important measures are: training of police officers, military personnel, people employed in the justice system and teachers, as well as combating the production of and trade in drugs."
"This will enable stabilisation of the social system in Afghanistan."
"Undoubtedly, it is also necessary to increase the military and police contingent and redouble efforts in the areas bordering Pakistan, to prevent the flow of arms and drugs between the two countries."
"It is already worth thinking about the direction in which the Afghan economy should develop in the future, so that the people will be able to give up growing poppies and trading opium."
"In a word, military and police action should be accompanied by civil measures: support in establishing the structures of an Afghan state and development aid."
"Belarus (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Belarus."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the EU's relationship with Belarus is not without its complications."
"I would like to begin this debate by explaining why the Council took its decision in November concerning the EU's relations with Belarus."
"I know that this issue is one that is of great interest to many Members."
"When we discussed this, we focused on two important aspects."
"On the one hand, the EU wanted to send a clear signal that we are not happy with the lack of positive progress in recent months."
"On the other, we wanted to establish the subsequent steps within the framework of our dialogue with Belarus, with the aim of encouraging Minsk to take action in a number of areas."
"I feel that the result was a well-balanced decision that takes these aspects into account."
"It has three main elements."
"Firstly, we are extending our sanctions while, at the same time, suspending the travel restrictions for almost all the individuals concerned."
"The exceptions are four people directly linked to the political disappearances and the chair of Belarus's Central Electoral Commission."
"Secondly, we are open to the possibility of visa facilitation and readmission agreements between the EU and Belarus."
"Thirdly, there is the prospect of a partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Belarus."
"Naturally, this would require positive developments as regards democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law."
"The Commission has been asked to carry out some preparatory work based on these action plans, which were developed within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"In our discussions, we took into account the fact that the situation in Belarus is better than it was 18 months ago, despite the fact that there have been some backward steps."
"The expulsion of a student from university after taking part in an Eastern Partnership forum is a very serious example of this."
"The transition from an authoritarian society to democracy - as many Members of this House know extremely well - is a gradual process."
"It will take time for Belarus and there will be many obstacles along the way."
"Our full support is therefore required."
"The global financial crisis is actually providing opportunities for influence."
"Belarus's economy is on its knees and Russia is no longer prepared to underwrite the country."
"In the energy sector, the low gas prices are just a memory."
"Can we then exploit this situation to encourage Belarus to change track?"
"There is no other way than through dialogue."
"We must help to strengthen the cautious movement towards greater openness."
"We have to consider how effective our sanctions policy is."
"Last year's decision to suspend visa restrictions after Minsk had released the final prisoners in August 2008 helped bring about some progress in our dialogue."
"The use of sanctions is an important way for the European Union to exert pressure."
"At the same time, the Commission has taken a number of steps aimed at cooperation with Belarus and the country is part of the Eastern Partnership."
"Our support for Belarus within the International Monetary Fund has also been a positive step."
"We have set out the conditions, and now we must proceed reasonably and prudently."
"The decision to extend the suspension of the visa prohibition list sent a signal that we are serious about rewarding positive steps that are taken."
"If things continue to develop in this direction, we can go a step further."
"At the moment, discussions are focusing on two possible alternatives."
"One is the development of a formal agreement and the other is the possibility of visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"The position taken by the Council has laid the foundation for more specific consideration of these issues."
"A partnership and cooperation agreement could result in us formalising the relationship between the EU and Belarus in a new way."
"It is a way of combining conditionality with our various means of exerting pressure within the framework of a legally binding agreement."
"A partnership and cooperation agreement would also allow Belarus to participate fully in the bilateral element of the Eastern Partnership."
"Where visa facilitation is concerned, the intention is that this will be aimed at ordinary people, the general public, rather than at the political elite."
"It would represent an important opportunity to encourage contacts between civil society and the citizens of Belarus and the EU."
"It could become a crucial factor in opening up and influencing Belarusian culture."
"It is entirely in line with the aims of the Eastern Partnership."
"Visa facilitation is linked with readmission."
"This should not be a great problem, since Belarus has demonstrated its ability to cooperate on matters related to border controls."
"Belarus is in an important location on the eastern border of the EU."
"Consequently, we have an interest in seeing Belarus modernise, develop and move towards becoming a democratic, free country."
"The importance of having democratic neighbouring countries is a cornerstone of our security strategy."
"We must work to instil our values - such as democracy, a market economy and respect for human rights - in Belarus."
"There is a clear parallel here with how we develop partnerships with a number of countries to both the east and the south."
"I would like to end by emphasising that naturally, we must continue to set clear conditions in our relations with Belarus."
"The country must continue to move forward."
"President Lukashenko's repressive policies must be replaced by greater democracy and greater tolerance."
"The principles of the rule of law must be respected."
"This is the message that we are sending in all the bilateral contacts that take place between the Member States and Belarus."
"Dialogue is essential if our demands are to bring results."
"That is why we on the Council have also welcomed the increased contacts aimed at strengthening a transition to democracy."
"We will continue to develop our support for the democracy movement and civil society which are working for reform and European integration in Belarus."
"We are very grateful for the significant support and commitment demonstrated by the European Parliament in this work."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, dear colleagues, Council President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to discuss with you today our very important but also our very challenging relationship with Belarus."
"I think it is important because Belarus lies at a crossroads on our continent; and it is challenging because Belarus' own choices for its own future, and for its relationship with the EU, remain unclear."
"It still remains to be seen what they will be, so we will have to go on working with them."
"Over the last two years, the European Union has sought gradually to engage with Belarus and to encourage further reforms, to build on the, I have to say, modest measures taken so far."
"I am convinced that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism."
"Our engagement with that country needs to reflect positive steps by Belarus itself, but we also have to show at least some flexibility."
"We have signalled clearly that we would like to see Belarus take its place as a fully fledged participant in the European neighbourhood policy, and that the bilateral track of the Eastern Partnership can be opened to Belarus if it shows through sustained action its wish to make irreversible steps towards democratic reform."
"In the meantime, we have shown our goodwill in a number of important ways."
"A number of EU high-level visits to Belarus this year helped strengthen political exchanges."
"We launched a dialogue on human rights issues in June 2009."
"The Commission is engaged in a growing number of technical dialogues with Belarus on issues of mutual interest."
"Last month, for instance, the External Relations Council decided to extend existing restrictive measures, notably the visa ban and the assets freeze, till October 2010, given the lack of significant progress on human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"However, to encourage democratic progress, the Council also extended the suspension of the restrictive measures."
"And the Council also took two further decisions to encourage Belarus to stay on the path of reforms."
"I very much welcome that the Commission can now start working on the visa facilitation issue, and on a shadow ENP action plan, the 'joint interim plan'."
"These steps provide an incentive for moves towards democracy in Belarus, which I am confident will be well understood, on the one hand, by the government, but, on the other hand, particularly by the people."
"The joint interim plan will be developed with both the authorities and civil society in Belarus, and I hope it will open the door to deeper dialogue with Belarus, including on delicate political issues."
"My services are preparing recommendations with a view to negotiating directives on visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"Visa facilitation is a priority for the Belarusian people, and I would like to see more Belarusians visiting the European Union, travelling freely, studying and doing business."
"But naturally, the final decision on the negotiation directives will lie with the Council."
"In addition, the Commission is prepared to increase the allocations of financial assistance to Belarus for the period of 2010-2013."
"We have proposed a package of macro-financial assistance worth EUR 200 million, for which we are seeking the approval of Parliament."
"The Commission is supporting the idea of the EIB including Belarus in the Bank's new mandate."
"I really hope this will go further."
"However, if Belarus wishes to come closer to the EU, it is clear it must show this through its actions."
"There must be an end to political prisoners and politically motivated prosecutions."
"Reform of the electoral legislation in line with OSCE/ODIHR recommendations is sorely needed."
"The liberty of the press, freedom of speech and of assembly should be permitted and become the norm."
"The European Union also encourages Belarus to abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty."
"We call for improved conditions for NGOs, civil society and human rights activists."
"All these steps could play their part in accelerating the development of a closer partnership between Belarus and the European Union."
"In conclusion, therefore, our offer to Belarus is clear."
"The European Union is ready to work closely with Minsk and support its political and economic development."
"But we would welcome significant positive steps from the Belarus leadership which would allow us to develop our relationship in the same way as we do with other eastern partners if they play their part."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, why has my political group insisted on having the resolution after the debate?"
"Not only to express our support for the decision taken by the Council - because this is a wise decision and a proper decision and I agree with both your arguments - but the main reason is the increase in repression that has happened in Belarus quite recently."
"The resolution will refer to all those cases and, if any are abandoned during the drafting of the resolution, you may be sure they will be proposed as an amendment, either by the EPP in written form or by me in oral form tomorrow."
"There is another issue which has been revealed by the media only today, namely a new draft law prepared by Alexander Lukashenko designed to totally control the Internet, as in China or even in North Korea."
"I think that we should also refer to that."
"Why are these issues happening in Belarus?"
"My private opinion is that it is partly due to the unconsidered - let me say, unwise - visits by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who met Alexander Lukashenko and praised him as a democratically elected leader but did not find time to meet with the opposition, and also, a little earlier, by the President of Lithuania, who has invited Lukashenko to Lithuania, in an ill-considered way, I would say."
"Finally, let me refer to this morning's speech by Sergei Kovalev who said, citing Sakharov, that the Western world should offer and demand."
"This is the issue."
"We should offer deep cooperation with Belarus, but we should also demand from the Belarus authorities real progress in the area of human rights, democracy and freedom."
"Minister, Commissioner, I cannot but agree with the assessment that Belarus is a difficult partner for the European Union."
"However, we cannot support the approach which the Commission and Council have been adopting in relation to this country during the last year."
"This approach, based on a gradual opening of the door to Belarus, linked to appropriate decisions made by the authorities in Belarus, does not seem to us to be the best way for this country to gradually turn into or, at least, come as close as possible to our idea of a democratic country."
"We would like to see slightly more substance in the measures which the European Commission and Council are adopting, as well as slightly more focus on the actual citizens of Belarus, because this is the way to get the citizens themselves to rally behind the cause which we are trying to promote there in dialogue with the Belarusian authorities, namely, democratisation, openness and the holding of free and democratic elections."
"In present-day Europe, it is inconceivable that this process cannot happen in a European country."
"The problems we have with regard to the Eastern Partnership are linked to this issue as well."
"You are aware that the European Parliament does not support official relations with the Belarusian Parliament because we consider that MPs in Belarus are not elected in fair and democratic elections, which means that this parliament cannot be our official partner."
"Also connected with this is the imminent establishment of an Eastern Partnership Parliamentary Assembly, which is facing certain problems."
"However, our approach will be to try, along with the Commission and Council, to pursue a common strategy so that we are ready at parliamentary level as well to implement appropriate measures for Belarus, if the Belarusians, on their side, implement their measures and fulfil the demands which we are making of them."
"In this regard, I urge the European Parliament, the European Commission and Council to join forces in their efforts in order to avoid independent actions, such as those of Prime Minister Berlusconi, which harm the general cause and give further encouragement to Lukashenko."
"This must be avoided."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to put forward one more proposal, because relations are really frozen between the Parliament and the authorities, but we do have relations with the opposition."
"My proposal is that I will propose to organise a conference, in Latvia or somewhere else, at which there would be participants from the authorities and from the opposition."
"The themes of the conference would be, firstly: energy, security, economy, transit problems, which, in Belarus, are very significant, as also for the EU; secondly: visa questions, neighbourhood questions regarding citizens; thirdly: the problems with the democratic situation, party problems and human rights; and fourthly: the real view from the Belarus side - how they see the Eastern Partnership in the near future."
"At the end of the day, I believe that this is one of the ways in which we could bring about a thaw in the frozen situation that we really do have."
"It has to be a two-way street, because with a one-way street, we will not succeed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, about two weeks ago, the Italian Prime Minister became the first Western Head of Government for many years to visit Belarus."
"He praised the work and policies of President Lukashenko and acknowledged the high election turn-out as being an expression of the high level of admiration and love of the people for their president."
"Unfortunately, he forgot to visit the opposition, which would otherwise be customary."
"The response was not to acknowledge the fact that steps had been taken towards liberalisation in Belarus; instead, the line taken towards the opposition became less tolerant."
"It resulted in repression and there was jostling, brawling and the like."
"This is also why we have tabled this resolution today, in order to make it clear which powers and which civil society approaches we support and to clarify the fact that we will only be able to talk about a partnership - something that is, of course, as yet on ice - once we are also able to fully continue the human rights dialogue with Belarus."
"This means freedom of speech, freedom of expression, the freedom of the opposition to work, the allowance of opposition parties and so on. We believe that this is important and that it must define our partnership in the future."
"We hope that the European Union will find a common line here and that the future High Representative will also put a lot of effort into promoting it."
"Mr President, Belarus, a Central European country, is the historical cradle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania."
"The Duchy defended the values of Western civilisation in its north-eastern periphery."
"Therefore, it is good that the Council's conclusions of 17 November this year provide for new opportunities for dialogue, as well as greater cooperation between the European Union and Belarus."
"However, we must move from words and gestures to something concrete."
"Let us begin with people-to-people relations."
"These must be strengthened by including Belarus in processes at European and regional levels."
"I call on the Commission to speedily prepare recommendations on directives for the simplification of visa regimes, and on the complete abolition of the visa regime within the 50km border zone."
"People in the centre of Europe must have rights and opportunities to move freely to both sides."
"I have read through the draft resolutions on the issue in question carefully and I have listened with interest to the discussion."
"It seems to me that most of the drafts submitted attempt to make a positive change to the hitherto cool relations between the EU and Belarus."
"I regard the Eastern Partnership project as a good opportunity to bring about a significant improvement in our relations."
"I would like to emphasise firstly that in the economic sphere, a pragmatic approach predominates but it cannot be merely a one-sided process."
"The EU must also open up to Belarusian goods and services."
"Secondly, it is essential, in my opinion, to release rapidly the financial resources for Belarus within the framework of the Eastern Partnership."
"Thirdly, dialogue could be assisted through a relaxation of the EU's visa policy."
"Fourthly, we should give more support to the environmental component of our cooperation."
"We all know that Belarus suffered from the Chernobyl disaster and our assistance will be more than welcome."
"Although I understand the historical and political circumstances of Belarus, I firmly believe that the time has also come for Belarus to join the ranks of those countries that have outlawed the death penalty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to the previous speaker, I wish to reiterate the right of any Head of State or Government to visit governments within or outside Europe, provided that this is consistent with the wishes of the Council."
"I therefore find this preventive censure of the Italian Prime Minister very annoying."
"However, to return to the matter in hand, in signing up to the Eastern Partnership, Belarus has demonstrated its will to throw in its lot with Europe on the road to economic development and reform."
"The Commission has recognised certain progress made in Belarus, such as the release of political prisoners, reform of the electoral code and the possibility for certain opposition newspapers to circulate, albeit under government control."
"This does not mean full-blown democracy but is certainly a departure from the past."
"The European Union is therefore faced with the choice of encouraging reform through dialogue within the Eastern Partnership and within Euronest and, at the same time, maintaining a policy of vigilance over the results achieved and steps taken."
"I therefore agree that Mr Vigenin should be given the task of reaching agreement with Minsk over a satisfactory representation in the Euronest Assembly that is not limited only to civil society but includes members of the Belarus Parliament."
"This would enable us to engage in a dialogue with the political decision makers on subjects including human rights and to establish a channel of communication with the government to support the process of reform."
"They would then have no excuse for failing to respond or providing unsatisfactory answers."
"(SK) Belarus deserves more attention, both from the EU and the European Parliament."
"I definitely approve of our offer of a helping hand as long as the response of the other side is specifically measurable and adequate."
"We must, however, be principled in our demands."
"The beneficiaries will then be democracy, good relations between the EU and Belarus and definitely the citizens of that country."
"I therefore welcome the invitation to Belarus to join the Euronest joint parliamentary assembly on the clear condition of a 5+5 format for delegates, which is strongly supported by the European Parliament."
"On the other hand, the gross breach of principle in relation to official visits of EU member representatives is regrettable."
"One such principle which is required on an official visit to Belarus is a meeting with the opposition."
"It is precisely this principle that was flagrantly breached through the absence of such a meeting in the recent visit by the leader of an influential Member State of the EU."
"Behaviour of this sort deals a blow to our efforts, damages the good name of the European Union and its institutions and definitely does not help to strengthen democracy in Belarus."
"(LT) For six years in the European Parliament, I have maintained and continue to maintain that the European Union will do most good for the citizens of Belarus and the EU, especially those living in neighbouring countries, not by implementing sanctions or restrictions, but by opening the doors as wide as possible to cooperation among people, in particular the young, and to closer contacts in business, culture, science and other areas."
"It is very good that for a second year, Brussels is pragmatically striving for change by moving closer to Belarus and its people."
"Yes, that policy has yet to yield all the positive results expected, but to return to the past would really be wrong."
"Therefore, I support the actions of the Council and the Commission, in particular, the prospect of an action plan for Belarus."
"When the new EU countries joined the Schengen Agreement two years ago, the remains of the Berlin wall, metaphorically speaking, shifted to the East."
"Whereas before, residents of Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Belarus, often related, were able to travel to each other without any taxes, now Belarusians must pay almost half their monthly salary for a Schengen visa."
"Such bureaucratic and financial walls must be torn down as soon as possible."
"On the other hand, Minsk's actions to delay the agreement with Lithuania and other states on facilitated passage for border inhabitants casts doubt over the authorities' goodwill."
"According to surveys, in Belarus around 30% of residents are in favour of better relations with the European Union."
"Meanwhile 28% of residents would like better relations with Russia."
"This is not a contradiction."
"The European Union really does not aim to tear Belarus from Russia or to make them enemies."
"It is not the West that needs reforms, but the Belarusians themselves."
"Well, dynamic economic modernisation and participation in the Eastern Partnership policy may help to carry out that task."
"(PL) Mr President, while listening to our debate, I have the impression we are saying too little about our main objective, which is free elections in Belarus."
"We should always give attention to this."
"As MEPs returned in democratic elections in our countries, we cannot ignore this main objective."
"I am convinced that both in the opposition and government camps, many people are waiting for us to talk about free elections."
"They, too, are waiting for this signal."
"I know this from my own experience."
"They deserve a clear and plain answer."
"We are fighting for Belarus to have free elections, and for Belarus to be a free partner in Europe."
"Yesterday, we were able to obtain a declaration from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on the Sarkozy Plan, for which I thank her."
"Today, I have another idea."
"I would like Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to make a clear declaration that until free elections are held in Belarus, there will not be any political contacts with the country in areas for which she is responsible, except for the opposition, which will not be excluded in this way."
"Please say this publicly."
"We will be much obliged to you for this."
"It will be a Christmas present for us."
"(NL) Mr President, at the start of this year, on Wednesday 14 January to be precise, I also had the honour of taking part in a debate in this House on Belarus, at which Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was also present."
"At the end of the parliamentary year, it is natural to look at whether there have been any significant changes in EU-Belarus relations; and, to my mind, 2009 has been characterised by the status quo between Minsk and Brussels."
"What conclusions should the European institutions draw from this?"
"First of all, the danger remains of President Lukashenko's regime in Belarus simply continuing to vacillate between Moscow and Brussels, or between feigned integration with Russia and feigned rapprochement with the European Union."
"On the one hand, there is Europe's economic affectivity; on the other, the desire of the Belarusian political elite to consolidate its power."
"The latest changes in position at the top political level in Minsk point to a harder line."
"The European Union should use a balanced strategy to seize the opportunity to bring about a gradual change in mentality at population and elite level, an opportunity arising from the dialogue and cooperation structures now established, combined with the global economic crisis, that also impels the Lukashenko Government to act."
"In short, all European institutions need to contact all Belarusian target groups to this end, including the state authorities, the opposition forces, civil society, and even the civilian population."
"Naturally, the European Parliament will also seek substantive contact with the Belarusian Parliament."
"(PL) The experiment with a thaw in relations between the Union and Belarus continues to yield ambiguous results."
"Political pressure from the European Union is, therefore, an essential condition for maintenance of the very weakly outlined direction of change in Minsk."
"Opening channels of communication with the authorities must go hand-in-hand with rejection of the undemocratic parliament in Minsk."
"We must also take scrupulous care that free Belarusians do not feel rejected, and so the thoughtless omission of meetings with representatives of the opposition is extremely irresponsible."
"Minsk must realise that our policy has one objective - democracy in Belarus."
"Political changes will be possible only when we ensure that Belarusians have access to independent information."
"A project which, today, demands our support is, in particular, the television station Belsat, which has, for two years, been broadcasting the only Belarusian-language channel giving access to uncensored information about the situation in the country, and is enjoying growing interest among Belarusians."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, I am particularly pleased that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, as our Commissioner, has always supported democracy and the market economy and has also set new standards in this regard in Belarus."
"In this connection, I would like to thank her most sincerely for her work as the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy and to wish her all the best for the future."
"(PL) Mr President, we have found ourselves in a situation which points to a kind of schizophrenia in our contacts with Belarus."
"For European leaders are talking with the President and with a Belarusian Government which represents the Belarusian Parliament and political system."
"This is good."
"However, we do not want to speak to a parliament which was returned in elections which were badly run and were neither free nor transparent, because we have our principles."
"This schizophrenia must come to an end at some point, and this should be said clearly."
"The definitive moment for us to say what our policy towards Belarus is are next year's local elections."
"Either they will be held in accordance with standards which we accept and will indicate significant openness, or they will not be held in this way and we will simply have to stop thinking about openness from Belarus, because it will be obvious that Mr Lukashenko knows what he wants, while we do not really know what we want."
"As for Mr Berlusconi, however, he has revealed a lot about himself, because if ideal leadership is, for him, what Lukashenko is doing, it means it is a model of leadership which impresses him, and we can only fold our arms and express regret that such a leader is to be found among the 27 leaders of the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, as a long-term Belarus watcher, it is important that the EU remains engaged with Belarus, which is a medium-sized European country and which is becoming increasingly self-isolated and turning itself into a kind of Cuba of Europe."
"President Lukashenko, who is a quintessentially Homo sovieticus type, nevertheless understands fully what power politics are all about and therefore we need to have a reasonable EU-Belarus trade and political contact and relationship. I therefore do agree that the targeted sanctions need to be eventually lifted and a PCA eventually ratified."
"So, after years of the EU isolating Belarus, I now agree that a pragmatic stick and carrot approach is the correct one."
"We must facilitate contacts with Belarus civil society and cheaper visa arrangements, and grant Belarus observer status in the Euronest Assembly, as well as access to the programmes of the Eastern Partnership."
"We have made a generous start, and I now call upon Minsk to meet us halfway by improving its human rights and democracy record."
"(DE) Mr President, the policy of the European Union towards Belarus is certainly an example of a sensible neighbourhood policy."
"We ought to thank the outgoing Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for her successful work in this regard."
"Belarus certainly should be supported by the European Union in its reform process and also in its democratisation."
"However, the European Union and the Member States of the European Union should not be so arrogant as to believe that their own democratic standards should be a model for the rest of the world."
"One thing is certain in relation to Belarus: if we want our relations with Russia to flourish, we will be obliged also to respect the historical and geopolitical interests of the Kremlin somewhere."
"That is probably the most sensitive issue in connection with European policy towards Belarus."
"(PL) There has been talk here of the need for youth and cultural exchange between the Union and Belarus."
"I am afraid this will be very difficult."
"On 3 December, Tatiana Szapućko, spokesperson for the opposition organisation Young Front, had her name struck off the list of students at the Faculty of Law of the Belarusian State University."
"Why was her name removed?"
"For taking part in a forum on the Eastern Partnership in Brussels."
"The university authorities took the view that she had left without their consent, and for this she was thrown out of the university."
"Perhaps for a woman in Belarus, this is not all that dangerous, but for men thrown out of university in Belarus, the results can be much more painful, because military service there is treated as a punishment, as a substitute for prison."
"There are young soldiers, such as Franek Wieczorka, head of the youth organisation called the Belarusian Youth Front, and Ivan Szyła, also from the organisation Young Front, who are being persecuted during military service, where they are cut off from access to information, and this is treated as a punishment."
"We should fight against this and should support those who are punished in this way."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think it is extremely valuable that we have such strong support among all the European institutions for the approach towards Belarus."
"It is, indeed, a very difficult partner, but it is our neighbour, a country with which we share borders. Some countries here have close and historic relations with the people there, so we must do our utmost to support the development towards democracy, human rights, the rule of law and market economy."
"We are concerned about certain backlashes lately, for instance, the young student who was expelled."
"The Swedish Presidency has reacted very firmly in Minsk and also issued lots of statements: it is, of course, something that we deplore and it should not happen."
"We have had lots of contact with civil society during this year."
"There was a conference just a few weeks ago in Brussels with civil society."
"I personally met opposition representatives in Stockholm a few weeks ago and there are continuous efforts to liaise with civil society and the opposition."
"They are weak but they are there and they need our support, and that support will continue."
"I think Mr Godmanis' idea on the conference theme is a very interesting one."
"It certainly merits being explored to see if we can move forward."
"This dual approach towards Belarus - the 'stick and carrot', as I think Mr Tannock called it - is hopefully the one that will succeed."
"It shows that we are truly committed, we stuck out our hands."
"We can show Mr Lukashenko and the Belarus regime that, if you move towards democracy, if you move towards respecting international values, there is another way for you."
"There is a way towards European integration; there is a way towards engagement with the European Union, towards visa facilitation and deepening of the Eastern Partnership."
"Now it is up to them to respond."
"We have given them our hand and, with the full support of all the European institutions, please, Minsk, take it, because you and the Belarus people have a lot to win."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to stress that I found - and I am also speaking on behalf of Benita Ferrero-Waldner, of course - our exchanges today to be very frank and extremely useful."
"I wish to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate."
"The EU is, in principle, ready to work closely with Minsk and support urgently needed political and economic reforms."
"Should there be significant steps from the Belarusian leadership in terms of democratisation, the EU would be prepared to see Belarus as a full member of the Eastern Partnership."
"In the meantime, the EU is, and will be, urging Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards, without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential."
"I sincerely hope that in 2010, we will be in a position to engage gradually and intelligently with Belarus and offer the Belarusian people a vision and tangible benefits of a close relationship with the EU."
"The EU expects Belarus to take a series of accompanying measures in the area of democratic reforms, with a view to coming closer to the EU and together help expand the area of peace, stability and prosperity involving all six Eastern Partnership countries, as well as Russia, the EU's strategic partner."
"There are five measures we expect Belarus to take resolutely and irreversibly."
"Firstly, to ensure there is no backtracking on political prisoners and politically motivated criminal prosecution."
"Secondly, carry out a thorough reform of the electoral legislation in line with OSCE/ODIHR recommendations."
"Thirdly, embark upon the liberalisation of the media environment, uphold freedom of speech and of assembly."
"Fourthly, improve through regulatory and legislative measures working conditions for NGOs."
"Fifthly, abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty."
"A significant move in showing Belarus' commitment to shared values would be the immediate introduction of a moratorium on the death penalty and its subsequent abolition as a crucial step forward on its path to Council of Europe membership."
"In its November conclusions, the Council of the EU urged Belarus to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty."
"Moreover, the Commission has carried out communication actions in the wake of the 10th International Day against the Death Penalty."
"What could the EU do for Belarus?"
"What is on offer?"
"The Commission believes that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism."
"Progressive EU engagement with Belarus needs to reflect positive steps by Belarus itself, but we also need to show flexibility."
"The November 2009 conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) allow the EU to offer incentives to Belarus for steps we want to see, while remaining true to our principles."
"This is what I mean by pragmatism."
"Our message to Belarus is clear."
"First, the EU is ready to work closely with Minsk and support its political and economic development and, should there be significant positive steps from the Belarusian leadership, we would be prepared to see Belarus as a full member of the Eastern Partnership."
"This would entail the development of our relationship through the bilateral track of the EAP, the launching of a thorough political and economic dialogue, as well as enhanced sectoral cooperation."
"In the meantime, Belarus was invited in May 2009 to join the multilateral dimension of the EAP."
"It is participating constructively at deputy minister level in the four multilateral forums - democracy and governance, economic integration, energy security and people-to-people contacts."
"Secondly, we expect Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards, without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential."
"Thirdly, the absence of a PCA is not only a loss to Belarus; it deprives us of a legal basis for structures like a formal human rights dialogue and addressing trade or energy transit issues."
"In the Commission, we continue to believe that the ratification of the PCA will be a useful step forward, but clearly we will continue to use this as an incentive lever to encourage further moves on the Belarusian side."
"Fourthly, and lastly, the Commission has started working on the implementation of the November 2009 GAERC conclusions, and will come back to the Council of EU Ministers with proposals as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received seven motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Thursday, 17 December 2009)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Democratic values and respect for human rights and individual freedoms provide the bedrock on which the EU has been built."
"As our basic objective is to help neighbouring countries become democratic and Belarus is one of the last countries in Europe with an authoritarian regime, I believe that we should set very clear, stringent political conditions for Belarus before any political contact is established."
"Belarus has carried out some reforms, but they pale into insignificance in relation to the problems which exist, especially with regard to respect for human rights, press freedom and freedom of expression."
"Support must be given to the activists campaigning for respect for human rights and individual freedoms."
"I support the idea of establishing contacts with the opposition and am particularly in favour of individual contacts between citizens from the EU and Belarus."
"As a result of this, the citizens from Belarus will be able to speak freely with people who share democratic values."
"This would contribute to the development of civil society and facilitate a process of democratisation, which would enjoy popular support and be initiated by the people itself."
"This is the only way that a healthy democracy can be created where everyone's rights are respected."
"Therefore, the use of sanctions as a means of exerting pressure needs to be combined with facilitating contacts between citizens from the EU and Belarus."
"I would like to welcome Belarus's constructive involvement in the Eastern Partnership process, as well as the fact that a human rights dialogue has been initiated between the EU and Belarus."
"During the past year, positive processes have been initiated in the country with the release of political prisoners, but we see that this process has since come to a standstill."
"This is due to problems with the registration of political parties and the authorisation of independent media and civil organisations."
"As a result, the EU was obliged to extend the travel restriction measures."
"I sincerely hope that Belarus will continue along the path of positive change it embarked on last year, thereby offering the opportunity for the EU also to be able to respond positively."
"Until then I think it is also important to consider whether we can move forward in the area of visa facilitation, as human contacts can make a major contribution to more political openness and the democratisation process as well."
"When debating respect for human rights in Belarus and the decision of Member States to extend sanctions against some representatives of the Belarusian regime until October 2010, it should be said that the situation in Belarus is gradually changing."
"In the outcome of the European Council of 17 November 2009, we read that new possibilities for dialogue and increasing cooperation between the European Union and Belarus have emerged."
"Wanting to encourage the authorities in Belarus to carry out reforms, the Member States agreed to a temporary lifting of sanctions on freedom of movement which had been applied to high-ranking representatives of the Belarusian authorities."
"The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for Belarusians to obtain EU visas and an agreement on readmission."
"However, we must not forget that human rights are still being violated in Belarus, and the promising and favourable steps taken since October 2008, such as the release of most political prisoners and the permission for distribution of two independent newspapers, are still not enough."
"A flagrant example of the violation of human rights is the continued use of the death penalty: Belarus is the only European country which still uses capital punishment, and in recent months, further death sentences have been passed."
"Therefore, we address the following demands to the decision makers in Belarus: that, at least, they respect human rights, including introduction of a moratorium on carrying out the death sentence, amendment of electoral law and guaranteeing freedom of speech and of the media."
"Violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Mr President, the Presidency attaches great importance to discussing with the European Parliament the highly problematic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Infringements of human rights, and particularly increased sexual and gender-related violence, are a huge problem."
"It is high time for a debate on the situation in the country, particularly in view of the recent UN report."
"The report from the UN group of experts emphasises that a number of armed groups active in the country are supported by a well-organised network that is partly based within the European Union."
"I do not need to remind you of the EU's long-term commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the entire African Great Lakes Region."
"The EU has long made efforts to bring about peace and stability in the country."
"It is important that this commitment continues, both politically and in terms of development."
"I am sure that the Commission will say more about this later."
"This support has been manifested in various ways, including the appointment of the first EU Special Representative for the region as far back as 1994."
"Both military and civil ESDP instruments have been used."
"We have had Operation Artemis in Ituri province, the temporary EUFOR deployment in the period leading up to the 2006 elections, as well as EUSEC RD Congo for reform of the defence forces and EUPOL RD Congo for reform of the police."
"Bearing all this in mind, there have been both positive and negative developments."
"Diplomatic relations between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have been restored."
"That is to be welcomed."
"Peace agreements with most of the armed groups in the eastern part of the country were signed in 2008 and 2009."
"These now have to be implemented."
"The situation is unstable in many ways."
"Many armed groups in the east are in the process of being integrated into the army and some uncertainty pervades this integration work."
"Military operations are continuing against other armed groups, including the FDLR and the Lord's Resistance Army."
"These groups are directly responsible for targeting civilians and for an enormous amount of human suffering."
"At the same time, armed groups are re-emerging in other parts of the country."
"The eastern part of the country remains an area in which international law and human rights are being infringed."
"There are high levels of murder, acts of violence and sexual attacks."
"These crimes are spreading throughout the country on an alarming scale, despite President Kabila's announcement of a so-called zero tolerance policy."
"The illegal exploitation of natural resources is a further major problem."
"It is important that the country's rich mineral deposits are brought under legitimate national control, both as a source of much-needed income for the state and in order to cut off economic support to illegal armed groups."
"The Council is also concerned about the preparatory work and arrangements for the planned local elections."
"Management problems, insufficient transparency and infringements of citizens' and political rights represent serious obstacles to the democratisation process."
"Since there are many significant problems that still provide cause for deep concern, the Council has taken a tough stance as regards the serious crimes against international law and human rights in North Kivu and South Kivu."
"The Council recently condemned these acts in its conclusions and emphasised that the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo must ensure that all those responsible are brought to justice."
"The EU is firmly committed to continuing to help bring about peace, stability and development for the population of the country."
"In this regard, reform of the security sector is crucial to the country's stabilisation."
"All players within this sector, including the Congolese authorities, must strive to ensure that the common interest in reform of the security sector is genuinely safeguarded."
"We must also encourage continued specific improvements in regional relations through firmer political and economic partnerships between the countries of the region."
"I can assure you that the Council and the European Union will stand by its commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo and is concerned about its future."
"We will continue our wide-ranging commitment in the country and will continue to speak plainly wherever international law and human rights are infringed."
"We are very grateful in this respect for the constructive and persistent role played by the European Parliament, and I am looking forward to hearing your views in this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year or so ago, the situation in Goma, a city besieged by the CNDP troops led by Laurent Nkunda, was the primary concern of the Congolese authorities and the international community."
"Every effort has been made to prevent the worst."
"Promoting a political agreement, firstly between the DRC and Rwanda, and then between the Congolese Government, the CNDP and the other armed groups has made it possible, in the short term, to defuse the ticking time bomb of violence, although its potential for destabilisation today remains intact."
"It remains intact because the underlying causes have been addressed superficially and on the basis of a short-term, purely political rationale."
"Being faced with only poor solutions, the international community has opted for the least serious one; that is not a criticism, just an obvious fact, an observation."
"The international community and the European Union have been unable to take the decision to deploy a protection force."
"The MONUC reinforcements that we have been requesting for over a year now are only just starting to arrive."
"The recent report by the United Nations group of independent experts and that by the Human Rights Watch organisation provide a damning account of the current situation that cannot be ignored or passed over in silence."
"It is time now to address and to deal with these underlying causes, and to come up with lasting solutions."
"If this is to be done, however, it will require everyone's cooperation - the cooperation of the Congolese and Rwandan governments in the first instance, and of MONUC, the United Nations, the rest of the international community and the European Union in the second instance."
"There is no doubt that the political and diplomatic rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC can be beneficial in terms of creating stability in the region and, if the will exists on both sides, can help establish a situation of peaceful coexistence and profitable cooperation between the two countries within a revitalised Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries."
"However, this is only the start of what remains a long and problematic journey."
"The FDLR issue is at the heart of the problem, as are all the associated sets of problems that it entails and which complicate the situation: the illegal exploitation of natural resources; the lack of protection for minorities; the impunity in a vast stateless area where the public authorities are not only incapable of controlling the territory but include representatives who are often part of the problem."
"The Rwanda-DRC agreement has meant that the CNDP and the unacceptable demands of Laurent Nkunda have been temporarily brought under control."
"The agreement has simply resulted in the replacement of Laurent Nkunda by Bosco Ntaganda, who is more easily influenced and willing to reach any compromise whatsoever in exchange for immunity, which is in violation of all the international provisions on crimes against humanity and which neither Rwanda nor the DRC are entitled or able to grant him."
"So far, the hasty integration of the CNDP into such an ineffective and totally chaotic army as the FARDC; the obtaining, by Bosco Ntaganda, of increased autonomous power resulting from the implementation of a parallel chain of command within the FARDC, for which the irregular payment of the soldiers and the absence of any form of discipline or hierarchy provides fertile ground; MONUC's insufficiently controlled and gauged support for the military operations against the FDLR; and the non-existent response to the demands of the Rwandophone minorities are factors that are liable to create even more serious problems than those which we faced a year ago - problems that neither Rwanda nor the DRC will be capable of managing any longer."
"The situation has scarcely improved against this backdrop: the humanitarian crisis continues without any obvious signs of improvement, as do the human rights violations, the sickening trend of violence, indeed of sexual atrocities, the impunity for all manner of crimes, and the pillaging of natural resources."
"One need only read the United Nations and the Human Rights Watch reports that I mentioned to understand the scale of this never-ending tragedy."
"It is clear that the actions aimed at preventing the FDLR from doing harm must continue, but not at any price, not without first having done everything it takes to minimise the risks that military pressure entails for innocent civilians."
"This requires better planning, the redefining of priorities and greater protection of the populations by MONUC, which is the main task stipulated in its mandate."
"The conditions in which MONUC may operate must also be clear and unambiguous."
"This is not about calling for MONUC to withdraw or disengage."
"A hasty withdrawal by MONUC would be disastrous, as it would create an even greater vacuum: the recent events in the Equator region, which are essentially one more symptom of the Congolese disease, prove this."
"Clearly, it is also important to stop the political and economic collusion from which the FDLR continue to benefit in the region and elsewhere in the world, including in our Member States."
"The FDLR's campaign is not a political campaign, but a criminal act of which the Congolese population is the main victim, and this is how the campaign and all those who are directly or indirectly associated with it must be treated."
"This is why a firmer stance is needed against all forms of trafficking."
"At the same time, beyond the disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) process, the Rwandan and Congolese authorities must be more perceptive with regard to individuals who are not necessarily criminals."
"That being said, the solution to a large part of the problem must also be found in the DRC."
"I am, of course, thinking of the local origins of the conflict."
"In this regard, the agreements of 23 March must be applied in full, otherwise, sooner or later, we will see the frustrations of the local populations gain the upper hand."
"This is absolutely essential if the stabilisation efforts and the will to revive economic activity in the Kivus are to succeed."
"At that point, the international community really will have a role to play."
"However, the Kivus aside, I am also thinking of the huge mess that the DRC has become over the last 20 years or so."
"It is a country in which practically everything needs to be rebuilt, starting with the state, the absence of which is at the heart of all the problems."
"In order to achieve this task, certain elements are crucial."
"Firstly, democracy must be consolidated."
"I am, of course, thinking of the local, legislative and presidential elections announced for 2011."
"Elections are one element of democracy, but we must not forget the need to continue to support the political institutions and forces in a dialectic relationship with the opposition."
"Without this, we would not be operating in a truly open political system."
"The second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance."
"While it is true that, given the extent of its problems, the DRC cannot do everything at once, it clearly must demonstrate a solid political will if it is to have a chance of success."
"Parliament raised the issue of impunity."
"This is a good example, because it is a matter of political will and it also underpins the whole business of affirming the rule of law."
"The problem is that things cannot be done in isolation."
"The rule of law also requires a reform of the security sector and real progress in economic governance terms."
"The scale of the challenges implies the need for long-term policies."
"However, that must not be an excuse for any lack of immediate action."
"I am thinking in particular of the issues of sexual violence and human rights, which Parliament has highlighted."
"Political will can play a crucial role here, and in this regard, we must welcome the commitment made by President Kabila to take a zero tolerance approach."
"This approach must now be applied."
"The Commission, which, by the way, is already doing a great deal of work in this area (supporting the judiciary, helping victims), is prepared to continue to support the DRC."
"In this connection I have also expressed my wish for the International Criminal Court and the Commission to cooperate more closely in practice with regard to the fight against sexual violence."
"A consolidated democratic system, good governance and political will: those are the key elements on which we would like to build our partnership as equals with the DRC."
"Mr President, practically every journalist who writes about Africa would like to be the next Joseph Conrad."
"This is why journalists most often concentrate on unfavourable aspects, because they are looking for the heart of darkness."
"However, Congo does not have to be a heart of darkness."
"It can be a normal country."
"There are normal countries in Africa, where rich natural resources serve the good of the people, the public authorities care for the common good, children go to school, and sex is associated with love and not rape and violence."
"I am certain that the key to success in Kivu and the whole of Congo is the quality of government."
"Without democratic, just, honest and effective government, peace and justice cannot be achieved."
"Without responsible government, the country's riches serve only a few, leaders look after themselves, schools are empty and violence becomes a part of everyday life."
"I remember the optimism of 2006."
"I, myself, was an observer during the elections, and we were all pleased because, after a gap of 40 years, democratic elections were taking place in that large and important country."
"However, our optimism has turned out to be premature."
"It is hard not to ask the question why this has happened, and why the elections did not result in a better life for Congo."
"In my opinion, it is a question of money, as Mrs Malmström and Mr De Gucht have said."
"They spoke about the illegal use of resources and how this is used to finance arms, which serves to continue and escalate the conflict."
"If we can put a stop to this, we will be closer to our goal."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement, which certainly reassures me."
"Can I say, Commissioner, that I agree with you absolutely: we cannot pull out; we cannot create a vacuum, because a vacuum exists there already and that is a vacuum of political will, and we need political leadership to resolve this according to international obligations as well as according to the rule of law."
"Let me just deal with the reality of this."
"In the conflict since 1998, over 5 000 400 people have lost their lives and, indirectly or directly, as many as 45 000 deaths occur every month."
"It is reported that there are 1 460 000 internally displaced people, most of them facing violence, and let me give a voice to those who do not have a voice, those who suffer such violence."
"The armed actors in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have perpetrated gender-based violence through various forms, including sexual slavery, kidnapping, forced recruitment, forced prostitution and rape."
"The Congolese victims of sexual violence include women, men and boys who have also suffered rape, sexual humiliation and genital mutilation."
"Resolution after resolution has been passed."
"The time has come for us internationally to demand an end to these atrocities."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have always kept a close eye on events taking place in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Despite the promising progress made thanks to the recent rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC - a rapprochement without which there will be no solution in the east and which must therefore be consolidated - despite the agreements of 23 March between Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel group, which the Commissioner spoke about, the situation in the east remains deeply concerning."
"I would like to make seven observations."
"The first is that peace certainly cannot be established in the east of Congo until the FDLR are prevented from doing harm."
"Unfortunately, the main victims of the military pressure that the DRC is exerting at present and which is aimed at cutting these extremists off from their bases and their sources of income are the civilian populations, who are victims of collateral damage but also of the condemnation of some and the violent acts of others."
"This risk was foreseeable and, as the Commissioner said, MONUC's capabilities needed to be strengthened from the outset, as today it is still sorely lacking in resources suitable for coping with all the requests and its organisation on the ground is also not always ideal."
"Even though we must demand a greater degree of coordination and a greater, more active presence on the ground, it would be dangerous to make judgments or comments about MONUC that could be used by certain negative forces as an excuse to demonise it."
"Clearly, that would be even more serious."
"Another element concerns the acts of violence by the FARDC."
"The context of war cannot, of course, in any way justify such behaviour, and thus, I welcome the decision taken by the United Nations to stop providing logistical support to those Congolese units that fail to respect human rights."
"The zero tolerance policy recently introduced by President Kabila clearly must be welcomed, but whether it is respected and implemented or not is another matter."
"The shortcomings of the Congolese judicial system are creating a widespread feeling of impunity."
"That is why I encourage the efforts made by the Commission, in close cooperation with certain EU Member States, to work on restoring a judicial system, including in the east."
"Lastly, my final point: the one thing that still has to be rebuilt in Congo is a rule of law with real governing powers."
"Today, these powers are completely non-existent and thus create an extremely serious vacuum."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, as you have both said, the situation in the Kivu region is extremely worrying, despite the presence of almost 20 000 MONUC troops."
"The civilian populations and, in particular, women, are the main victims of the conflict strategies employed by the armed groups and even, as someone said, by certain units of the Congolese army, which have made systematic rape a weapon of war."
"Moreover, last month, a group of Congolese women came here to remind us of this - and rightly so - with the aim of enlisting our support against this scandalous strategy."
"The pillaging of resources, as you said, Commissioner, is another factor that is exacerbating this conflict."
"I agree with what was said just now: it is highly dangerous to discredit MONUC, to discredit it unnecessarily, to make it solely responsible for the situation in the eyes of the populations, who are already worn out by so many years of war and massacres."
"I entirely agree that it is not MONUC's mandate that must be reviewed and that it should obviously not be asked to withdraw."
"What must be reviewed are its rules of engagement, its operational directives, so that it cannot in any way be associated with or support a Congolese unit that has men in its ranks who violate human rights or commit acts of violence."
"The Congolese authorities, too, have a big responsibility in this fight against impunity concerning acts of sexual violence, crimes which, I might add, should be brought before the International Criminal Court."
"These same authorities must also ensure that the soldiers are quartered in barracks immediately."
"If they were quartered in barracks, things would no doubt be different."
"Lastly, I believe that we must revisit the Amani programme."
"This programme offers the possibility of building a dialogue and peace everywhere, since these alone are the guarantees of lasting reconstruction."
"In any case, I welcome your intervention, which I broadly support, and I hope that the European Union will remain active."
"This is crucial, even though, regrettably, it did not want to put a force together."
"That would have been a possibility a little less than a year ago."
"Nevertheless, I believe that European Union action is crucial."
"Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended."
"Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children?"
"The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled - atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved."
"So what is being defended in the Congo?"
"Humanity?"
"Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people?"
"President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms."
"This change was suspended when the war escalated once again."
"My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo - the FDLR - reputed to be in Germany?"
"I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"(DE) Mr President, the expulsion of millions of people, thousands of rapes and hundreds of murders must not be the sad legacy of the largest UN peace-keeping operation in the world."
"The Congo operation was decided on ten years ago, but nothing much has been achieved."
"Militias continue to plunder the rich supply of natural resources in the region, terrorise the inhabitants and commit crimes against humanity."
"Embargoes have been ineffective so far."
"Rebels are simply changing sides and they carry out their crimes in the safe uniforms of Congolese soldiers."
"Two war criminals were recently brought before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague and development projects and elections were able to take place - a partial success, at least."
"We also succeeded in striking a small blow against the global Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR)."
"However, we have not been able to put an end to the cruel civil war."
"The fronts are always changing."
"It is particularly disturbing when accusations made against the UN mission turn out to be true."
"UN soldiers must not stand there and do nothing when atrocities are being committed and, even more importantly, the army's logistics support must not be associated with support for human rights violations."
"The Congo mission simply must not turn into some kind of Vietnam for Europe."
"Essentially, we need a coordinated European security policy and peace-keeping operations, but above all, in the area surrounding Europe and not in far-off Africa, where the ethnic fronts are unclear."
"In my opinion, the EU must concentrate its peace-keeping operations on the crisis regions in its own backyard, such as the Balkans or the Caucasus."
"Therefore, we should, perhaps, end the EU's involvement in the UN mission in Africa."
"Mr President, that the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is deplorable and that the effect of the conflict upon the people there is tragic goes without saying."
"However, there are a number of important points that must be reiterated here and in our joint motion for a resolution."
"We must remember that the violence in the DRC, like so many conflicts of its type, is often driven by greed but also stems from and is fuelled by poverty."
"Fighting over territory, ethnicity, resources or politics are but branches of the same rotten tree of want."
"Increase a man's prosperity and give him purpose and you will reduce his desire to kill or be killed."
"That is our development challenge as a Parliament."
"Secondly, we must ensure that any military presence in a foreign country is designed and implemented to reduce suffering and violence, not exacerbate it."
"We must stand as pillars against impunity rather than agents of it."
"If there is evidence that Western missions are not living up to this standard, then their presence and practices must be urgently reassessed."
"Finally, history has shown us that, in internecine conflicts such as in the DRC, a political solution is the only hope for peace."
"Dialogue and engagement are the only roads toward such a solution."
"With the post-Lisbon creation of our External Action Service, the European Union must take its place on the international stage as a more proactive facilitator of dialogue and a sponsor of peace."
"(RO) As has been emphasised so far, millions of civilians have been deliberately killed during military operations in the eastern part of the Republic of Congo."
"There is a risk of this kind of news becoming quite routine due to the unprecedented frequency with which acts of violence are committed in this country."
"The victims of these actions include children, young girls and women, not to mention civilians involved in protecting human rights and journalists."
"The humanitarian crisis is deepening with every day that passes."
"The lack of security in the area means that humanitarian organisations can no longer provide any intervention."
"More than 7 500 cases of rape and sexual violence have been recorded in the first nine months of this year alone, which is more than the figure for the whole of last year."
"All these incidents have taken place against a backdrop of famine and extreme poverty affecting millions of people."
"The blame for this whole tragedy lies both with the Congolese army and Rwandan rebels."
"Unfortunately, however, there are indications that the UN troops in the Congo bear a large share of the responsibility as they are allowing serious violations of human rights to take place."
"This is why I believe that the European Union must discuss urgently how the UN forces in the Congo are going to achieve properly the mission objectives that have been assigned them."
"Measures are also required to put an end to money-laundering activities, arms trafficking and gold trafficking, which results in more than 37 tonnes of gold being illegally removed from the Congo every year, with a value in excess of EUR 1 billion."
"The money from this is used to procure weapons and encourage crime in this country."
"(NL) Mr President, I have just listened to the speech by Mr Mölzer, who has now left, the gist of which was: it is so hopeless that we should just give up and concentrate on our own neighbours."
"I must say that, if one really looks at the situation, one is almost tempted to call it a day."
"On the other hand, I then think of the group of women who visited us here last month, to whom Mrs Durant also referred, and I wonder whether we could look them in the eye and tell them that we are simply giving up, or that it is not one of our priorities, or that we mean to just adopt yet another resolution and consider our job done."
"When I think of those women, of their despair and bitterness and the feeling that they have been left in the lurch, I do consider it eminently possible to hold such a debate."
"The resolution contains very many positive elements, and I hope that we shall indeed lend force to them with action, but I just wanted to emphasise one aspect."
"We frequently talk about rape, or sexual violence, but in fact, these terms scarcely cover the reality of the situation."
"The women with whom we spoke said it goes far beyond attacks on individuals; it is not individual violence but rather an attack on the community, aimed at destroying its fabric."
"It is my view, therefore, that there is now a most urgent need for us not only to take action, put an end to impunity, pay on the nail and provide the resources for the actions we have announced, but also to show that we are extending a hand to the people there, that we stand in solidarity with them and are not leaving them in the lurch; that we are shouldering our moral responsibility."
"(RO) At the present juncture, which also coincides with the moment when the United Nations is preparing to announce the extension of MONUC's mandate, I think we need to reflect on the international community's actions in light of the situation on the ground in the RDC, which is, unfortunately, continuing to deteriorate."
"As is also borne out by the experience of Operation Kimia II conducted by the Congolese army with MONUC's support, military success is not sufficient when the cost in humanitarian terms is high and if it is paid through the suffering of the Congolese civilian population."
"I believe that the recent military operations conducted against the FDLR have had disastrous consequences, resulting, which we should be aware of, in large-scale human rights violations and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis."
"On the other hand, impunity offers an invitation to commit these crimes over and over again."
"I believe that protection of the civilian population must be the number one priority."
"The European Parliament must strongly assert that acts of violence, particularly sexual violence, and human rights violations in general, as well as the abuses committed in Kivu, must stop immediately, along with the climate of impunity."
"(ES) Mr President, other Members have already spoken of the tragic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"They have spoken of the millions of deaths and cases of rape and abuse against the civilian population."
"They have spoken of the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and of cooperation by the European Commission on the ground."
"Less has been said, however, about the need to control the illegal flow of raw materials, such as diamonds, gold and other products, to the rest of the world."
"These products are being 'laundered' through legitimate accounts and companies in our own countries or in the United States."
"This is important work for Mrs Ashton."
"With the authority conferred on her by the Treaty of Lisbon and the support of the 27 Member States and of this Parliament, she could coordinate a whole programme of action to prevent this wealth from ending up in the hands of the warlords who are responsible for the killing and rape."
"(FR) Mr President, in the light of the recent alarming reports coming out of North and South Kivu, and in the light of the extremely violent nature of the attacks perpetrated against civilians and, more specifically, against women, children and the elderly, urgency - a word so often used by the European Union and by the entire international community with regard to Congo - seems to me to be an immediate requirement."
"Everything must be done to ensure the protection of the civilian populations."
"The mandate given to the MONUC personnel on the ground will no doubt be extended, but it absolutely must be re-evaluated and strengthened, too, so that this rising tide of violence can be stemmed."
"For many years now, international communities, NGOs and Congolese women have made constant efforts to combat the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war."
"Today, systematic and widespread use is made of this weapon in peaceful areas, and always with total impunity."
"I welcome the recent determination shown by the Congolese authorities to put a stop to this impunity, but this zero tolerance policy must be ambitious - all perpetrators of violence, without exception, will have to answer for their actions - and truly effective."
"The opening, at the International Criminal Court, of the first trials of the alleged perpetrators of sexual crimes committed during an armed conflict must result in the Court being able to identify all the culprits so that they can be sentenced without delay."
"Lastly, all this, needless to say, goes hand in hand with the strengthening of state structures, the maintenance of law and order, the promotion of gender equality, and the protection of human rights and, hence, of the rights of women and children, whose dignity, childhood and innocence are often sacrificed on the altar of another form of humiliation: indifference."
"(FR) Mr President, the humanitarian situation in the east of the Republic of Congo - and, more specifically, in the eastern province and in the Kivu region - is disastrous, as we now know."
"The security situation of the civilian populations deteriorated following, among other things, the joint military operations conducted by the Congolese army and the Ugandan and Rwandan troops against all the rebel armed groups, operations which left countless massacres and human rights violations in their wake."
"Sexual violence is a very disturbing and very widespread trend, and is now part of everyday life for the people of Congo."
"What is more, numerous acts of violence are being committed against humanitarian workers."
"According to official figures, there are 2 113 000 displaced persons in the east of the Republic of Congo."
"Since 1 January 2009, more than 775 000 new cases of displaced persons have been recorded in the Kivu and 165 000 in the districts of the east of the eastern province."
"Currently, it is estimated that humanitarian aid is required for almost 350 000 vulnerable people: children, widows and victims of sexual violence."
"A rapid response by the European Union is therefore crucial."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the speakers have rightly emphasised the terrible situation in which the Congolese people, and especially Congolese women, are living in the east of that country."
"They have talked about the rapes and the barbaric acts that these people suffer and about the murders of which they are victims."
"Rather than talk about them, however, I invite you to visit the UNICEF and V-Day websites, which obviously say all there is to say about this subject."
"Today, I am going to talk to you about the real consequences that these barbaric acts have for Congo;"
"I am going to talk about the physically and mentally wounded women, who must be cared for; and I am going to talk about the murdered women, who will no longer be able to contribute to the economic development of Congo and whose unborn children will never be able to contribute to it either."
"I would also like to talk about the spread of AIDS, a trauma suffered by the entire Congolese population, which paints a negative picture of Congo to the international community - one, in short, of a country that is getting into more and more of a mess."
"Encouraging a lasting peace and promoting the economic development of Congo are only achievable if the Congolese Government and the UN are successful in their efforts to combat sexual violence against Congolese women and, more broadly speaking, if they ensure that a genuine rule of law is established in that country."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I, in turn, would like to refer to the tragedy of the sexual violence suffered by women in the DRC and, more specifically, in the east of the country."
"The phenomenon is not new."
"It is extremely complex."
"It is multidimensional."
"The physical and psychological suffering of the victims is made even worse by this social exclusion, which is tragic for them."
"President Kabila's zero tolerance policy is today tentatively beginning to bear fruit, but everyone is aware that only a global strategy can combat this scourge in the long term."
"I know, Commissioner, that the Commission is already intervening, and is doing so via a multitude of projects and budgets, too."
"However, faced with these figures and with the terrible, dreadful accounts we are hearing, do you not think that we in this House are entitled to have our doubts about the results of this strategy?"
"Women, Commissioner, are the main vehicle for peace and reconstruction in a country."
"They are the future of Congo."
"How do you intend to act more effectively and more promptly?"
"(FR) Mr President, I, too, wished to speak in this debate, since it concerns a subject that I have been following for a long time."
"Unfortunately, in the light of the constant acts of violence and the human rights violations in the east of the DRC, we are obliged once again to strongly condemn the massacres, the crimes against humanity and the acts of sexual violence committed against women and girls that are still taking place in the eastern province."
"That is why I join with my fellow Members in calling for all the competent authorities to intervene immediately in order to bring the perpetrators of these crimes before the courts and in calling on the United Nations Security Council once again to urgently take any measures that have the capacity to actually prevent anyone else from committing further attacks against the civilian populations in the eastern province of the DRC."
"Similarly, I call on all the parties involved to step up the fight against impunity and to enforce the rule of law by combating, among other things, the rape of women and girls and the enlistment of child soldiers."
"(DE) Mr President, in November 2009, there was an exchange of ambassadors between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo - a tiny ray of hope for this ravaged country and its ravaged people."
"In addition, the leader of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda was arrested."
"These are both signs of improvement in the situation in eastern Congo."
"My question for the Commission is this: what measures are you intending to take to bring about further rapprochement between Congo and Rwanda?"
"With regard to the UN mandate, a great deal has been said here today about taking all forms of action."
"Let us be frank: if there is a UN mandate, then it should clearly be for the protection of those who are oppressed, tortured, violated and abused, in particular, the women and children of this country."
"In this regard, one thing must be quite clear: if a UN mandate is issued - and we Austrians are a bit restrictive in this area - then it should be consistent and, if need be - including for the protection of the oppressed people - those on the ground must be armed."
"Mr President, I think it is unfortunate that in this Christmas season, we have spent the last two days discussing violence around the world, be it in Chechnya or in Afghanistan and now in the Congo."
"But, nevertheless, that is the reality."
"At the same time, taking the message of the festive season of peace and goodwill, we must, as my colleague Mr Mitchell put it so well, become sponsors of peace."
"And this is a great opportunity for the High Representative, Lady Ashton, to use the power and support of the European Union in a way that could not have been done before, to bring these countries to order and to try and alleviate the terrible suffering in these places."
"The long-term solution, though, will come not from economic improvement but from education, and we have to try and ensure free access to proper education in these countries, because that is really the way to peace in the long term."
"Mr President, in 1960, the Swedish Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, asked the Irish troops to go as peacemakers into what was then the Belgian Congo, which became the Congo."
"They did a tremendous job."
"I am extremely worried about the role of the United Nations troops in the Congo at present: the Moroccans, the Pakistanis and the Indians."
"We are talking about rape, violence, trading and so on, but the United Nations troops there are not covering themselves in glory and are actually doing a disservice."
"I agree completely with Mr Mitchell, that the European Union needs to take a firmer hand."
"We are a European Union, totally united."
"We did excellent work in Chad."
"We need our own peacekeepers in there and we cannot rely on the United Nations."
"The situation is that we have a beautiful people, victims of European colonisation, victims of tribal conflict, victims of international blindness, and we cannot be blind any longer."
"We simply have to go in and save those people."
"(SV) Mr President, it is almost impossible to grasp the terrible statistics being mentioned, and yet we know that they are true."
"Nonetheless, there is a feeling - perhaps shared by many - that when it comes to the poorest of poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa, our commitment is not as strong or as specific as it should be."
"There has been mention of military power."
"I think we all realise that we have to fight poverty and corruption if we are to make any progress towards relieving and improving the situation of this country's population, which has suffered so appallingly."
"We are happy to talk about Afghanistan and spend a lot of time discussing the terror there and what the Taliban are doing, and rightly so."
"Here is another people, however, who have suffered and are still suffering the most appalling conditions."
"I would like to stress that there are non-governmental organisations which can carry out work if they are provided with state support and with EU support, but that often seems to be very difficult to bring about."
"Mr President, as this debate has shown, there are incredibly good reasons for continuing our commitment to the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The EU is already highly committed to achieving long-term stability, security and development in the country."
"Commissioner De Gucht gave a long account of the EU's operations."
"Taken together, the contributions of the Member States and the Commission make the EU one of the largest contributors of aid to the region, and therefore we can have an influence."
"If stability is to be maintained in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the region, however, it is crucial that the standard of living of the Congolese population is improved, that human rights are safeguarded, and that vigorous action is taken against corruption in order to establish a society based on the principles of the rule of law."
"The appalling sexual violence that many Members have borne testimony to here and that we unfortunately hear about in far too many reports is naturally entirely unacceptable."
"The perpetrators must not be allowed to go free."
"They must be brought to justice."
"The Congolese Government has a great responsibility to ensure that this happens and that President Kabila's zero tolerance policy does not just consist of fine words but actually results in action."
"As far as the Council is concerned, the mandate of the two ESDP missions was reviewed following the investigation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo in early 2009 with a view to helping to combat precisely this kind of sexual violence."
"As a result, EUPOL DR Congo is to send two multidisciplinary teams to the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, with a mandate covering the entire country."
"These teams will provide various types of specialist expertise in areas such as the investigation of crimes and the control of sexual violence."
"Recruitment for these missions is currently under way."
"Of course, this is only a small contribution."
"In such a large country, it is modest."
"Nonetheless, it is important and this new specialist force will be able to support the implementation of correct investigation procedures for sexual violence, particularly where the acts are carried out by those in uniform."
"We are about to embark upon question time, but this is my final debate in this House as a representative of the Swedish Presidency."
"I would like to thank you for the many good debates, the enjoyable times and the very good cooperation that I have enjoyed with the Members of the European Parliament and with you, Mr President."
"I too would like to express, on behalf of all my fellow Members, our sincere thanks for your efficiency and your efforts which gave us all so much pleasure."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate."
"I am not going to revert back to my initial statement."
"Let me just focus on three things."
"First, the European Commission is doing a lot with respect to humanitarian aid and programmes for re-establishing the rule of law."
"We are speaking about tens of millions and even more than EUR 100 million initially."
"But the problem is, of course, how effective is all this in the end, if you do not have a proper counterpart in the political arena?"
"Secondly, I would like to comment on the mandate of MONUC because, although MONUC may be criticised and has to be criticised for what recently happened, I think it would be the ultimate mistake to ask that they leave the DRC."
"This would be the worst thing one could imagine."
"Let me just read to you some sections of the mandate adopted by the UN Security Council at the beginning of last year."
"It states that 'the Council also decided that MONUC shall, from the adoption of this resolution, have the mandate, in this order of priority, working in close cooperation with the Government of the DRC in order to ensure, firstly, the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel and facilities; to ensure the protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel, under imminent threat of physical violence, in particular, violence emanating from any of the parties engaged in the conflict'."
"Another very relevant paragraph is paragraph G regarding the coordinated operations."
"It states 'coordinate operations with the FARDC - the army - integrated brigades deployed in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and support operations led by and jointly planned with these brigades in accordance with international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law with a view to', etc."
"So the mandate is, in fact, very clear and what should be discussed are the rules of engagement."
"In fact, what MONUC should do is look at its own rules of engagement, because it is up to them to decide how they will proceed."
"Lastly, there is a lot of criticism also of international criminal justice."
"People are questioning whether this is compatible with politics."
"Can you have international criminal justice, on the one hand, and proper political management of a crisis, on the other?"
"That is a very interesting question."
"In the Congo, you see one of the answers."
"We have allowed Bosco Ntaganda to take over the leadership of the CNDP from Laurent Nkunda, although there is a warrant against Bosco Ntaganda, and you see what happens."
"There is no such thing as a free lunch."
"You cannot choose between, on the one hand, management of a political crisis and, on the other hand, putting international criminal justice into practice."
"I think that, as the European Parliament and as the European Commission, the pre-eminence should go to the due application of international criminal justice."
"I have received six motions for resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 December 2009."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0236/2009)"
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Ethnic minorities in Serbia"
"How would the Council assess the situation of the ethnic minorities in Serbia, especially the Albanian community in the Preševo Valley, where civilians have again come under attack?"
"Thank you for your question, Mr Posselt."
"At the General Affairs Council meeting on 7-8 December this year, we adopted conclusions on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process."
"In these conclusions, the Council welcomed Serbia's commitment to EU integration and its work in implementing key reforms in line with European standards."
"The Council also stressed that the reform agenda must be continued."
"We noted the Commission's communication of 14 October, which states that the general legal and institutional framework for respecting human rights is in place in Serbia and that progress has been made as regards improving compliance with international human rights legislation."
"The new Ministry of Human and Minority Rights in Serbia is playing an important part in this work."
"However, further efforts are needed to increase understanding of international standards."
"The Council also noted that Serbia has ratified all the major human rights instruments."
"With regard to the specific situation in southern Serbia to which the honourable Member referred, some very violent incidents did indeed take place in July, including an attack on the gendarmerie based there."
"Several arrests were made, after which there were no more incidents."
"The atmosphere within the Coordination Body for Southern Serbia has since improved."
"It is fragile, but the main ethnic Albanian political parties from the region are involved in this work."
"There are also positive developments with regard to the sensitive issue of education."
"In this regard, I would particularly like to mention the opening of a university department in Medveđa, where teaching will be undertaken in Serbian and Albanian."
"A national minority council for the Albanian population of Serbia will be set up in the near future."
"This will give the people greater influence on education, culture and other issues."
"The region's weak economic and social development presents an obstacle for the ethnic minorities in southern Serbia."
"The international community, and the OSCE in particular, is continuing to monitor the situation in southern Serbia and it is playing an active role in promoting peace and stability in the region in close cooperation with the Serbian Government and local leaders."
"(DE) Mrs Malmström, thank you for your excellent reply."
"We are, of course, talking about three regions: two border regions - Vojvodina and the southern Serbian region of Preševo, in other words a tri-border area."
"I would also like to ask you, in your future role as Commissioner, to ensure that these countries are developed further within the framework of the cross-border support programme."
"Inner Serbia, in particular the Sandžak of Novi Pazar, is, of course, completely cut off."
"This area must also be supported in order to improve the economic conditions so as to help resolve the problems in relation to the minorities."
"However, there is a great deal of violence in southern Serbia in particular."
"I would ask the Council to continue to address this explosive situation."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr Posselt, you may be assured that we will continue to survey the situation very closely, and that is also part of the Commission's constant work."
"They will do that, of course."
"We are aware of the improvements, and the situation is fragile."
"But there are improvements, and these institutional arrangements that I refer to, that have been done, are a good step in the right direction."
"We can only hope that, with our support as well as the support from OSCE, this development will continue in that direction."
"(DE) Violence, incidentally - and I say this to the previous speaker - is unfortunately not only occurring in Serbia, but in Kosovo, too."
"On the one hand, there is an Albanian minority in Serbia and, on the other, there is a Serbian minority in Kosovo."
"My question is this: with regard to the visa facilitation for Serbia, how will the EU ensure that there will be no grey areas and no abuses of the system?"
"Does this procedure of granting facilitation to one population group in Kosovo not run counter to the controversial recognition of Kosovo as a sovereign state?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I was not exactly sure about the question."
"When it comes to Kosovo, there is further work, independent of the fact that not all Member States have recognised Kosovo."
"There is work being conducted by the Commission in order to see how we can facilitate the situation for Kosovo, and that will take some time."
"There are still difficulties there."
"They are also subject to visa facilitation in the future but not all the conditions have been met yet."
"It is clear that it did wander off the subject a little, but it was very much related."
"Subject: Unemployment levels"
"What initiatives has the Council put in place to deal with rising levels of unemployment across the EU-27, other than measures to retrain and upskill workers?"
"Thank you for your question, Mrs Harkin."
"The present crisis is having a very severe impact on millions of people."
"As a result, dealing with the consequences of the economic crisis is one of the major challenges facing the EU."
"In view of our ageing population, the Member States of the EU must bring down current levels of unemployment and ensure these high levels of unemployment do not become permanent."
"Employment policy is primarily the responsibility of the Member States."
"However, some years ago, certain guidelines were adopted by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council."
"We underlined the fact that since the labour market situation varies so much between different Member States, the measures taken must also differ."
"We have an annual joint report on employment, in which the Council and the Commission monitor the situation in the various Member States."
"During the current crisis, the European Council has paid particular attention to precisely this issue of unemployment."
"In December 2008, an Economic Recovery Plan was agreed for Europe, providing uniform frameworks for the measures to be taken."
"As part of this Plan, in June 2009, the Council and the European Parliament adopted a Regulation amending the Regulation on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"This amendment allows resources from the fund to be used to combat the crisis."
"Various measures may be implemented, depending on the situation of the country concerned: temporary adjustment of working hours, lowering of social security contributions, reducing the administrative burden on enterprises, improving the processes used by the labour market authorities, targeting measures at unemployed young people and facilitating mobility."
"These were highlighted in the Presidency's report following the informal summit on employment."
"In its conclusions from the June summit, the Council specifies a number of measures that should help the Member States - and the parties in the labour market if necessary - to deal with the effects of the global crisis through the application of flexicurity principles."
"This may mean offering enterprises alternatives to redundancies, giving opportunities for flexible forms of working and temporary adjustment of working hours, improving conditions for entrepreneurs by providing a flexible, secure labour market and making available benefits systems that provide an incentive to work, appropriate levels of social security contributions, expanded and improved back-to-work measures, income support and free movement."
"During the debate in November, the ministers took the general view that an active employment policy that includes short-term measures must be maintained."
"These are measures such as short-term employment, improved employability and training aimed at integrating people into the labour market."
"At the same Council meeting, ministers agreed that employment is an important factor for the avoidance of exclusion."
"The link between equality, economic growth and employment is very important, and consequently, the Member States were called upon to expand child care and to reduce pay differentials and other gender-related differences."
"In particular, measures must be targeted at those most severely affected by the crisis: older people, young people, people with disabilities and workers without a permanent employment contract."
"Creating more opportunities and equal opportunities for young people in education, training and employment is one of the principal aims of the new framework of European cooperation in the youth field during the period 2010-2018 that was adopted by the Council on 27 November 2009."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I must say I am delighted to see you, Minister, and hopefully will be seeing more of you next year; you will be well used to answering our questions."
"Two points which I feel are important but which you did not raise in your answer were: first of all, the encouraging of entrepreneurship: and, secondly, increased spending in R&D. But the real question which I want to ask you related to the fact that up to now, we have relied on the open method of coordination, which was really quite a weak instrument and did not work well in trying to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Have you any suggestions at all for strengthening that mechanism?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - This is, indeed, a very important question and, as you know, the Council has already received the Commission proposal and has started to discuss the future of the Lisbon strategy or Europe 2020."
"That will be decided by the Spanish Presidency later next spring."
"One issue is how do we, on a long-term basis, come out of the current situation?"
"How can we create a Europe that is more competitive, with more entrepreneurship, and avoid social exclusion and unemployment?"
"How do we invest in research and development in order for Europe to be the strong global player that we want it to be in the economic field?"
"All that will possibly fit into the new strategy."
"One very important aspect of the strategy is the governance method."
"I think the open method of coordination has advantages but it needs to be improved."
"We need to involve much more local and regional authorities because they are the ones who do the real implementation."
"We need to have national ownership of the process and we need to look at governance."
"That is also explained in the paper from the Commission, which is now out for consultation among the Member States."
"I think very good proposals will come up for that as it is indeed one of the weak points of the strategy."
"(DE) As we know, the so-called micro-financing instrument planned by the EU is not going to be financed by new money, but from the Progress programme."
"In this connection, what plan is there to prevent the new instrument from being detrimental to the employment and social solidarity programme, which was adopted before this one?"
"(DE) My question is this: would it not be sensible to prevent unemployment in the first place?"
"Do you see any public jobs that could be given to the unemployed?"
"In particular, how could we boost small and medium-sized enterprises so that new ones are started up?"
"Are there opportunities here to apply cross-border methods and best practices to create more new companies?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - As I said, the ultimate responsibility to create jobs of course lies with the Member States. But there is a lot to do and - as I referred to in my introductory remarks to Mrs Harkin - the Council has made a lot of recommendations regarding how you could work in increasing the flexibility, work with the different support systems and activate people in order to avoid the exclusion mechanism."
"It is very important that we continue with these meetings at a high level with the social partners and the Member States in order to exchange best practices."
"They do vary between the countries, but we need to give each other examples and to monitor the best ways that could be used thereafter."
"So it is a combination of the Council giving recommendations and the Member States needing to take their share of responsibility and adjust a little, depending on the circumstances in the countries."
"Referring to your question, sir, I am not really sure that I understood it."
"Maybe there was a translation problem."
"I did not refer to any micro-authority."
"I referred to the Globalisation Fund which we have now, with the help of the European Parliament, made more flexible in order to obtain support for Member States and for companies who run into difficulties to help with people who are unemployed or who are dismissed."
"Subject: Negotiations for Turkey to take part in joint Frontex operations"
"On 21 October 2009, Ms Malmstöm, President-in-Office of the Council, told the European Parliament meeting in plenary sitting that negotiations were being held 'with a view to a possible agreement which would also cover exchanges of information and the possibility for the Turkish authorities to take part in joint Frontex operations.'"
"Article 8e, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EC) No 863/2007establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 provides that 'any amendments to or adaptations of the operational plan shall require the agreement of both the Executive Director and the requesting Member State.'"
"In view of the above, will the Council say what stage discussions for Turkish participation in joint Frontex operations have reached?"
"What demands is Turkey making as a condition for its participation?"
"Is Greece, a Member State which hosts the Frontex mission, aware of these discussions?"
"An important element of the EU's strategy for better management of migration is to establish partnerships with third countries on matters of border control."
"This is a central tenet of the concept of integrated border management that was adopted by the Council in December 2006."
"I would also like to mention that operational cooperation with third countries is an important element of the work carried on by Frontex."
"Under the terms of the Frontex Regulation, Frontex may facilitate operational cooperation between Member States and third countries within the framework of the European Union's policy on external relations and may cooperate with third countries within the context of bilateral cooperation."
"A number of such arrangements have already been concluded and others are currently under discussion."
"The mandate for the negotiations is given by the Management Board, on which all the Member States are represented."
"The discussions being conducted between Frontex and the competent Turkish authorities concerning operational cooperation have now made significant progress."
"Since the negotiations are still in progress, it is difficult for the Council to comment in more detail on the content of and developments in the discussions."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, I understand from your reply today that there are three points: firstly, that negotiations between Frontex and Turkey are at an advanced stage; secondly, that all the Member States of the European Union, hence including Greece, are - I imagine - aware of the negotiations; and finally that, according to the conclusions of the recent Foreign Ministers meeting, the readmission agreement is linked to border control."
"In other words, for the purpose of cooperation, for the purpose of the readmission agreement with the European Union, is Turkey demanding joint operations with external border control?"
"If that is the case, how do we get round the serious issue of protection of the human rights and dignity of immigrants and the highly sensitive issue, not so much of border control, but rather of border definition."
"In other words, does Turkey accept the external borders of the European Union?"
"Does it accept that Frontex is acting on the external borders of the European Union?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - This is, of course, a very vast question."
"Negotiations with Turkey have just started."
"The representative from the Commission, Commissioner Barrot, and Mr Billström, the Swedish Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy, were in Turkey just a few weeks ago in order to start those discussions."
"The first discussions were fruitful but they have not yet reached an end so it is very difficult to give you an update."
"All Member States, including Greece, are of course kept informed of the discussions."
"In general, the respect for fundamental rights and European values are always mentioned in this regard so there is no exclusion for Turkey in that respect."
"But, as I said to the honourable Member, discussions have just started; they are making good progress but they have not been finalised yet."
"They have been carried out openly in the way that all Member States are involved via the board of Frontex, where Greece is also represented."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, from what I have understood, the understanding we have entered into with Turkey in the aim of ultimately arriving at a readmission agreement on immigration issues will also include issues in connection with cooperation with Frontex."
"The second thing I want to say is that we have noticed in Greece recently that Frontex aircraft are being harassed by the Turkish authorities."
"The Commission's replies say nothing specific about the communications which take place and whether this ultimately constitutes harassment."
"Do you have any comment on this?"
"(DE) In order to master the situation, it is certainly sensible to cooperate at an international level if - and I say this very clearly - this cooperation does not need to be bought with EU financial assistance."
"With which other States are we currently negotiating or planning to negotiate and was the Turkish State offered financial incentives for its participation in this FRONTEX operation?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Vessels have been the subject of questions during Question Time on numerous occasions."
"The Council has informed the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Government and its representatives that good cooperation in the region is a prerequisite for further discussions on this."
"It has also asked the Turkish authorities to refrain from different provocative actions."
"It has been very clear, and you can find those answers, some of which have been given by myself very recently."
"Discussions are ongoing."
"They have been mandated."
"As I said, I cannot tell you exactly at what stage they are because they are ongoing, but they follow the usual procedure and, to answer your question, we are also having discussions with Senegal and Cape Verde."
"We have started, but have made very little progress, with Morocco, Egypt and Mauritania."
"This is the usual procedure."
"They are being followed."
"The Frontex board has been mandated to start those negotiations."
"Some are more successful than others."
"We have, for instance, cooperation with Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, etc., but less progress has been made in other areas."
"Subject: Climate negotiations in Copenhagen"
"Can the Council give an update on the negotiations nearing conclusion in Copenhagen?"
"Can it specify, in the absence of a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, when it expects a legally binding successor to Kyoto to be in place?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Developments are ongoing as we speak in Copenhagen, but I will try to give you the latest."
"They are two major issues as you are well aware: mitigation and financing."
"As the Prime Minister said this morning, we are still confident that we can have a successful outcome in Copenhagen which allows us to keep the global temperature increase below 2 oC above the pre-industrial level."
"The EU is playing a key role - a bridge-building role - in a process with a view to ultimately reaching a legally binding agreement: hopefully, a politically binding agreement now, with a clear timetable to reach a legally binding agreement for the period starting 1 January 2013."
"But reaching an agreement requires convergence on the following essential building blocks."
"Firstly, deep and ambitious emission reduction commitments by the developed countries by 2020."
"Some countries, Japan and Norway, have upped their pledges but it is clear that what is currently on the table is not enough to reach the 2 °C target."
"In this context, the EU will reiterate its demands to other developed countries to take on an ambitious agenda, and to continue to seek measurable, reportable and verifiable mitigation actions by developing countries."
"The larger developing countries have put their bids to limit their growth of emissions on the table - China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and South Korea - and this accounts for significant contributions."
"However, the Council believes that there is a larger potential for actions to come from these countries, especially China and India."
"It is also clear that more is needed if we want to stay within the 2 °C warming."
"The EU will therefore ask them to increase their efforts further in the context of an ambitious agreement."
"We also need a framework for adapting to climate changes as well as for technology transfer and capacity building."
"We need financing in the framework of a fair and equitable governance system for mitigation, adaptation, capacity building and technology transfer to developing countries."
"In this context, the last European Council concerning the figure for fast-start financing for the first three years gives an important impetus to the ongoing negotiations; that also strengthens the credibility of the European Union."
"Heads of State or Government are now approaching Copenhagen."
"We hope that they will provide the necessary political impetus on the crucial issues of mitigation and financing."
"So hopefully, an ambitious deal can be struck."
"The EU has put forward proposals that the negotiation for a legally binding treaty for the period starting 1 January 2013 should be finalised as soon as possible after the Copenhagen conference."
"When this can be achieved is too early to say, but we should aim for a deal within six months after the finalisation of the conference."
"I would like to thank you, Mrs Malmström, for your concise, precise and logical response, not just to my question but to all questions since I came here to this Parliament last June."
"You have been a star performer."
"I am also proud to say that I am part of a European Union that is leading the climate change debate and influencing others to do the same."
"I suppose the best example of that is the arrival today in Copenhagen of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of China, something unthinkable a few years ago."
"However, in the absence of a binding agreement, what would our modus operandi be going forward?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I think, as the real political negotiations will start tomorrow with, as you say, Prime Ministers and Presidents coming from all over the world, we should not talk about a Plan 'B' already."
"I think they can assert the input, strength and dynamics to create an ambitious, political commitment."
"Should it not be possible to reach it - well, we will just have to continue to talk."
"There is no way we will give up."
"The world is expecting results from us."
"This is the most important question of our generation; we cannot fail."
"If we do not reach a deal tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we will keep on talking until we reach a deal."
"Subject: Climate change funding for the developing world"
"The upcoming climate change talks in Copenhagen are set to define global attitudes to climate change in the short to medium term."
"It is crucial that agreement is reached and that rich countries front up the money to pay for the effects of climate change in the developing world."
"We cannot reasonably expect developing countries to pay for the effects of a problem that the Western World has caused."
"The agreement reached in October at the European Council Summit estimated that developing countries would need EUR 100 billion in order to adapt to climate change, whereas developing countries argue that the cost would be three to four times as much."
"How does the Council intend to reach a compromise between such disparate figures?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - As the honourable Member rightly points out, climate financing for developing countries is an essential element of the negotiations in Copenhagen and it will be key to reaching an agreement."
"To start with, I would like to point out again that at the October European Council, we stressed the importance of fast-start financing in order to initiate immediate actions and to prepare for collective and efficient action in the medium and longer term with a special emphasis on these developed countries."
"At the December Council a few days ago, the EU and its Member States expressed their readiness to allocate EUR 2.4 billion a year for the years 2010-2012 to help developing countries in their fight against climate change."
"With this commitment I think we did send a very strong message to the negotiators at their ongoing conference and strengthened our credibility."
"The European Council furthermore recognised the need for a significant increase in public and private financial flows up to 2020."
"The current financial architecture needs to be revised and, where necessary, reformed in order to ensure its capacity to meet the challenge."
"As you have pointed out in your question, the October European Council has endorsed the Commission estimate that a total net incremented cost of adaptation and mitigation in developing countries could amount to around EUR 100 billion per year by 2020, to be met through a combination of developing countries' own efforts, the international carbon market and international public finance; and this is what the Commission has estimated the need to be."
"It is not an offer or a bid from the EU."
"There is also a wide range of other estimates from other sources, but it is the Commission estimate that the Council has endorsed and believes to be the best assessment."
"The overall level of international public support required is estimated to lie in the range of EUR 22 billion to EUR 50 billion per year to 2020."
"The EU and its Member States are ready to take a fair share of that amount, but all countries except the poorest ones should contribute to international public financing through a comprehensive distribution key based on emission levels and GDP."
"And as the European Council stressed in October, the Copenhagen agreement needs to include provisions on the objective that global warming should not exceed 2 °C, ambitious emission reduction commitments by developed countries, adaptation technology and a deal on financing."
"I join with Mr Kelly in expressing my appreciation for the Minister's replies in the House and for the conduct of the Swedish Presidency in general, which has been exemplary."
"Minister, we have noted in recent days that the President of the United States has been in discussions with certain leaders in the developing world."
"Has the European Union joined in those discussions in trying to bridge the gap with the United States and others to try to bring the remaining issues to a resolution?"
"Can the Minister assure the House that, if there is to be funding for this, for the developing world, that it will be new money, that it will not be money that comes out of existing commitments to the developing world in terms of the hunger and development agenda?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Regarding the first question, there have been numerous bilateral meetings during the autumn in order to try to facilitate and prepare for the negotiations."
"The EU is in constant contact with the United States of America trying to push and to call for a more ambitious statement from them."
"They, in their turn, have their own bilateral contacts; on some of these occasions, we have been involved and in some not, because we are trying to push from different corners."
"We have also had six bilateral meetings during the Swedish presidency with important stakeholders such as China, India, Ukraine, South Africa, Russia and the United States."
"Climate issues have been top of the agenda on all these occasions, so there has been a wide variety of meetings."
"Regarding financing, it is a combination of old and new money, I must say."
"Some countries have made a mixture."
"Some have already allocated parts of their development budget."
"As the least-developed countries are the ones who will suffer mostly from climate change, therefore it is logical that certain parts of the development budget are pinpointed to different kinds of climate actions."
"Now, as a consequence of the economic crisis, many Member States have lowered their ambitions on their total development budgets, and that is deplorable."
"It is a combination, and that is also very much due to the fact of the economic crisis."
"Subject: Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment for persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation"
"It is absolutely vital to underline the importance of the general principle of access for all."
"This will bring benefits not only for people with disabilities, but for the majority of people in Europe's society within 10 years."
"Will the Council consider establishing a uniform basis for an anti-discrimination policy, without exemptions (e.g. for the design and manufacture of goods), in order to create a sustainable society and eliminate the hierarchy of legal provisions on combating discrimination?"
"Given that access to infrastructure and services is a very real challenge for many people in many countries, I regard it as totally unacceptable to postpone for 10 or 20 years the imposition on Member States of a requirement to adopt new rules providing for genuine, better accessibility of (new) infrastructure and (new) services."
"Is the Council in any way considering a further extension of the deadline for transposition of the accessibility requirement for existing and/or new infrastructure?"
"If so, why?"
"As the honourable Member states in his question, measures to improve access are vital in the fight against discrimination."
"During the Swedish Presidency, we have continued to study at a technical level the proposed Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment."
"This covers four reasons for discrimination that are not currently included in the area of employment: religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation."
"On 30 November 2009, the Council studied a status report from the Presidency which calls attention to the need for further work on this issue, particularly as regards the scope, provisions concerning disability and the timetable for implementation."
"The Presidency further reported that the specific issue of the 'design' or 'manufacture of goods' should also be covered by the proposal."
"This needs to be discussed further."
"According to the status report, there are other issues to resolve in respect of the financial consequences of the directive."
"If we are to achieve political unity, we need to produce a text acceptable to every Member State."
"We need all the Member States to be in agreement before we can proceed further in the Council."
"I cannot anticipate the results of the negotiations, however."
"Discussions concerning implementation, dates and scope are still in progress and will continue for some time yet."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Minister, for your answer."
"The initial steps which have been taken are very encouraging, but I would like to highlight three matters."
"There are 50 million people with disabilities living in the European Union."
"This issue does not only affect them because European Union society is also ageing drastically."
"Therefore, this problem does not only affect people with disabilities, but also the future of any elderly person, as well as all those in wheelchairs, for instance, if they need a ramp."
"This means that, overall, this quickly becomes an issue for the whole of society, which is why it must be dealt with as a priority, as this is the future we face."
"Access to services has been postponed for 10 years."
"It is important that this deadline remains in place, precisely because it is in all our interests."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I definitely agree with the honourable Member about the need for such a directive."
"There are still millions of people in the European Union who do not have access to the most ordinary things in life."
"This hinders their freedom and the possibility of their living a normal life and I deplore that very much."
"The Council discussions are taking a lot of time."
"It is a ground-breaking proposal and it has a broad scope with enormous practical and financial implications."
"Unanimity will be needed between the Member States and, after that, the consent of the European Parliament, before the directive can be adopted."
"We have had negotiations."
"We had lots of working groups within the Council."
"We have made progress but, unfortunately - I have to be very honest with you - we have not reached the consensus that is required yet. But we will continue until the end of our Presidency, and I am quite optimistic that the Spanish Presidency will do their utmost to reach a solution."
"Subject: Safeguarding the rights of disabled people"
"When economic conditions are complicated, it is very important to ensure adequate social protection for the most socially disadvantaged."
"Disabled people constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in society."
"It is highly regrettable that attempts are being made to balance national budgets by reducing social benefits and programmes for disabled people."
"This not only runs counter to the principles of solidarity and social justice but weakens the processes and mechanisms integrating disabled people into society and increases their social exclusion."
"Has the Council made provision for additional measures to help disabled people during an economic recession?"
"Will not the unfavourable economic situation slow down consideration in Council of a proposal for a Council Directive putting into practice the principles of equal treatment for disabled people?"
"We are all aware of the social problems following in the wake of the economic crisis."
"It is essential to provide special protection for people and groups who are particularly vulnerable and to combat exclusion."
"We know that there is often a failure to exploit the potential of those with disabilities and other vulnerable groups of people because of discrimination."
"In view of this, the Council has consistently stressed the importance of promoting access to the labour market for people with disabilities."
"This has been done within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, including the current guidelines on employment."
"In March 2008, the Council - together with the governments of the Member States - also passed a resolution on the situation of people with disabilities within the EU."
"The importance of integrating vulnerable people and groups into the labour market is further endorsed by the Council in its conclusions of 13 November 2009, which I made reference to in relation to the previous question."
"Facilitating access to the labour market for these groups is also a prerequisite for long-term growth."
"I would like to remind you of the joint agreement by the European Parliament and the Council to designate 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"I believe that this decision will also include access to education for all."
"Moreover, the decision involves working to achieve equal access for all to information and communication technology, giving particular consideration to the needs of disabled people."
"A further priority that will be addressed concerns the needs of disabled people and their families and of other vulnerable groups."
"We are looking forward to the many initiatives that I am sure will be taken in the year ahead."
"As regards the proposed Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, we realise that life for people with disabilities would be very positively affected were the Commission's proposal to become a reality."
"The Council's working group on social issues is still working on the text."
"As I mentioned, we held a discussion on 30 November and prepared a status report, but we did not succeed in reaching a decision."
"We cannot anticipate the result of negotiations that are still in progress, but it is essential that we get the wording right because it is a matter of legal certainty and defining the scope of the directive."
"As mentioned previously, the Member States must be in agreement on the proposal."
"It is their job to assess any repercussions of the economic recession in this context."
"Once unanimity has been achieved, the European Parliament will naturally be asked to give its consent in accordance with Article 19 of the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"(LT) Thank you, Madam President and thank you, Minister Malmström for your response."
"I would also like to thank Sweden, because it was precisely during the Swedish Presidency that the EU's Council of Ministers ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities."
"This is a great step, but it is only one step."
"In truth, the lives of our disabled vary incredibly from country to country."
"Some deaf people are unable to use sign language, while some blind people do not have access to blind assistance services."
"There are no adjustments for persons with movement disabilities."
"Also, a significant number of disabled people are simply unemployed."
"All this when disabled people actually account for around 10% of our residents in the European Union."
"Minister, I know that there are certain problems and difficulties with the directive on anti-discrimination (this is how I would summarise it), but perhaps it would be possible to have a separate directive on the rights of the disabled sooner."
"Our directive would be binding for all EU Member States, so that disabled people would not face discrimination."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Let me underline that it is not a lack of political will."
"We do understand the importance of this directive and we have been working really, really hard to get it into place."
"But, as I have said, I cannot change the fact that we need unanimity, and the unanimity is not there."
"The Swedish Presidency and presidencies before us have worked to try to propose different compromises, different ways forward."
"There are lots of working groups meeting and working all the time; and they still are meeting."
"We will work on the issue until the end of our presidency."
"But, unfortunately, we do not have the unanimity yet."
"It would be unfortunate to separate the different parts of the directive because the whole purpose - and this was very much also encouraged by Parliament - was to have a comprehensive directive on discrimination."
"If we start to pick up pieces, I think that thought would be lost and I think it would be deplorable."
"So let us try a little bit more to get the whole directive into place because that would be very valuable in the fight against discrimination, for disabled people, but also for other discriminated people all around Europe."
"(DE) We must prevent discrimination, which is a social problem."
"It is up to all of us to prevent discrimination of any kind."
"Do you share my opinion that there are no clear standards for determining whether discrimination has occurred, an example being a situation where a landlord rents out a flat and an applicant claims that he had been discriminated against because he did not get the flat?"
"Do you agree that a European directive can only lay down requirements that the Member States would then have to transpose into national law?"
"It is very difficult for Europe to establish a European law in this area."
"Could I just acknowledge, since we are talking about the rights of disabled people, that our colleague, Mr Kósa, has just been elected president of the Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament."
"We wish him well in that."
"Specifically regarding the economic crisis, on which we had a debate yesterday and you were nodding in agreement: we have huge concerns about institutional care of children and young adults, and I worry that the economic crisis - and perhaps you share this - will slow the process of de-institutionalisation, and that this is an issue we need to be very careful of, both within and outside the EU."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - In times of economic crisis it is always the most vulnerable who suffer the most - children, young people, old people, people with disabilities - and that is why we, as responsible politicians, have to be very aware of this."
"It has been added to the conclusions of various Council formations and recommendations that Member States should be encouraged to take particular consideration of the fact that the most vulnerable groups are always those who suffer most, so I do agree with that."
"In response to your question, without first having the general overall far-reaching directive, it is very difficult to set standards of a European character in the area of discrimination against disabled people."
"We need to have the overall directive first and then work from there."
"I realise that a great deal of work has to be done, and I am well aware of the massive discrimination and the difficulties that disabled people face in ordinary life, which hinder them in fulfilling their life's possibilities and potential."
"I think we need to work on the overall directive first."
"The decision to have next year as the year for combating social exclusion presents the possibility to come up with new concrete proposals and organise common events to reinforce this issue and awareness in all Member States."
"I am sure that in the context of this discussion, the House would wish me also to congratulate Mr Kósa on his election to the Intergroup chair."
"Questions 8 and 9 have been withdrawn."
"Question 10 will not be taken as the subject to which it refers already appears in the agenda for this part-session."
"As the author is not present, Question 11 lapses."
"Subject: Appalling murders of poor Peruvian farmers for profit"
"Articles in the international press report that, in recent years in Peru, dozens of peasants in the Huánuco and Pasco regions have been murdered by a gang known as 'Los Pishtacos' in order to sell their body fat - reportedly amounting to 17 kilos - to European cosmetics manufacturers for 15 000 dollars per kilo."
"The Peruvian authorities consider that the disappearance of numerous people, including children, is attributable to this appalling practice."
"We condemn the practices of European multinational companies which have been killing people and plundering the wealth of Latin America for profit for many decades."
"What is the Council's overall view of this criminal act by European multinational companies and what is the level of EU funding for these companies operating in Latin America?"
"As the honourable Member knows, respect for human rights is one of the founding values of the European Union."
"In all its relations with third countries, the Council always pays particular attention to ensuring that basic rights and the rule of law are respected."
"With regard to the specific incidents mentioned by the honourable Member, the Council was not aware of these and they have not been discussed in the Council."
"The Presidency has also read the newspapers and is aware of the reports in the media, but also notes that the latest reports suggest that the original story was a hoax."
"Since the media reports are contradictory and as the Council does not normally comment on reports in the media, the Presidency cannot and should not speculate on this story or respond to this question."
"(EL) Madam President, I must say that the Minister's reply does not satisfy me in the slightest."
"This is an horrendous crime, an unprecedented crime, I would say, and in any event, I consider that the European Union, when it wants to, has the resources to investigate issues of this sort in greater detail."
"Because we have relations with Peru, we demand official information on the part of the Peruvian Government about this specific incident and that measures be taken."
"Otherwise, we shall see a repeat of the same situation."
"The reports on this have been extremely contradictory."
"It has emerged both from the authorities and from reports by journalists that there is no evidence to indicate that these terrible events actually occurred."
"Since there are no certain indications and there is much to suggest that in actual fact, they did not happen and that instead it was a hoax, the Council is unable to take action in this area; neither is it competent to do so."
"Subject: Discrimination against the Polish minority in Lithuania"
"Does the Council intend to compel the Lithuanian Government to respect the rights of national minorities, given that discrimination against the Polish minority in Lithuania has a long history and manifests itself in the obligation to use the Lithuanian spellings of Polish surnames, discrimination in education, the ban on bilingual place names and the failure to return property seized from Poles by the Soviet authorities?"
"When does the Council intend to take action in these matters?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - The Council reaffirms the primacy of fundamental and human rights as recognised in the treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Council is - and will remain - committed to the prevention and eradication of all forms of degrading and discriminatory treatment."
"I would like to note that questions concerning the protection of minority rights are also dealt with by the Council of Europe under its framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities."
"The issues raised by Mr Czarnecki are currently being examined by the competent organs of the Council of Europe."
"In particular, under Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, all persons are protected against discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin, regardless of their legal status."
"The scope of legal protection of this directive includes the areas of employment, social protection, education and access to goods and services."
"It is the responsibility of the European Commission to monitor the implementation of, and compliance with, European law in the Member States."
"Finally, in the Stockholm Programme approved by the European Council on 10 and 11 December this year, the need for an additional proposal as regards vulnerable groups is assessed in the light of the experience acquired from the application by the Member States of the 2000 Hague Convention on the international protection of adults, to which they will become parties in the future."
"(PL) Thank you very much, Mrs Malmström, for your answer, and especially for emphasising that the Council will oppose all forms of discrimination against national minorities in the European Union, including the Polish minority in Lithuania."
"This is a very important statement."
"Thank you for this."
"I would like to stress that we are dealing, unfortunately, with the systematic activity of the Lithuanian authorities concerning the education system and bilingual place names, and at various levels of the administration."
"It is, therefore, an extremely significant matter, and I would ask for it to be monitored by the Council."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I can only reiterate the principles and the values that the European Union stands for and that the Council, of course, defends."
"Also, the particular events that Mr Czarnecki refers to are being examined by the relevant authorities of the Council of Europe and, should there be any other form of discrimination, it is the Commission's task to make sure that the Member States comply with the treaties and with the laws of the European Union."
"Subject: Persecution of Buddhist monks and nuns in Vietnam"
"Following the adoption of the European Parliament resolution on the situation in Laos and Vietnam on 26 November 2009 (P7_TA(2009)0104), what concrete measures have been taken to address the persecution and harassment of Buddhist monks and nuns in Vietnam?"
"Thank you for your question."
"The Council is extremely aware of the human rights situation in Vietnam and we are monitoring developments in the country closely."
"Twice a year, the Council and the Commission make an assessment of the situation within the framework of the human rights dialogue that we have with the Vietnamese authorities."
"The latest dialogue meeting was held in Hanoi last week, on 11 December."
"Many urgent issues were discussed, such as freedom of expression, reform of the penal code, including the death penalty, as well as freedom of religion and religious tolerance, including the situation of the adherents of Plum Village."
"An EU list of persons and prisoners whose situation is of particular cause for concern was given to the Vietnamese Government."
"In addition to the human rights dialogue, the EU also regularly raises issues of particular concern with the Vietnamese Government."
"On 10 November, the Council and the Commission held a long discussion with the members of the Plum Village community."
"On 26 November, the resolution from the European Parliament concerning the issue was published."
"The same day, the Commission held high level talks with the authorities in Hanoi and this meeting took place within the framework of the Joint Committee for the negotiation of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which we hope will be concluded next year."
"Our main message at the meeting was to express how pressing we consider the human rights situation in Vietnam to be."
"We mentioned the expropriation of church property, we mentioned the attacks on campaigners for human rights and blog writers - as brought up by Members previously in this House - and we also mentioned the situation of the adherents of Plum Village."
"We called upon our counterparts to safeguard and respect human rights and to meet all the commitments set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international conventions to which Vietnam is party."
"The Parliamentary resolution made this message particularly forceful, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for that."
"We also informed Vietnam of the new and important role of the European Parliament, particularly as regards the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"On 8-10 December 2009, an EU delegation visited the Bat Nha monastery and the Phuoc Hue temple, to which nearly 200 remaining members of Plum Village have fled."
"We spoke to the religious representatives there and the local authorities in order to obtain more information on the current situation."
"The EU will continue to monitor the situation at the Phuoc Hue temple very closely."
"deputising for the author. - I would like to thank the President-in-Office on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr Crowley for her very comprehensive response and to say that I am very pleased with the approach of both the Council and the Commission."
"I hope that you will continue to monitor developments in a pragmatic way."
"Subject: Iceland's application to join the European Union"
"Can the Council provide an updated assessment on the status of Iceland's application to join the European Union?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I think this a question dear to you as well."
"(SV) Let me begin by reminding you of what was stated in the Council's conclusions of 8 December, where the Council writes the following: 'Iceland is a country with long and deep democratic roots, with the potential to make a significant contribution to the EU, both strategically and politically."
"The country is already closely integrated with the EU in several areas, through its membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen area.'"
"Iceland's application for membership of the European Union was officially submitted to the Swedish Presidency in Stockholm on 16 July 2009."
"I myself was there and received the application, which was immediately forwarded to the members of the Council."
"At its meeting on 27 July 2009, the Council gave a reminder of the renewed consensus on enlargement that was described in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in December 2006, including the principle that each country is to be assessed on its own merits, and we decided to initiate the process stated in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Commission was therefore asked to submit an opinion on this application to the Council."
"The application will be assessed according to the principles set out in the treaty, the criteria established at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen in 1992 and the conclusions of the European Council's meeting in December 2006."
"In accordance with the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council last week, it will take up the matter again when the Commission has submitted its opinion."
"This should make it possible for the Council to make a decision on the possible opening of negotiations with Iceland during the initial months of the Spanish Presidency."
"I want to thank the President-in-Office for her response."
"As Chair of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee, I fully understand that, of course, every application has to be dealt with on its own merits and progress is being made."
"I think an indication of that is that Iceland responded to the many questions within a reasonably short time and, of course, it was helpful that it is a member of the EEA."
"That is an indication of the Icelandic Government's commitment."
"I believe it would be another major step in the further expansion of Europe if Iceland were to become a member of the European Union."
"However, you mentioned the old democracy as a matter for the Icelandic people to take this decision, but I look forward to further progress at the next Council meeting and, hopefully, a major step will be taken there and that there would be an announcement by the Council."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - The Icelandic application has to be dealt with in accordance with the rules and procedures, and the Commission has not yet finalised its scrutiny and its elaboration of the opinion."
"They are making progress, as is Iceland, and they have already appointed their negotiation teams and are prepared to be very thorough but quick in their work."
"I think therefore that we can count on the Commission presenting an opinion at the beginning of next year and hopefully, the Council can take a decision on further measures."
"As the author is not present, Question 16 lapses."
"Subject: Biodegradable waste"
"Can the Council comment on Member State progress with regard to diverting biodegradable waste from landfill, as outlined in the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC)?"
"Every day, large quantities of waste are produced in the EU's Member States."
"How we deal with this waste naturally has a major impact on the environment."
"The Commission's recently published report on the implementation of the EU's legislation on waste concludes that although some Member States have made progress, huge implementation efforts are required in a great many States if the infrastructure for waste management is to meet EU requirements."
"The Directive on landfill is particularly difficult to implement."
"As regards diverting biodegradable waste from landfill, the Commission's report states that only nine countries achieved their target reductions in 2006 - according to the fairly limited information available."
"The Council has stated previously in its conclusions of June 2009 that it agrees with the Commission."
"It is very important that the EU's targets for diverting biodegradable waste from landfill are met."
"The Council also called upon the Commission to continue with its impact analysis in order to prepare a proposal for EU legislation on biodegradable waste if appropriate."
"The Council stated that the need for EU legislation should be noted, and particularly the need for legislation on the recycling of biodegradable waste by means of composting and energy recovery in biogas facilities with subsequent recycling of residual material."
"The Council also stated that better management of biodegradable waste would contribute to more sustainable management of our resources, increase land protection, help combat climate change and, in particular, enable targets for diverting waste from landfill, recycling and renewable energy to be met."
"I think everyone in this House supports the efforts."
"If you stand, as I have, on a landfill and inhale, it is pretty awful, and I think the public who dump should perhaps take a visit."
"Could you, if you have any, give reasons that you could elaborate on as to why only nine Member States are at this stage?"
"We know we need to do this;"
"I agree we need to do biogas."
"Everybody agrees with the principles, but why are we failing to achieve the objectives?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - I have to confess that I am not an expert on this theme, but, as far as I understood from the Commission statements, the appropriate infrastructure to deal with it is missing and it is quite costly to put into place."
"It is of course beneficial in the long term, but Member States have not invested in the appropriate infrastructure and that is why it has taken so much time."
"We will now take what will be the last question this evening, and indeed the last question of your presidency."
"It comes from Mr Hans-Peter Martin and concerns successes by the Swedish Council Presidency in matters of transparency where, I dare say, we have something to report."
"Subject: Successes by the Swedish Council Presidency in matters of transparency"
"On 16 September 2009, the Swedish Presidency stated in its answer to my question that it 'shares the Honourable Member's view on the importance of increased transparency in the work of the Union'."
"It went on to state that 'the Presidency intends to give full effect to the relevant transparency provisions, set out in Article 8 paragraphs 1 - 4, of the Council's Rules of Procedure."
"In principle, all deliberations on legislative acts to be adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure will be open to the public, as provided in the Council's Rules of Procedure'."
"Now that it has reached the end of its Presidency, what specific successes were achieved by the Council and in which fields?"
"As the honourable Member points out, increasing transparency in the work of the European Union is an important priority for Sweden as a Member State and as the holder of the Presidency."
"Increasing transparency in every area of the Council's work was one of the clear aims that we set out."
"I would like to mention, for example, the Presidency website, where information on meetings, background documents and webstreaming links can be found in three languages."
"In the last few months, the Presidency has also done its utmost to ensure that the provisions on transparency in the Council's Rules of Procedure are applied."
"In July, September, October and November 2009, 20 public debates were held on the initiative of the Swedish Presidency, in accordance with Rule 8.3 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Moreover, a public debate was held on the Presidency's work programme for the work of the Ecofin Council."
"That makes 21 public debates held over four months."
"As regards the number of public deliberations, 59 items of legislation were adopted publicly as A items within the ordinary legislative procedure and nine proposed items of legislation were discussed as B items during a public Council meeting."
"Furthermore, one public deliberation was held on the initiative of the Presidency."
"If the honourable Member thinks that does not sound like much, it should be borne in mind that the number of items on the Council's agenda for which public deliberations must be held varies somewhat depending on the number of items that are subject to the ordinary legislative procedure."
"Moreover, the new parliament has not had as many items as usual."
"The new Commission will no doubt increase the number of legislative proposals that are to be dealt with by the Council and the European Parliament and the number of items will then increase."
"Furthermore, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, all Council meetings dealing with the part of the agenda that concerns deliberations on legislation are also public."
"The Swedish Presidency welcomes this improvement."
"It will make the European Union more effective and democratic."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention that yesterday, the Swedish Presidency took the initiative for a meeting with the interinstitutional working group on transparency with Commission Vice-President Margot Wallström and Vice-President Diana Wallis."
"We discussed a great many specific proposals for providing Europe's citizens with better, more user-friendly access to information in the EU institutions."
"(DE) It is rare for there to be cause in plenary for a certain kind of emotion."
"I think it is an honour and a pleasure that we, specifically, are able to hold the final dialogue."
"Mrs Malmström, you know, yourself, that it is a slow, narrow path towards more transparency, which we, unfortunately, often only progress along at a snail's pace, if I think about where we were ten years ago and where we are today."
"Nevertheless, as a critical but passionate pro-European, I clearly cannot be satisfied merely with what we have achieved thus far."
"I would be interested to know what message you would leave us with as regards what your successors could actually improve."
"I am thinking in particular of the Council working groups."
"I am actually not happy about the number of agenda items that have been publicly accessible up to now, nor about the manner in which access to the documents is obtained."
"Taking a long-term perspective from your ten years of experience in European politics, do you think that we will ever reach the stage in terms of transparency that Sweden reached decades ago?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - It is indeed a very important question."
"I would say that access to documents and transparency has increased considerably over the last ten years."
"This is due to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which is a very important regulation, and I am proud to have been able to take part in the birth of this regulation."
"It is also how we implement it and it is about attitudes."
"They have improved during the last 10 years."
"Lots of people in our European institutions have realised that transparency and openness is not dangerous."
"It is good."
"It is efficient."
"It is good for legitimacy and it also decreases the possibilities of wrongdoings and corruption."
"We still have work to do."
"The Lisbon Treaty presents us with new possibilities."
"I hope all incoming presidencies will use those possibilities in the best possible way."
"The Commission said yesterday that they will come back with proposals arising from the Lisbon Treaty as to how we can move forward with transparency."
"There is still a lot to do, but we have come quite a long way."
"As the honourable Member says, it is a constant fight, and I look forward to going along that fighting path together."
"It therefore remains for me to say, Minister, dear Cecilia, thank you very much for your cooperation and such full participation in Question Time during the Swedish Presidency."
"We look forward, subject to the approval of this House, to seeing you on that side."
"Thank you very much, and thank you to your team."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09.00)"
"Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Heide Rühle, Adam Bielan and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the transposition of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications (O-0108/2009/rev.2 - B7-0217/2009)."
"author. - Mr President, with your permission, I would propose that we delay a moment or two because this is an oral question to the Commission and we were hoping that Mr McCreevy would be here, but I see that Mr Samecki is going to speak."
"I have not met Mr Samecki before, so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on. Thank you very much."
"I was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here."
"Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward."
"It is nevertheless very good that he is here."
"The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market."
"It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005, and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States."
"It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market."
"He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation, but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market."
"In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as the text of our question quite clearly sets out, we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union."
"It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level."
"Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States."
"One of the things that our own research has done, and this committee commissioned research on this topic, is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition."
"The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework."
"There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism, about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms."
"We know from the statistics and the information - and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly - that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State."
"It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation, and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself."
"Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years, I am delighted that, I think, all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done, together with myself, on shaping the forward agenda for this committee."
"This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off."
"It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate, to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations, the key building blocks of the single market."
"We know that the Commission is due to review the mutual recognition directive in 2011."
"We plan to have a meeting of national parliaments and national parliamentarians to discuss this proposal."
"We have already had a hearing on this and we have our research report."
"These are the instruments that my committee can use and, if the coordinators agree, I am sure that we will be doing an own-initiative report sometime in 2010 to feed into this discussion that the Commission will have."
"That is the context of the question."
"We look forward to hearing the Commission's reply to set the framework for that, but this is just the beginning of the process and I am sure that the new Commissioner will be able to take that forward and work with us to really develop this crucial piece of legislation and make the single market work better."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for raising these important questions."
"Before responding to the individual questions, let me start with an overview."
"The objective of the Professional Qualifications Directive is to facilitate the free movement of our citizens in the internal market."
"Two years after the end of the transposition period, transposition is complete in 22 Member States, and four Member States will hopefully deliver by the end of the year."
"At this stage I am, however, concerned about Greece, from which we have not received any transposition measure yet."
"Let me now turn to the first question."
"The transposition has constituted a challenge for Member States mainly because it affects more than 800 different professions."
"These professions have often even been regulated in federal or regional laws."
"However, this cannot be an excuse for any delays, and the Court of Justice has not accepted such delays in six judgments so far."
"Concerning the second question, the main problems relate to the health professions and architects, where a higher degree of harmonisation of training requirements at European level is in place."
"Problems also occur in professions with higher levels of cross-border mobility of workers such as teachers or tourist guides."
"On the third question, the priority of the Commission is to ensure correct and consistent implementation of the directive."
"To this end, we have developed a code of conduct on administrative practices and a user guide addressed to citizens, which will also promote more consistency."
"As to the obstacles which Solvit identified, we are fully aware of problems on the ground, such as delays occurring in the recognition procedure, lack of response from the national competent authorities, unsubstantiated decisions, lost files, etc. Sometimes, erroneous information is even given to migrants and they are invited to follow wrong procedures."
"However, the Solvit network has proven to be effective in solving many of these problems."
"But there is not only Solvit."
"National contact points are now in place in all Member States to inform and assist citizens, and the Commission expects them to be even more active in the future."
"Moreover, the Internal Market Information System has also provided a medium for supporting more than 1 200 information exchanges for many of the regulated professions this year."
"This has brought about enhancements in day-to-day administrative cooperation between Member States."
"Finally, on the last question, the Commission is not in a position to assess whether there is a need for reform at the moment."
"This will be done during an ex post evaluation exercise foreseen by the directive."
"Our intention is certainly to respect the timetable set in the directive."
"It will be up to the next Commission to decide how to take this forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005, we adopted this directive after several years of work and debate in Parliament and it came into force."
"In 2007, it was implemented."
"Now we have reached 2009 and it is hard to accept that the directive has not been implemented everywhere, particularly since it was not completely new, because there were already proposals in place."
"I can only encourage the Commission to exert more pressure on the Member States."
"I had expected that the problems would lie in the practical management of the directive."
"That is the main subject of the forthcoming investigations: to find out where there are specific local problems and to discover what is actually happening."
"There has already been a reference to the fact that 20% of the complaints to SOLVIT concern this subject."
"This is a very serious matter."
"Mr Harbour rightly pointed out - and I do not want to repeat what he said - the importance of this problem for the internal market from an economic perspective."
"However, apart from the economic issues, it is also one of the fundamental freedoms of citizens to be able to exercise their profession and to fulfil their potential in another state, for example, when they marry or move to another country for some other reason."
"This is a genuine problem for the citizens of Europe."
"It is important for us to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problems."
"It is a complex matter, it takes time to implement and different cultures and traditions are involved, particularly with regard to the professions and the concepts of quality and qualifications within those professions."
"Therefore, it is not possible to recognise every qualification from one country in another country without question."
"For me and for us, this is less about dealing with the individual cases of hardship which will inevitably occur and more about investigating - and this is where SOLVIT comes in - whether there are faults in the structures or in the system and whether and how improvements can be introduced."
"I would like to point out that it will never be possible to bring this subject to a close."
"It is a long-running issue because new professions and new job descriptions are, of course, constantly coming into existence."
"For this reason, this is an ongoing task for the Commission and for Parliament, but also for the Member States, whose goodwill I would like to call on at this point."
"Mr President, I would first like to say that it is totally outrageous that there are no members of the Commission here, because this is a question directed at the European Commission."
"This shows contempt for Parliament."
"It is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable."
"(Heckling)"
"Yes?"
"Yes, he did not get up."
"Well, I am sorry."
"I cannot accept that."
"Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work."
"We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date."
"I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement."
"There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect."
"I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament."
"We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced."
"This will put into citizens' hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe."
"There are organisations which are attempting to do this."
"However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up."
"The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental rights of the European Union's citizens."
"This also includes the free movement of professionals, which is a vital condition for ensuring that the internal market operates as efficiently as possible."
"As has been mentioned in all the speeches made so far, in spite of the adoption of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in 2005, professionals wishing to exercise their right of free movement are still encountering numerous difficulties."
"I have personally come across various cases of this type, which have been brought to my knowledge not only by Romanian citizens, but also by European citizens, relating to a variety of professions."
"My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection did the honour of appointing me as rapporteur for the European Solvit network."
"As has been mentioned so far, a significant proportion of the cases which Solvit has to resolve are linked to failures in the system for mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"I believe, fellow Members, that we need to analyse in detail the problems which have been submitted to the Solvit centres so that we can see what we can improve."
"Better communication is also needed between contact points in order to promote mutual understanding between Member States."
"They must understand how the other systems work in the European Union so that the maximum possible flexibility can be used when applying the directive, as well as to avoid the administrative obstacles blocking the professionals' path."
"Lastly, it would be desirable for the five Member States which have not yet completed transposition of the directive, or any state among the 22 which has done this but is still having problems with transposition or has transposed it inappropriately, to quickly rectify these situations."
"The ultimate aim is to facilitate the smooth operation of the internal market for the provision of services which is directly affected by problems relating to the recognition of professional qualifications."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all agree on the objective here."
"Of course, we all want the citizens of Europe to be able to move about freely and to exercise their professions."
"The question is why this directive has still not been properly implemented after four or now nearly five years."
"I believe it would make sense if the committee was involved not only in drawing up and enacting the legislation, but if it also carried out an analysis afterwards of the reasons why transposition is delayed in this way."
"The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is not the only directive which is causing problems."
"When there are so many cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union, when there are so many complaints procedures and when SOLVIT is so heavily involved with this subject, this should act as a wake-up call for us."
"We must look more closely at the reasons behind this."
"There are a number of causes."
"On the one hand, it is always very easy to say that the Member States are responsible for the delay."
"Protectionism is doubtless another of the reasons."
"The different cultures and legal systems certainly also play a role."
"What effect does European legislation have on these differing legal systems?"
"That is another issue that we will have to address."
"In addition, we must consider whether the directive has had the intended effect or whether it was incapable of achieving certain results right from its conception."
"I believe it is very important that we look at this issue again."
"This type of ex-ante analysis is one of the important subjects which this committee will have to deal with and make progress on."
"However, I also have questions for the Commission."
"I am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years."
"This could have been done much earlier."
"However, I do welcome the guidelines."
"I have read them and they are certainly helpful."
"Nevertheless, it would have been useful to have them some time ago."
"I would like to join with Mrs Gebhardt in asking what is happening about the European professional card."
"That will be the second important step."
"Mr President, the crisis which has affected the European Union in recent months has shown irrefutably how important the internal market is for the functioning of the entire Union."
"We will not finish building it without introducing a certain freedom for people to migrate, which is guaranteed, among others, by the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"Therefore, it is a sad and disturbing fact that, four years after adoption of the directive, it still is not in force in four countries, and none of the Member States adopted it before the deadline contained in the directive, 20 October 2007."
"In relation to this, my first question to the European Commission is as follows: has the Commission not been too passive over the last four years, and what exactly did the Commission do so that all the countries would manage to transpose the directive in time?"
"Secondly, I would like to ask when the Commission will publish a report evaluating transposition of the directive, and what will be used as the basis for the conclusions in the report?"
"The Services Directive should be implemented at the end of the year."
"Today, in Parliament, we know already that many countries will not manage to pass laws about this in time."
"I would like to ask what connection the Commission sees between these two documents?"
"Finally, a very important matter for the country I represent is the question of migration of nurses."
"The directive introduces harmonisation of training requirements for nurses."
"I would like to ask what specific action the Commission has taken to help nurses from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including those from Poland?"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for presenting its opinion to us."
"However, I would also like to point out that, following the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and Parliament, and I have seen this happen with the Services Directive, which we discussed in Brussels months ago, Parliament has a right to demand that the Commissioner responsible should be here to answer difficult questions."
"I do not think that we can resolve this issue with this Commission and there is no point in trying to do so."
"On behalf of Parliament, I would like to explain to the representative of the Commission who is here that we believe that this part of the interinstitutional agreement is extremely important."
"Why is that?"
"Not for reasons of mere formalism, but because this is a very important political question for the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr Bielan has just referred to the Services Directive, which can only function if professional qualifications are recognised by both sides."
"It is of great importance, but many people also connect it with a feeling of helplessness, if they have the impression that their employer is making use of discrepancies in the cross-border mutual recognition of professional qualifications simply to reduce their earnings."
"These people feel abandoned and helpless."
"I have seen this myself in a number of cases here on the border between Germany and France."
"However, this is obviously not the only problem area."
"It is true that we cannot resolve all the difficulties overnight and that this process will remain an ongoing issue in future, as Mr Lechner, the rapporteur, has said."
"Nevertheless, it is our job to show the citizens that we take their concerns seriously and, in my opinion, this also includes the Commission attaching sufficient importance to this issue."
"I hope that we will be able to work together with the new Commission on this in order to make progress."
"I would like to ask you to arrange this with the Directorate General responsible for this area."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive."
"In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic."
"Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text."
"Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account."
"The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens."
"The most obvious example is that of the medical professions."
"For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries."
"What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription?"
"Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State."
"This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary."
"I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card."
"This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens' trust."
"Mr President, when discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the good functioning of the internal market, we have to look at the current situation in the health sector, for which the directive and its implementation may need to be further discussed."
"In addition to the full implementation of this directive, it is crucial to introduce further measures applying to mutual recognition, not only of diplomas, but of health professionals' qualifications as well."
"The provision of health services requires appropriate linguistic skills, registration through national regulators and, most importantly, the ability to deliver safe and high-quality care."
"I think there is a need for better sharing of information between Member States regarding health professionals' registration, for example through a common EU database."
"A competence assurance system is also a key element of safe health care services provision, and we should think about common standards for the assessment of competences and skills."
"Health professionals' mobility is also a question of public health and public safety."
"On these grounds, the ECJ has already approved additional national safeguards for the circulation of goods."
"There is also a rationale for such measures applying to the provision of health services, especially when new communication technologies allow controversial practices such as e-doctor consultations."
"We have to face the challenge of an ageing population, and this will put even more pressure on the European health workforce."
"While ensuring the mobility of health professionals, we must also be able to guarantee to all European citizens accessible health services, timely delivered with the highest quality standards."
"This is a responsibility for all of us."
"I hope that the European institutions and Member States will consider it seriously, given the fact that some national health care systems are almost drained of professionals and this will make it extremely difficult for us to provide basic health care service."
"(PL) Mr President, if we want our citizens to be mobile - and this is what the European economy needs - they have to be sure that when they gain their qualifications, for example, in Poland, they will not have problems with recognition of these qualifications in any Member State."
"I understand the scale of the problem perfectly."
"The 800 regulated professions of which Mr Samecki spoke, together with numerous regulations of these professions at national and regional level, are a considerable challenge for the administrations of the Member States."
"However, the challenge for our citizens who are having problems with recognition of their qualifications is, principally, how to find their feet in the complexities of the entire system."
"This is confirmed by data from Solvit, and this is why the problem with implementing the directive in time is only one aspect of our discussion."
"We should not, however, forget that many problems are emerging because there is a lack of trust in Member States towards the education and training systems in other Member States."
"We lack, finally, cooperation, resources and the engagement of national administrations."
"The introduction of a European professional card is a good idea, and we had the opportunity to discuss this during the previous term of the European Parliament."
"Such a card must, however, facilitate the flow of people, and not make it more difficult."
"Introduction of this card - and I would like to stress this very strongly - should not become another barrier in the internal market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in just under ten days, the deadline for transposition of the Services Directive expires."
"I mention this because it is also important in the context of our debate today."
"These two directives complement each other in certain respects."
"Transposition of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications cannot be called a success, and so I will permit myself once again to appeal from this place for an intensification of work on both directives, because without them, we will not make progress with the internal market."
"(PT) Mr President, as we are all aware, 15 directives were consolidated into a single legislative act for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"That has given rise to a number of practical problems with transposition in the various Member States."
"The difficulties are well known, and the Commission should list the sticking points and analyse the problem areas found in the transposition of this important internal market provision."
"The protectionism that rears its head at various levels is an obstacle not only to the free movement of persons but also to the internal market."
"We must try to identify the hazy areas so that the directive is not made less effective through mistrust."
"We are not asking the Union to do what the Member States should be doing, but an effort is needed to facilitate matters by helping to demolish professional corporatism."
"To improve the transposition of this directive will require dissemination of the recognition of qualifications via the Solvit and EURES networks, the encouragement of joint platforms, implementation of effective contact points and, no less importantly, the linking of this directive to the Services Directive."
"(MT) The biggest issue affecting the proper enforcement of this directive is the Member States' lack of trust in each others' systems."
"The Member States' disinterest in collaborating with each other is also reflected in the incoherent manner in which they perceive the internal market information system."
"Every Member State claims to use the system, but the frequency of use varies in accordance with the purpose for which it is used."
"It is impossible for an information exchange system to work properly when the Member States do not use it in the same way."
"It is necessary to have a full compilation of data which is updated regularly and it is also necessary to create a point of reference for all Member States, where each Member State inputs all necessary data which will allow the concrete application of the directive."
"I would like to ask the Commission to inform us on the plans of action it intends to adopt for the proper transposition of this directive, if we truly wish to embrace the concept of the single market and not merely interpret it as we deem fit."
"Mr President, before I go onto my question, there has been a lot of talk this morning about Solvit."
"At the last IMCO Committee meeting, we were told of the under funding of Solvit centres."
"You may want to take note of this before your hearing, Mr Barnier, but there is one intern running the organisation in one large Member State."
"We cannot allow that to go on, because Solvit provides us with an excellent service."
"My question to the Commission is connected to health care professionals."
"An impaired professional risks putting patients' health at risk and, in the most extreme cases, can cause death."
"Is the Commission considering a legal duty for competent authorities to proactively and effectively share information about struck-off professionals to ensure that the mobility of health care professionals does not compromise patient safety?"
"The current internal market information system allows for the sharing of information, but only when a competent regulator has a question about an applicant to its register, so we have to have a better exchange to alert authorities when an individual has been struck off due to incompetence."
"Thank you, Mr President, for raising this issue for the committee."
"(FR) Mr President, much has been said about the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"The question is: why is this directive, which is so important and so universally longed-for, difficult to apply?"
"Well, quite simply because it is difficult and complex to apply in everyday, operational terms."
"I see three main problems: the first is obviously language, a point that has been raised; the second is the complexity of the procedures to be followed to have a person's qualifications recognised as valid - at times, people have to literally jump through hoops to have their initial diplomas recognised; and the third is perhaps the variety of types of initial training."
"In this regard, I think it would be a good idea for the Commission to ask the Member States to appoint, for each profession, a single competent professional body to be in charge of continuing training - continuing training being one of the solutions."
"These competent bodies should be asked to sit as a board, at European level, to define a common European form of certification."
"In that way, we would gradually see professionals go from an initially heterogeneous level to a common level of continuing training."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belgium is one of five Member States to have not yet fully transposed the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications."
"However, according to the information that I have, the only thing it has left to do to comply with European law is to solve the problem of travel professionals."
"Leaving aside the difficulties inherent in the Belgian institutional system with regard to the transposition of the various European directives, it seems that the directive that we are discussing here is particularly complex."
"That has already been mentioned."
"Belgium is not the only country to be affected by the non-transposition, poor transposition or partial transposition of directives."
"That is why, in the interests of professionals, I call on the European Commission to help those Member States that are having difficulties."
"Professionals should be able to benefit from the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment which, I would point out, constitute the main objective of this directive."
"Mr President, firstly, my thanks to Mr Samecki for his good work."
"I think we all agree with the principle we are discussing here this morning, but it should apply not only across the European Union but worldwide as well."
"This is something we discussed recently at the Canadian delegation, which is a step in the right direction."
"However, if we want that Utopian situation, we must ensure that professional qualifications are of an equal standard across the European Union and, ideally, worldwide."
"There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that, in some countries at least, when students have not reached the educational standard to qualify for a course, they can go to another country and pay to do it there."
"So there is a need for independent verifiable evidence that the standards are equal and, if they are equal, then there is no excuse for not transposing this principle across the European Union and, hopefully, in due course worldwide, to attain what we desire - the free movement of labour for professionals."
"Mr President, let us get straight to the point here."
"The failure of Member States to get their act together in terms of the recognition of qualifications is costing us jobs."
"The failure of Member States to actually take this seriously enough is a serious issue."
"Our level of cross-border trade for what is supposed to be a single market is nowhere near what it should be."
"We are in the process of rebuilding the European economy, and part of this move must involve ways to enhance cross-border trade and make labour more mobile than it is now."
"We must move to a new area of entrepreneurial innovation, where in Europe we are working together to make the world's most cutting-edge products."
"Given that our manufacturing base has dried up - Ireland being a case in point - exporting our services represents a new way of enhancing trade within Europe."
"However, for this, Europe must have standards when it comes to qualifications."
"So far, the failure of Member States to agree on the rules for this matter is limiting our ability to sell these same services across borders."
"For the individuals involved, it is restricting the free movement of labour."
"I agree with my colleague, MEP Grech, that Member States are not showing enough respect in particular for the information system they use and somebody needs to be held responsible in each Member State for the same."
"I urge the Commission to identify and tackle the obstacles which are preventing the realisation of the single market in this instance."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to pick out one aspect in this debate."
"There seems to be a great shortage of specialised professions, which has resulted in a trade in these qualifications and led to genuine qualifications being disregarded."
"This can entail great risks, both in the security sector, for example, and in large-scale plants such as chemical companies and oil refineries."
"National supervision in this regard seems to be inadequate."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner three questions."
"Firstly, whether he knows about this; secondly, whether the European Commission can give us a report on this; and, thirdly, what we can do about it."
"This is an absolutely ridiculous, undesirable phenomenon that I believe must be eliminated."
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen, this is really a very important issue that we are dealing with here, that of mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European Union."
"This is a major problem because qualifications are granted by the education systems of EU Member States, of which there are at least 27."
"Some of you will probably recall that, in March last year, we established the European Qualification Framework, which is a mechanism enabling comparison between education systems."
"However, one problem with this qualification framework is that it has not been implemented by the Member States."
"Some of them have not implemented it fully and some have used it merely as a convenient translator of various qualifications, occupations, skills and educational levels."
"In my opinion, a major task lies ahead for the Member States in this particular area and, if they were really to enforce the European Qualification Framework, which was previously adopted at European institution level, they would greatly facilitate the comparison and the real mutual recognition of educational qualifications."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, my apologies for not standing up during my first intervention."
"It is because of a lack of experience and the early morning hour."
"In general, I would like to refer to a couple of selected questions."
"First of all, we should underline that the Commission has been supporting Member States in preparing the transposition of the directive."
"Where the transposition period has lapsed, we have also been vigorous in enforcing transposition."
"In 2007, we published a transposition guide."
"Then we developed the internal market information system, which is now used quite intensively by all Member States, and we also published a code of conduct on administrative practices in June this year."
"A year ago, the Commission brought non-compliant Member States to the European Court of Justice, and the Court of Justice issued six favourable judgments condemning the lack of transposition by the Member States concerned."
"Very recently, we published a scoreboard illustrating the state of transposition in the Member States, as well as a user guide for citizens and the business community."
"To conclude, I would like to thank you for all the questions and comments, and especially the Chair, Malcolm Harbour, for his valuable input."
"We believe that it is up to the Member States to deliver now."
"The Commission is looking forward to developing a special relationship with Parliament also as regards this file."
"In particular, we are ready to actively discuss how the directive works in practice, and how to take best account of a swiftly changing environment in the coming years."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"One stated goal of this directive is to implement fully the current legal provisions concerning the freedom of movement of professionals within the EU."
"The free movement of professionals has already been adopted in Directive 2005/36/EC."
"However, problems are occurring repeatedly, particularly in regions near national borders."
"Many people in the region I come from work in Luxembourg, Belgium or France."
"I receive numerous enquiries from citizens who cross into one of the neighbouring countries to work."
"These enquiries often relate to the recognition of professional qualifications."
"This situation must change."
"Agreements have been reached by the professional organisations for specific professions, but this does not help in every case and all too often, citizens have to fight to have their qualifications recognised."
"It becomes particularly difficult when a particular country does not have a specific profession or that profession is organised differently, for example, physiotherapists or people with a PhD in business administration."
"At the same time, many areas are short-staffed."
"Nurses or toolmakers, for example, must, in future, have better opportunities on our labour markets and, above all, the internal market must function effectively as far as work is concerned."
"We need a transparent, simple and clear recognition procedure."
"The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Danuta Maria Hübner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the cohesion policy after 2013 (O-0121/2009/rev. 1 - B7-0229/2009)"
"author. - Mr President, three years ago, a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges."
"It was not by chance that, back in 2005 and 2006, the top priorities for European cohesion policy were: the Lisbon strategy, innovation and competitiveness, climate change, energy security and efficiency, water efficiency, investment in new skills, attractiveness of territories for young people, and quality of life."
"It is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change, not to follow it, that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for 2007-2013 all those priorities which we see today in the Commission's Europe 2020 agenda."
"That is why, more than two years ago, the Regions 2020 analytical report was published."
"The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after 2013."
"Today, we are well prepared to face the future."
"A year ago, the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package, thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis, on the one hand, and long-term sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other."
"But our oral question is about the future."
"In years to come, the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens, who are today informed citizens, fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers."
"Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls."
"Jacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates, about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united."
"European cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the European regional policy, which is today based exactly on this triple foundation: competitiveness, cooperation and solidarity."
"For years, we have talked about the need to unlock, to mobilise, the development potential of all European regions and cities."
"Experience and logic clearly show that this mobilisation turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of European governments."
"The European regional policy has already passed the subsidiarity test."
"Subsidiarity works for Europe."
"The 2006 reform of cohesion policy has made it a modern place-based policy founded on a balance between equity and efficiency, between bottom-up and top-down approaches, between common strategic European objectives and local flexibility."
"There is a need to move further on those issues, to continue the reform of policy governance, but certain principles should not be abandoned."
"The new treaty has cemented the new understanding of European subsidiarity already deeply rooted in the cohesion policy, that is, subsidiarity extended to local and regional levels of governance."
"We can do more on it, especially with regard to the local level."
"Those who suggest that cohesion policy can be limited to Brussels and national level either do not know the European reality, or do not understand that excluding local and regional Europe from the pursuit of common European objectives is economically at best unwise and politically dangerous."
"Cohesion is a notion that excludes exclusion."
"For political, economic, social and legitimacy reasons, cohesion policy must not be divisive: it should be a policy for all, as the internal market is, as the common currency is."
"All elements of this integration triangle - common market, common currency, cohesion - are mutually strengthening and interdependent."
"They are our common European public good."
"We policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver."
"The challenges are well known; the EU 2020 strategy has been opened to public consultations."
"Development policy with clear targets and tools is needed."
"Cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of European governance working in concert for European citizens."
"To conclude, Europe needs new energy to take care of its future, to renew itself in an assertive way."
"It is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from."
"For me, the answer is clear."
"Today, this energy should come from below."
"Today this energy can be released through the direct engagement of local and regional levels of European governance in the pursuit of common European objectives."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the questions put forward are very pertinent."
"They underline the importance you attach to cohesion policy as well as your dedication to keep the policy at the heart of European integration."
"As regards your question on multi-level governance, multi-level governance has been recognised as a fundamental mechanism in delivering EU policy priorities."
"The growing interdependence between different levels of government in the Union was stressed by the consultation paper launched by the Commission on the EU 2020 strategy."
"Cohesion policy is a good example of multi-level governance."
"It offers a governance system which values and exploits local and regional knowledge, combines it with strategic direction from the Community level, and coordinates interventions between levels of government."
"The strengths of multi-level governance were also stressed by the Committee of the Regions in its White Paper of June 2009, where it called on the Union to strengthen mechanisms of multi-level governance and pointed to the leverage effects generated by cohesion policy, which contributed to the implementation of other Community policies as well."
"On your two questions concerning the eventual abandonment of Objective 2 and the eligibility of all European regions, in the period 2007-2013, all regions are eligible for structural funds support."
"Concerning the period post-2013, there is no official Commission position at this stage."
"As regards your third question on the weakening of the principle of additionality, additionality is one of the basic principles of cohesion policy."
"It ensures that the structural funds do not replace the public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State."
"Thus, it guarantees the genuine economic impact of EU interventions and provides cohesion policy with an important European added value."
"As to your question on the regional dimension of cohesion policy after 2013, the Lisbon Treaty maintains the objective of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions as part of the Union's remit on economic, social and territorial cohesion under Article 174."
"In addition, Article 176 points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions."
"As regards your question on the involvement of regional and local levels of governance in the pursuit of European objectives within the framework of post-2013 cohesion policy, once again, I would like to draw your attention to the Commission's consultation paper on the EU 2020 strategy, which looks for the active support of stakeholders, such as the social partners and civil society, and recognises that the take-up of the EU 2020 vision across all the regions of the EU will also be crucial to its success."
"The Commission has not yet developed a position on what role cohesion policy will play in the delivery of the EU 2020 strategy."
"But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives."
"In relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, at the current stage, a separate White Paper on Territorial Cohesion is not foreseen."
"Policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post-2013 prepared in the context of the Fifth Cohesion Report which, according to the new treaty, is due for submission in 2010."
"On your question concerning the role of the European Social Fund in cohesion policy, in pursuing the objective of balanced and sustainable development, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in the delivery of European priorities."
"This is also the case for the European Social Fund, which will continue to pursue its objectives as defined by Title XI of the new treaty."
"Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion requires appropriate policies and a mix of investments from various levels."
"Human capital investments financed by the ESF form an essential component of this policy mix in the context of the global knowledge-based economy."
"With regard to your question on the role of cohesion policy in relation to other EU policies, cohesion policy provides the EU with its largest source of investment in the real economy."
"The December 2008 communication of the Commission on 'Cohesion policy: investing in real economy', underlined the importance of the policy for focusing on the EU Lisbon Agenda delivery, investing in people, business, research and innovation, priority infrastructures and energy."
"The Commission's current focus is on ensuring that the implementation of the planned investments can be delivered in partnership with national and regional authorities as effectively as possible."
"This effort involves close cooperation between relevant Commission services and between the Commission and relevant regional and local authorities."
"A practical example of cooperation between the Commission services is the 'Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation' published in 2007, which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding Community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments."
"As far as the ESF is concerned, the close alignment of its priorities with the Employment Guidelines provides for a direct link between EU employment policy priorities and EU financial support."
"Complementarity also exists between actions supported by the cohesion policy and by the rural development policy as clearly set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines of both policies."
"I hope that I have responded to some of your questions and I look forward to an interesting debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate primarily concerns the substantive assessment of the cohesion policy and the way ahead for this policy."
"Of course, the European Parliament wants a financial mid-term review."
"The cohesion policy and the use of the funds now and in this subsequent period up to 2020 forms a key part of this."
"However, much to our surprise, we found absolutely no mention of a substantive assessment in the 'non-paper' preparatory to the mid-term review."
"I should like to make clear, as the first speaker from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that the new Commission must present the European Parliament with a substantive assessment rather than a caricature of regional policy."
"Commission President Barroso's vision document EU 2020 envisages growth and a knowledge-based economy, equipping and training, competition and a green economy."
"Well, then, regional policy now and in the future constitutes the European integration framework for the realisation of these objectives."
"Look at energy transition, climate change and the Lisbon Strategy: these are all essential elements for regions and cities."
"As far as the PPE Group is concerned, we wish to focus the cohesion policy rather more on the key elements of this EU 2020 strategy, whilst retaining solidarity among all the regions and also Objective 2, about which the Commissioner spoke so vaguely just now."
"The promotion of competition in the rich regions forms part of the comprehensive assessment."
"Splitting budgets, increasing the sectoral fragmentation of funds at European level within the framework of such a mid-term review, serves no purpose whatsoever and is the wrong approach to take."
"In the present times of crisis, we are seeing how important regional funds are to recovery."
"These are being disbursed faster and are being fully utilised: in 2009, virtually 100% has been mobilised for innovation and new objectives in my region, the South Netherlands region."
"In early 2010, I myself shall be issuing a report on the synergy between regional funds and research and development."
"I should like to finish off with a question."
"Commissioner, you say you will not be presenting a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, yet it is Parliament that will be dealing with this by means of the ordinary legislative procedure and ensuring that these things are laid down in the new regulations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013."
"We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago."
"The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable."
"On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy."
"We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union."
"For us, there is no question that we also need to change."
"In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy."
"In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money."
"We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation."
"Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation."
"We also need to concentrate on urban development."
"This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy."
"Our approach is to create stronger networks."
"I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge."
"Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner's response was slightly evasive."
"For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly."
"Life-long learning is an important concept."
"However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy."
"There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy."
"Cross-border cooperation is very important to us."
"We want to strengthen this cooperation at the same time as simplifying the bureaucracy involved."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the reform of the Structural Funds is of fundamental importance in terms of the opportunity for the European Union to have financial instruments which are suitable for the economic situation, along with the relevant natural and human resources."
"We are faced with a tough task in forecasting and devising a cohesion policy which will promote citizens' long-term prosperity."
"This policy was and still is one of the visible quantifiable indicators of European solidarity."
"However, the disparities between some regions are fairly extreme and we must not ignore this fact."
"What is alarming is that trends are being observed indicating that these disparities are growing, which may increase inequality and lead to isolation."
"As a representative of one of the poorest Member States in the European Union, I urge that one of the focuses of the cohesion policy will be cohesion between low-income Member States."
"I note that we are not looking at the Structural Funds as a panacea."
"It is clear to us that we need to join efforts and increase our pace towards achieving the European Union's basic standards."
"We should also warn of the possibility that the fact that countries are moving at different speeds may lead, at a suitable moment, to an internal restructuring of the European Union."
"Above all, we must set criteria, simplified terms and an equal chance of acquiring resources from the EU funds."
"Only after this should a clause be added for reducing the support for countries which fail to make any progress."
"I feel it is appropriate, if some countries encounter difficulties while acting on their own, to have them included in areas and problems with a significantly transnational dimension."
"As a result, European resources will also be allocated to richer countries and their regions with a lower GDP."
"Ultimately, the results of the cohesion policy must also be measured in terms of employment generated."
"This is also an indicator of how it integrates with other policies and ensures added value."
"Mr President, Commissioner, not much has been said about the significance of the European cohesion policy in Europe."
"It lies at the centre of the European Union, as it is the policy which holds the EU together at its heart."
"It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism."
"It is an instrument for all the regions."
"This is why the European Parliament is so concerned that this solidarity mechanism may simply be abolished behind our backs."
"It does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents, instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us, such as climate change and demographic change, given the tight budgetary constraints."
"We need reform, but it must result in genuine change."
"It must bring about sustainable development in the regions."
"It must provide the regions with support for their projects and not consist of top-down policy, in the way that this earmarking mechanism currently does."
"Instead, it must develop a bottom-up process in close partnership with all the players in the regions."
"We are familiar with this process."
"We already have the LEADER method for the development of rural areas."
"This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance."
"However, we need a Commission which is brave enough to say yes to the solidarity mechanism and yes to the regions deciding on their own development, rather than this being the responsibility of national governments."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current cohesion policy is a living organism."
"As Europe changes, the position of individual states and groups changes in respect of this policy."
"Unfortunately, more questions than answers have emerged in discussions over the future of cohesion policy after 2014."
"Will cohesion policy continue to serve mainly the least developed regions of the Union?"
"Will we have the opportunity to construct transport and technical infrastructure in the coming period?"
"Will we manage to improve quality of life and make savings?"
"Will we manage to reduce the bureaucracy and excessive administration connected with the drawing of EU funding?"
"We will be looking for consensual answers to these and other questions in the very near future."
"From the perspective of future developments, I personally consider it vital firstly to align the role of local authorities correctly in managing European funds and secondly, to target European funds at supporting the use of modern technologies."
"It is precisely these two areas that are combined in the so-called Smart Cities initiative, which offers an opportunity to revitalise municipal authorities and, at the same time, to offer the business sector the opportunity in a period of economic crisis to apply modern systems and intelligent technologies and to generate economic growth."
"This is unquestionably a reason for focusing strategic investments on this area not only at a local authority level but also at a Member State and even EU level."
"Intelligent transport systems that can liberate cities from transport chaos, supportive navigation mechanisms that can increase the attractiveness of tourism in cities, and teleassistance systems enabling senior citizens to remain longer in their own homes are all types of investment that should be given the green light."
"As a result of the economic crisis, our debate on the future of the cohesion policy has become even more urgent than it ever was in the past."
"Today, we must think twice before deciding where to direct European funds."
"Mr President, the European Union's cohesion policy has not only failed to reduce regional and social inequalities, but it has also helped to exacerbate them."
"The values given in statistics are often fictitious, as the European Union itself admits, which is why it created the transitional support regime for a series of regions, three of which are in my country, Greece."
"The rule of unequal development in the capitalist system is implacable, especially in times of crisis, during which contrasts are even more marked."
"Unfortunately, forecasts for 2013 are even worse for the workers, especially in less developed areas."
"The European Union's cohesion policy tries to gloss over this anti-grassroots policy, to buy people off, to disorientate the workers and, more importantly, to secure the profitability of capital."
"The aim of temporarily ironing out the contrasts between sections of the plutocracy, misleadingly referred to as 'solidarity', is now being replaced by the rule of competition and the free market."
"These elements also exist in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU strategy for 2020."
"It calls for new forms of regional and local governance, as proposed in Greece by the PASOK and New Democracy parties, extended and more direct intervention by the European Union in regional bodies and differentiated territorial cooperation which will also cross national borders."
"We call on the workers to reject this policy."
"Finally, I should like to take advantage of my speaking time to call on you, Mr President, to exert your influence in obtaining satisfaction in the European Parliament of the just demands of the workers, who are taking to the streets."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, regarding post-2013 cohesion policy, a leaked draft budgetary document entitled 'A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe' reveal that EU funding from 2013 onwards could change entirely to a nationally coordinated rather than regionally allocated distribution."
"The draft abandons regional and local level control in multi-level governance, overturning the shared management principle."
"Instead, a sectoral approach to the new budget is adopted rather than operating independently within current structures."
"The proposal to limit the policy to national level would lead to qualifying Member States governing redistribution."
"Not only does this mean that net contributors will lose further return funding, but those Member States expected to join the European Union under future expansion would enter membership under cohesion funding likely to remain for the forthcoming budgetary duration."
"As a result, those countries who currently shoulder a large proportion of the Union's financial burden, like the UK, will discover they must finance an ever-increasing pool of Member States qualifying for support."
"Even fewer will have to carry even more, with a possible loss of the rebate for the UK."
"With more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am concerned Wales will see much needed support go to newer Member States."
"It is no surprise that some of Europe's richest countries like Norway and Switzerland have given the European Union a wide berth, knowing that they would be paying to fund their poorer neighbours."
"But Wales cannot afford to pay if nothing is paid back out."
"The move reinforces the European Union's increasing ambition to become further integrated, centralised and federal, yet abandons the regional dimension of cohesion policy which underpins the European Union's pledge to support territorial cohesion and deliver benefits to all members."
"Instead the EU, like a wolf in sheep's clothing, is covertly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation."
"Whereas the people of Europe were told the Union - on the grounds that it enhanced trade links - strengthened agriculture ties and promoted equality, the machinations of an increasing bureaucratic global Europe see the focus on farming and regional development decrease in favour of an unwanted ambitious global strategy, including increased emigration to countries like the UK."
"Larger shares of the EU budget will need to be devoted to such an agenda at the expense of regions such as Wales."
"The last payments to projects under the 2007-2013 EU structural funds programmes will be made in 2015."
"There is uncertainty over what, if any, subsequent EU funding will be available to Wales in future funding rounds."
"The implication that cohesion might disappear entirely from richer nations with no mention at all of transitional funding would further disenfranchise the people of the UK."
"The disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through self-sufficiency determined by the UK itself."
"The EU budget review set to be published in the spring will likely see every government in Europe declare the necessity for increased public sector borrowing."
"It seems increasingly likely that the level of funding available to Wales will reduce substantially."
"The consequences will include reductions in programme budgets, less investment in the wider economy in Wales, and broad-reaching loss of jobs connected to programme management and project delivery."
"Rather than having any sort of beneficial effect on my constituents, the EU will serve a glancing blow to the people of Wales if they decide to pull the rug from under our feet."
"The likely result of the reduction in funding to Wales and the UK will have a major impact on our country as a whole which will affect the farming sector as well."
"It now must be time that the people of Wales and the UK have a referendum on its relations with the European Union so the people can decide if they want to be governed by Westminster or Brussels."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just imagine for a moment the European regions without the European regional policy."
"Many towns and rural regions would lack decisive incentives for structural change."
"The border regions with their problems of cross-border workers and cross-border infrastructure would simply be neglected."
"Social policy would no longer be able to benefit from European contributions to education and employment policy."
"Medium-sized companies would be prevented from taking part successfully in international networks."
"Without European regional policy, the communities in the regions would no longer be visible."
"For this reason, we are very annoyed by the signals coming from the Commission which include proposals for social programmes without the support of structural funding."
"This would turn the Commission into a social monopoly without the regions or would lead to calls for subsidy policy only for the weakest in our society."
"This, in turn, would mean that we would completely lose sight of the European context and we would return to the age of renationalisation."
"Whether or not the Commission has now made these documents public, the European Parliament will not lend its support to the move that they describe to a regional policy without the regions."
"This does not mean that we are closed to the idea of reform."
"New challenges relating to the environment, to energy policy or to demographic change must be integrated into our existing subsidy structures."
"I am also in favour of making it easier to measure the European contribution to the regions."
"We must also impose stricter sanctions on the Member States which consistently fail to demonstrate that they are managing the funds properly."
"More regional cofinancing, more loans, more transparency and more efficiency: these are the types of proposals we would like to see for the reform of the cohesion policy."
"We will support proposals of this kind, but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy."
"Reforms yes, renationalisation no!"
"(EL) Mr President, I agree with the members who have spoken so far and I, too, should like to point out that we cannot accept a post-2013 cohesion policy which, firstly, will distinguish between the regions of the Europe with proposals such as abolishing Objective 2 (competitiveness); secondly, will include the renationalisation of policies; and, thirdly, will exclude local authorities from the programming and implementation of Community policies."
"On the contrary, we envision a post-2013 cohesion policy, a period in which there will still be a common European policy applied to all regions of the European Union, that will continue to have adequate funds to achieve its objective and will have simplified application rules so that it acquires even greater added value."
"I am concerned about the contents of the document for the 2020 strategy, because there is no reference to cohesion policy, which is the most appropriate tool for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"In fact, a large part of cohesion policy is already serving these objectives and will prove its added value."
"Also, important proof of its significance is that cohesion policy has spearheaded the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"There is one development policy, one solidarity policy, one policy for every European citizen regardless of the region of the European Union where they are living."
"Unfortunately, however, in the European Commission, they forget this or they appear to ignore it and they process proposals that change the principles and form of cohesion policy."
"However, you can be sure that we shall take every opportunity to remind them."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, funding for the regions and structural funding form part of our practical economic policy and make Europe widely visible."
"In local authority areas, towns and municipalities in the regions, different players are working closely together."
"For this reason, we must retain this integrated approach for the entire European Union."
"I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy."
"We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised."
"These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, as far as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is concerned, cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the European Union: solidarity."
"Europe becomes stronger whenever European solidarity is shown."
"This is a fundamental issue for us."
"The European Commission must, in our view, integrate the following principles."
"Firstly, since territorial cohesion is a political priority, it should therefore also be a budgetary priority."
"Secondly, the region is the appropriate level of partnership for a regional development policy."
"Renationalising this policy would be unacceptable for us."
"Thirdly, cohesion must also be used to reduce the most serious economic and social disparities within a territory for the benefit of deprived urban areas or rural areas that are in difficulty or which receive very few services on account of structural handicaps, as is the case with islands, for example."
"Lastly, the eligibility of all EU regions to benefit from cohesion policy must be judged on an individual basis, of course, according to their level of wealth, but the European Union must be able to make its contribution whenever cohesion policies are at stake."
"(DE) Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union."
"The choice is between the market and social policy."
"The Commission's current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable."
"The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened."
"Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development."
"I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany."
"After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased."
"In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised."
"The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions."
"Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis."
"I would like to say one last word about the border regions."
"As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there."
"I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect."
"(DE) Mr President, you will probably have heard in the meantime that there is serious consternation and disquiet among the members of the Committee on Regional Development, because a so-called secret document from the Commission has been circulating since October."
"This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy."
"The original regional focus of the budget has been replaced by a sectoral approach."
"The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance, which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy."
"In specific terms, the draft includes plans to abolish Objective 2, in other words, competitiveness and employment policy."
"As there are Objective 2 regions in every Member State, this would, of course, sadly affect two thirds of all the EU regions."
"This unfortunate proposal is justified on the basis that the difference between new - or in other words, future - Member States and Western Europe at a national level is so great that a new budget policy is needed."
"In the light of the financial crisis, this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy."
"It seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of Turkey."
"We know that increased funding would be needed and this is a way of planning to ensure that the huge amounts of money required for the accession will be available."
"However, I would like to say quite clearly that at a regional level, the success of the cohesion policy lies in its proximity to local economic problems."
"As a result, money will be invested sensibly and efficiently, as it has been until now."
"If the regional component is not included, it will not be possible to bring an end to the economic crisis."
"I was not convinced by Mr Barroso's answer to Mrs Hübner's open letter, which indicated her concern, and, therefore, I expect to see a concrete statement soon."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group clearly supports a strong and well-financed cohesion policy that can promote the convergence of Europe's regions."
"Indeed, we believe that, to be effective, this policy must be reformed and enhanced."
"We, Parliament and the European Commission, must design this policy together, with maximum transparency."
"I welcome the creation, by Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, of a working group on the future of cohesion policy."
"Consultation on the post-2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all the actors concerned: the Member States, the regions, the European Commission and Parliament."
"It is inconceivable to weaken, or indeed abolish, the regional and local levels that give full meaning to this policy."
"Where financing in particular is concerned, we are today faced with great uncertainty regarding the future of this cohesion policy."
"The expiry date of the current financial framework is uncertain, as is the extent of the reform of the financial perspective."
"The importance of maintaining stability in the financing of this policy must be remembered."
"It is also crucial to reject any idea of renationalising cohesion policy, since this would deprive the regions of the choice of how to share out the Structural Funds and would destroy the regional dimension of this policy."
"We expect an unmistakably proactive attitude from the Commission concerning the preparation of a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, Commissioner."
"With regard to the distribution of these funds, we do not want egalitarianism but financial equity, and we want this in conjunction with a form of harmonious development that is based on findings and on situations that vary according to territory."
"Cohesion policy must not just focus on the most impoverished regions; it must be aimed at all of Europe's regions, including those overseas."
"It is vitally important for Parliament to have clearly identified local contact points."
"That is the price - the only price - at which the European Structural Funds will be distributed fairly and effectively."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sending a greeting to all the social organisations present in Copenhagen, hoping for a positive outcome for the future of the planet and for the future of global cohesion."
"We must defend cohesion policy as a Community policy that is a bulwark against attempts at renationalisation."
"This is necessary not only because of its direct impact on the development of cohesion across our regions and Member States, but also because of its added value in terms of strategic planning, financial stability and the visibility of the European project."
"At the same time, it is important to bear in mind the vital role the regions play and must play in cohesion policy."
"Decentralised management and good governance at various levels are crucial to ensuring the success of regional development policy."
"The establishment of transition mechanisms providing for a smooth transition in those regions and countries where intervention is gradually being reduced within the framework of the so-called convergence objective and the Cohesion Fund is another matter of concern to me."
"So, too, is the development of European regions that have to cope with natural difficulties, including the peculiarities of border regions."
"(PT) Mr President, we have been extremely concerned to witness all the developments surrounding the reform of the budget, particularly in relation to the structural and cohesion policy."
"In a crisis marked by huge social inequalities and regional asymmetries, the structural and cohesion policy is a basic factor for effective economic and social cohesion."
"That means maintaining tight objectives in this area and not attempting to nationalise the costs of Community policies in either agriculture or fisheries, which would harm less developed countries and regions as well as outermost regions."
"There are various signs, however, that moves are afoot to subvert the cohesion concept even further, either by trying to make it include and finance all kinds of actions and actors that have no connection with cohesion objectives - especially the European Union's strategy for 2020 and climate change policy - or by changing eligibility and management criteria."
"This debate on the cohesion policy after 2013 is therefore much needed."
"We look forward to obtaining clear responses in support of a genuine economic and social cohesion policy."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need a debate on the Community budget and how to improve its sustainability and transparency in future."
"The post-2013 financial framework must be built on the basis of solidarity and territorial cohesion."
"These are crucial values for regions like Madeira, which face permanent difficulties and therefore require permanent support."
"I should like to share with you a few ideas that I think should always be present when we think about and develop our cohesion policy."
"On a number of occasions, the Commission has mentioned certain aspects that I believe are essential, such as the need for this policy to be more flexible, simpler, more efficient and more results-oriented in its definition and implementation."
"There are, however, issues that cause me some concern, particularly with regard to the needs of the outermost regions."
"I should like to make three brief remarks in this respect."
"Firstly, the current regional approach should prevail over alternative criteria, such as added-value sectors."
"Such a change could jeopardise Objective 2, which currently benefits roughly two thirds of the European regions, as well as being potentially counterproductive in regions with highly specific economic profiles and competitive advantages."
"Secondly, I believe it is vital to maintain the proximity criterion in the cohesion policy."
"Priority should still be given to allocating and managing the Structural Funds from a regional standpoint and not from a national or even a centralised European one."
"For my third and final point, but one that is no less important, I should like to highlight Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which provides for special treatment for the outermost regions with regard to access to structural funds, precisely because of their economic and social situation compounded by permanent and unique constraints and characteristics, which reveal themselves in their constant difficulties and therefore require the permanent aid that is sought."
"(PL) Mr President, the cohesion policy is, today, contributing to the development of road and rail infrastructure, principally in the new Member States."
"Thanks to the policy, many new jobs have been created, and more will doubtless be created in the next few years."
"Investments related to environment protection are also extremely important."
"When evaluating the policy and its effectiveness to date, it is worth answering a basic question: what will happen after 2013?"
"The European Parliament should say clearly that there is no consensus on rationalisation of the cohesion policy."
"After 2013, as well as its traditional activities and mechanisms, the cohesion policy should support research, science, development, innovativeness, job creation and the fight with global warming."
"The cohesion policy should also include rural areas to a greater degree."
"It is important that realisation of the cohesion policy be based on regions and macroregions."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly about three matters: equality of rights and status, secrecy and, last but not least, the importance of rural development."
"Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and 20 years after our fellow Member, László Tőkés, broke through the wall of silence at the start of the Romanian revolution in Temesvár (Timişoara) in Transylvania, it has been said more than once that in the 21st century, we no longer have old and new Member States in the European Union, but a single European Union."
"I fully agree with this statement, which is, of course, very general, but I feel it is important that it does not only appear as part of token decisions, but also features in the everyday application of the cohesion policy, one of the European Union's most important common policies."
"If the European Union's Member States enjoy equal rights and status, it is inconceivable that the cohesion policy should be reformed in such a way that the European Union Member States who joined in 2004 and 2007 lose out in the new cohesion policy."
"Such a reform is simply unimaginable."
"My second point is about secrecy."
"It is a ridiculous state of affairs where the European Commission either pronounces some meaningless statements on the cohesion policy's future or says absolutely nothing at all on the subject."
"As an MEP and a member of the relevant European Parliament committee, I would expect the European Commission to adopt a clear, unambiguous position on these matters."
"Last but not least, I want to talk about rural development."
"I firmly believe that rural development must continue to be a crucial aspect of the cohesion policy."
"Suitable resources need to be allocated to rural development policy."
"Based on the technical position adopted by the European Council of Municipalities and Regions, I think it is important for us to think through the possibility of integrating rural development policy with the cohesion policy after 2013."
"(PT) The cohesion policy is the European Union's main instrument for ensuring that all European citizens have an equal chance of success wherever they live."
"It contributes decisively to creating a European sense of belonging and is one of the most successful and effective European development policies."
"Commissioner, I cannot hide my concern at the Commission's now famous 'Non-Paper' and its proposals."
"We do not accept the renationalisation of the cohesion policy, which would, in practice, come to an end if its effectiveness depended on each Member State's wealth."
"I sincerely hope that the Commission will abandon that path once and for all."
"As you are aware, Commissioner, the new Article 349 of the Treaty establishes the need for European policies to be adjusted to the special characteristics of the outermost regions, particularly to mitigate their handicaps, but also to make good use of their potential."
"What ideas can you give us on the future strategy for the outermost regions that the Commission is to publish during 2010?"
"Mr President, like my colleagues, I, too, have been concerned by some of the trends outlined in the internal document which, in the grand old scheme of things, was leaked recently."
"The area that is causing me most concern is the suggestion to deprioritise the competitiveness objectives."
"These competitiveness objectives have been vital in creating rural and regional development - particularly the technology parks, which have helped to drive the smart economy and will be needed more so into the future."
"They have also helped with cohesion within, as well as across, regions."
"I think it is very important to realise that there are huge poverty gaps within regions."
"This is not always recognised, and I think in particular the criterion of basing everything on national GDP is an erroneous measurement."
"It should be more on purchasing power, and certainly the purchasing power within some regions is far lower than the national average."
"I hope these things will be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper, as well as the opportunities that exist in synergies between research, innovation and regional development."
"Like my colleague, I, too, would be concerned about rural development policy - albeit not as part of the cohesion policy, more in line with the CAP - but, at the same time, it is absolutely vital that it is not squeezed in any future proposals because rural development, and particularly the family farm, is vital for the social infrastructure of society."
"Finally, I just want to say also that more needs to be done in combating fraud."
"I know there have been improvements in recent years, but we must ensure that the money which is given by the EU goes to where it is supposed to go, so that we can have better opportunities for people right across the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, Podkarpacie - the region I represent - is a region of wonderful, ambitious, hard-working people, a place where many energetic businesses operate."
"New initiatives are appearing, such as Aviation Valley, but at the same time, Podkarpacie is one of the most poorly developed areas in the European Union."
"Our problems are not the result of a lack of willingness, but of structural and infrastructural limitations, which, with the help of a variety of programmes, we are trying to eliminate."
"I would like to stress that, as part of our efforts, we are not asking for charity, but for support for our initiatives."
"We, too, want the competitiveness of the European economy to rise, and we want solutions which will help protect our climate."
"However, we also want the change in priority of financing to be gradual, not sudden, because that would mean leaving the weakest regions to look after themselves."
"It is very important that the cohesion policy be realised by the regions, because such a solution brings the best effects."
"I would also like to note that the cohesion policy carries with it a very important message for the citizens."
"It shows that Europe is united and that it is worth participating in this exceptional project."
"(DE) Mr President, the regional structural funding is an important tool for European integration and the Objective 2 funding in particular has, in the past, been seen as an engine for local structural and economic development by the people in many regions."
"It is an important means of managing structural change in the regions and in local authority areas."
"This allows citizens to experience Europe at first hand, because the funding has a local impact."
"However, we need simpler, clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds, so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently."
"Cohesion, or the convergence of social and economic development, is a major objective of the EU and, therefore, it is important that this instrument is strengthened rather than weakened in future."
"The cohesion policy in Europe needs more clarity, more transparency and more efficiency."
"The individual Member States must also take more responsibility in this area."
"This is why it is important to retain the system of additionality in funding."
"We do not want structural funding to be renationalised."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 2013."
"Mr President, Wales is probably the most positively European area in the UK, and the reason for that is that every community, almost every individual and many organisations benefit from European funding, formerly Objective 1 and now convergence funding."
"Therefore, if the proposals suggested by the Commission are brought forward, I believe it would have huge political consequences in areas like Wales."
"It would also, of course, have huge economic, financial and social consequences for those regions."
"Therefore, I think it is absolutely vital that all Members of this Parliament urge the Commission to bring forward proposals which are acceptable to us - and by that I mean proposals which would allow every region across Europe that qualifies, to access structural funds - and also to ensure that those areas ceasing to be eligible for convergence funding after 2013 also have some transitional status in the future."
"So, Mr Gollnisch, you have finally arrived."
"I am going to give you the floor, but you have just one minute."
"(FR) Mr President, I have, in any case, listened very carefully to all of my fellow Members' speeches."
"I think that two main points have come out of these speeches."
"The first is the secrecy surrounding the Commission's mysterious 'non-document', and that is why we are eagerly awaiting the Commission's explanations."
"The second is this rather strange attitude whereby territorial cohesion policy is apparently being redefined on the basis of completely new priorities, which seem to have very little in common with cohesion itself."
"I am thinking in particular of the issue of foreign policy, which we are well aware is a priority for the High Representative, but which is obviously much less of a priority in this area."
"As for the common agricultural policy, unfortunately, it has already been sacrificed to a great extent to market forces."
"Therefore, we believe that it would be extremely helpful if the Commission could give us a much clearer idea of what its objectives are from now on."
"Lastly, global warming does not seem to me to come under cohesion policy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the concerns of many of my fellow Members."
"I strongly believe that GDP returning to barely positive growth rates such as those forecast for 2010 will not mark the end of the economic crisis we are experiencing."
"We will only be able to consider it actually over when employment has returned to pre-crisis levels."
"The most optimistic estimates put this time at around 2010."
"In this context, it is necessary to implement an investment policy and it is vital in strategic terms that Objective 2, or something similar, is maintained, since it represents an effective instrument for helping our regions overcome the crisis."
"Maintaining Objective 2 is in the interests of Italy and of many other European countries, since it fulfils an essential need: development of lagging regions and strengthening of the competitiveness of the most developed regions."
"In view of these arguments, Commissioner, Mr President, do you not think that your abandonment is extremely harmful for the regions of Italy, Europe and the Mediterranean and also for other countries?"
"(DE) Mr President, all or at least the majority of the speakers are talking about the European social model, but this is not reflected sufficiently in the EU budget or in the cohesion policy."
"Therefore, I would like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) which is separate from the European structural policy."
"More funding should be allocated to the ESF and it should become more flexible."
"It should also be possible to increase the funding available during the seven-year finance period."
"By separating the social fund from structural policy, it will be possible to make sufficient funding available to those regions which are not economically underdeveloped and have therefore largely been ignored by EU structural fund policy."
"The European Social Fund should therefore be used more effectively to combat problems on the labour market, such as high levels of unemployment, low employment rates for women, large numbers of early school leavers and low levels of further education."
"(EL) Mr President, I consider that our parliamentary committee took a very important decision for today's debate, which is proving to be extremely interesting, with so many issues and very important dimensions being raised which relate not only to an effective post-2013 cohesion policy, but also to the character of the European Union."
"I should like to point out that this debate, this concern, is being formulated at a very strange time for the European Union."
"On the one hand, we have a positive step towards integration with the Treaty of Lisbon and, on the other, we are still experiencing the consequences of an unprecedented international financial crisis in which we all understood how important the solidarity of the European Union is in supporting the internal market and cohesion."
"I should like to ask the European Commission about two issues which are worrying the European Parliament, on which I share my fellow members' concern."
"Firstly, is there any intention in your plans for innovative proposals, which we are happy to accept, of renationalising Community cohesion policy and, secondly, what is to happen with Objective 2, because this is actually what is needed for the competitiveness, not only of certain areas, but ultimately of the entire European market."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that the job of Parliament and of the European Union is to establish the basic conditions to allow people from all the Member States to have the best possible quality of life in the regions in which they live."
"However, these conditions vary widely throughout Europe."
"This is why we need a strong and adequately funded cohesion policy."
"We must strongly reject any proposals that involve leaving our chosen path and we have heard today that some have been made."
"We do not need renationalisation."
"We need funding instruments for all the European regions, including those which are disadvantaged and those which already have high levels of development."
"We must not put at risk what has already been achieved."
"We need a transparent subsidy system which allows for easy access to funding, but also ensures that the money is used correctly and efficiently."
"We must think on a European level, but act on a regional level."
"(RO) I find this debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2013 particularly useful."
"Nowadays, especially during this crisis, the differences between the levels of development in Europe's various regions are considerable and are continuing to grow."
"Local regions in Europe need to continue with the cohesion policy in order to achieve the proposed objectives."
"The disparities between the different regions must be reduced at a faster pace, without delay."
"The involvement of the regional and local levels of governance must definitely grow, but without these regions necessarily feeling that they are gradually being forgotten and abandoned."
"Many countries in the European Union base their development efforts and national economic policy on the cohesion policy objectives as well."
"My country, Romania, also thinks that it would be particularly useful to continue with the current cohesion policy after 2013 as well, combining efforts and national funds with those offered by the Structural Funds and finances at regional level."
"(EL) Mr President, I agree that regional policy is the lever for better cohesion and solidarity in the Community."
"The present international economic crisis has bared its teeth."
"It has caused numerous inequalities and pressures, especially among vulnerable groups."
"It has increased unemployment, inequalities and social upheaval at national and regional level."
"However, the present global economic crisis is also a challenge."
"Community solidarity urgently needs to be strengthened in order to achieve a proper, integrated European regional cohesion policy which will set high priorities and safeguard proper infrastructures and closer cross-border cooperation through exchanges of best practices."
"We say 'no' to discrimination, 'no' to renationalisation, 'no' to bureaucracy, 'no' to a lack of transparency, 'no' to the secret disposal of funds and the abolition of Objective 2, which will harm Southern Europe and the Mediterranean."
"We say 'yes' to the fair distribution of Community funds, to the participation of local authorities, to the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises, to proper reform, which must be carried out so that there is proper funding of actions in keeping with the objectives of Europe for 2010."
"Finally, we say 'yes' to special treatment for remote areas, especially in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, the rise of multi-level governance has resulted in an increasing need for coordinating mechanisms and platforms, and local authorities often find themselves having to address social disparities caused by developments of policies over which they have no control and little influence."
"Moreover, it is very difficult to estimate the long-term effects of projects financed by European funds and the impact of programmes which are implemented at the same time."
"I would like to know how the European Commission intends to support the efforts of local authorities to generate an integrated and sustainable development strategy based on the needs of the communities and taking into account the needs which could be influenced by external causes."
"What instruments will be developed by the European Commission for local authorities?"
"(PL) Mr President, cohesion policy is a pillar of development policy."
"It is, indeed, this policy which contributes most to strengthening the identity of regions and local society."
"In my opinion, we go to two extremes here."
"Some would like to put a bit too much into the policy, while others want to restrict it too much."
"Surely, the most important objective of the policy is sustainable development in a variety of areas."
"Cohesion policy must be the same for both urban and rural areas."
"Let us remember that the Union, after such a major enlargement, is greatly differentiated."
"Ensuring equal opportunities for development is an important task."
"Contemporary challenges, which we have to face up to at the same time, are the fight against the economic crisis, the unfavourable demographic trend and, finally, climate change."
"One thing is certain: there is a need to continue the cohesion policy and to adapt it to the present challenges."
"(RO) I would like to add to what my fellow Member said by saying that when we talk about intelligent cities, it is important for us to invest more in energy efficiency in residential buildings."
"90% of the buildings which will exist in 2020 already exist now."
"This is why I am asking for the future cohesion policy to increase the European Regional Development Fund allocation so that it can be used by Member States to improve energy efficiency in buildings, especially homes."
"I also think that we need to invest more in public transport to develop urban mobility."
"(EL) Mr President, my fellow Members have covered the basic issues of today's debate."
"I should just like to highlight two issues."
"Firstly, it is unacceptable for the preconditions to be met and for the facility to exist for taking advantage of our cohesion policies and programmes and for this to ultimately be unfeasible for operational and, more importantly, bureaucratic reasons."
"Therefore, the more we simplify our procedures and policies, the closer we shall be to what we are striving for, namely cohesion in Europe."
"Secondly, we have said that we are, in any case, coming out of the economic crisis which has affected the whole of Europe and the entire world at the moment."
"If we want to be optimistic, we obviously have to strengthen the areas with the greatest need and, more importantly, if I may say so - and I should like a reply from the Commission here - the social groups in greatest need of support."
"I am referring here, above all, to young people."
"This is our basic position and that of our political group on the social market economy."
"This is the only way we can face the future with certainty."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, there is no doubt that the cohesion policy will be closely involved in the realisation of the EU 2020 Strategy."
"The EU 2020 Strategy will respond to numerous global challenges, and the cohesion policy will be among the key and fundamental instruments at the disposal of the European Union and Member States to address these challenges."
"Therefore, concerns that cohesion policy will be detached from the implementation of EU overall strategy are unfounded."
"Secondly, the Commission does not have clear answers at this stage to many of the questions and issues raised by honourable Members, such as on geographical coverage, the coverage or existence of Objective 2 regions, the appropriate funding base, transitional arrangements, or the status of individual groups of regions."
"I admit this, but there is an ongoing vivid and deep debate among Commission services, as well as between the governmental experts from the Member States and the Commission."
"These debates will lead to the preparation of a fully-fledged Commission position in autumn 2010."
"In the course of the coming months, the questions and problems raised here should find proper responses from the Commission."
"Finally, I would like to thank all honourable Members for their questions and suggestions."
"They confirm the importance of the cohesion policy as an instrument of long-term investment in areas which are necessary for building the growth potential of European regions and Member States."
"I will take your interesting and valuable comments back with me to Brussels, and I will report about them to my colleagues in the Commission services and to my successor."
"The Commission will be ready to continue discussions with Parliament related to the shape of future cohesion policy in the forthcoming months."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is of paramount importance."
"Given that we are dealing with a horizontal policy which redistributes more than a third of the EU's budget, the results from achieving the cohesion objectives have a crucial bearing on the continent's future."
"Since its inception, the cohesion policy has achieved spectacular successes in the EU15."
"Unfortunately, more active intervention is required in the Member States which have recently joined and are affected by extreme poverty."
"In addition, the situation is made even more difficult by new, strong challenges, such as climate change, the declining population or the global economic recession."
"Consequently, we must deal in the future with the territorial differences in social and economic indicators within a more effective and flexible framework."
"Strong emphasis must also be focused on the development of the least developed areas, especially small regions falling behind the regional average and struggling with far more severe disadvantages than even other areas surrounding them."
"With this purpose in mind, it would be worth considering earmarking resources at EU level, aimed specifically at bringing LAU 1 (formerly NUTS 4) planning-statistical regions into line where the decision about the use of these resources can be made by the relevant small regions or their associations."
"Coordination with the EU's other policies must also be improved."
"The barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved."
"The implementation rules must also be greatly simplified."
"Furthermore, priority must be given to investments relating to education, vocational training and sustainable employment, and to the implementation of comprehensive programmes tailored to the small regions' individual needs."
"The Europe of the regions is a principle on which the EU has long agreed."
"The cohesion policy after 2013 must continue to make this vision a reality."
"One good approach is to make territorial cohesion the main objective."
"In this context, interregional cooperation plays an important role."
"In recent decades, the interregional approach has had some significant successes."
"The various EU projects in this area allow citizens to experience Europe directly and bring the freedom of action characteristic of European policy down to a regional level."
"However, there is still work to be done in the future."
"An interregional approach requires effective coordination to bring the different structures in the different countries into line."
"Other important cornerstones of regional policy in the years to come will be additionality in funding, cross-sectoral cooperation and conditionality."
"In order to ensure that the funding reaches the areas where it is needed, projects must have clear and specific objectives."
"In my opinion, careful long-term planning also brings added value and prevents funds from being wasted."
"I fear the provisions put forward by the Commission - especially those concerning the ending of Objective 2 and abandonment of the regional aspect of cohesion policy in favour of a sectoral approach - may mean a return to the concept of a two-speed Europe and an increase in the distance, in terms of economy and civilisation, between the old and the new Europe."
"Such a model would be a departure from integration of the entire 27 and from the idea of solidarity enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That idea, surely, lies at the root of the entire cohesion policy, which is intended to bring about equalisation of opportunities and elimination of differences between regions."
"The proposal of the Commission concerning increasing the emphasis on research and the development of new technologies should be praised."
"This is the route which Europe needs."
"In choosing this, we must not, however, forget those regions and countries where bringing the standard of living up to the EU average is a fundamental matter."
"Please remember that between the richest and poorest areas of the EU there is a greater than 11 times difference in wealth."
"Eliminating these differences must continue to be the main principle of EU cohesion policy."
"A new version of the document is currently being written."
"I hope that in the new version, the Commission will take account of the words which were said during today's debate, and of what is being said in various parts of the European Union and at various levels: local governments, governments, associations and non-governmental organisations."
"Good regional policy can be achieved only with close cooperation from the regions."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.05 and resumed at 11.30)"
"I have one announcement to make."
"It concerns a lady who has supported us in the European Parliament for many years - Mrs Birgitte Stensballe."
"She is, unfortunately, leaving us, and will retire on 1 January 2010."
"(The House accorded Mrs Stensballe a standing ovation)"
"Agenda"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise two points of order and I would like to be able to raise them one after another."
"Firstly, I have a request for the entire House."
"It refers to an urgent matter which we will be discussing this afternoon."
"This is the case of Aminatou Haidar."
"We have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon."
"I would ask my fellow Members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process."
"Some Members who have been closely involved with this case know - and I cannot give any more details at this point, but I am one of those who knows - that we will have a solution for this case during the course of the day."
"Prominent government representatives from the EU are working to achieve a positive solution."
"Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels."
"This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be."
"That was my first request, Mr President."
"The second request will follow immediately."
"Mr Schulz, I am not certain we can discuss this point again."
"I am afraid it is already too late, because we made a decision on this matter earlier."
"It is difficult, now, to discuss this point again."
"(FR) Mr President, I support Mr Schulz's proposal."
"I believe that the negotiations are extremely difficult."
"We are talking about a case that concerns a human being, a woman, and efforts are under way to find a political solution."
"I therefore believe that, when efforts are under way to find a political solution, it is important not to exacerbate the situation."
"I ask that we first be allowed to find a political solution."
"(Applause)"
"(PT) I would just like to make a brief point."
"The diplomatic efforts are very important, but Aminatou Haidar is on her 33rd day of hunger strike in hospital."
"The worst thing we could do would be to tell a woman who is fighting for basic human rights that this Parliament was going to forget her here and now."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, we can vote on the proposal to remove this from the order of business."
"In relation to this, I would like someone to speak in favour of the motion."
"(ES) In my capacity as leader of the Spanish Socialist delegation to the European Parliament, I should like to express my appreciation of the words spoken by the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supported by the President of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I do so for two reasons."
"Firstly, because as I see it, this House is clearly demonstrating its solidarity with Mrs Haidar personally and with her cause in this dangerous situation resulting from a prolonged hunger strike."
"My second reason is that I believe the House is also adopting a positive stance in support of the intense multilateral diplomatic effort led by the government of the Kingdom of Spain."
"This is, after all, the government of the country on whose territory Mrs Haidar is currently to be found."
"It is also the government of the country in which the hunger strike is taking place that Mrs Haidar herself has stated will not end until she returns to a territory that is not under Spanish jurisdiction."
"I therefore support the current diplomatic effort, and believe that our best course of action would be to avoid a resolution that could compromise the success of any negotiations that might take place in the next few hours..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Now I will ask for someone to speak against the motion."
"(ES) Mr President, I am taking the floor to voice my group's opposition to this proposal, and I shall now explain our reasons."
"I do not think it is appropriate to present such a proposal this morning."
"Furthermore, it would amount to a failure to respect all the parliamentary groups that have tabled the text of a resolution."
"We devoted three hours, only yesterday, to finding a way of taking this matter out of the political debate and ceasing to focus on what is happening in Spain."
"Thanks to the efforts of all the groups involved, we succeeded in reconciling differing positions and arriving at a common text for a resolution."
"We were also able to overcome differences of opinion in the same meeting."
"Consequently, I believe that if it is deemed inappropriate, if this House does not make its voice heard on such a situation, when will it actually make itself heard?"
"When will that be?"
"(Loud applause)"
"I have one final request ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, it is not right to say that the House has expressed a view on the case of Mrs Haidar."
"That has not happened."
"The House was going to express its view today."
"It was going to do so today, after a hunger strike that has lasted 33 days, yet an attempt is being made to prevent us from debating the matter."
"I think this is immoral."
"I repeat, it is utterly immoral."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, I asked for the floor to make a point of order."
"This House is irrevocably committed to the cause of human rights and duty bound to honour that obligation."
"Mr Schulz made a proposal to the House this morning."
"If he is privy to data or important information relevant to Mrs Haidar's case, he should make that information available to the House."
"A decision should then be taken in plenary this afternoon at the start of the debate."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, for many years, I was responsible for human rights debates in this House on behalf of my group."
"I am dealing with this case with great care."
"I would like to mention that I had a very long discussion about this case with the Moroccan foreign minister last Sunday."
"I have the impression that there is the possibility today of ending Mrs Haidar's hunger strike and finding a solution for her."
"If I had the impression that a public statement would help to resolve this case, I would make a public statement."
"However, because I believe that in complicated diplomatic cases of this kind, discretion is the best way of solving the problem, I would ask my fellow Members to use the necessary discretion to ensure that this lady is saved."
"That is my only wish."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you for a moment's attention."
"We cannot continue discussion on this matter indefinitely."
"(ES) Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my surprise, given that, as Mrs Bilbao Barandica pointed out, we devoted almost three hours to debating this matter yesterday."
"If Mr Schulz has been in possession of relevant information concerning this matter since Sunday, we should have been informed accordingly yesterday."
"I repeat, the information should have been passed to us yesterday, before the joint resolution was debated."
"We should have been aware of this information when talks were held between the different groups, leading to an agreement, that is to say, to a compromise."
"(FR) No, that is not true."
"We have a responsibility to adopt a resolution, at least so that we may know this House's position on the case of Aminatou Haidar."
"Therefore, I am not asking that we do not vote, but that we should hold a debate as usual."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, clearly the House is divided."
"This is a very delicate issue."
"There is a lot of confusion."
"Can I please request that we delay this vote until 15.00 so that we can consult both the parties and the groups, and also discover what is actually happening on the ground in Morocco?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard all the comments."
"You have heard everything and you have a full picture."
"In accordance with Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure, I am putting this motion to a vote."
"We have a specific motion, that we do not discuss this matter today."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"(DE) Mr President, I very much regret having to ask once again for the patience of the House."
"On the voting list today, we have the vote on the principle of subsidiarity."
"Under the terms of Rule 177(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I request that we postpone a vote on this point until the next plenary session and investigate the legitimacy of passing a resolution on this point."
"I believe that there is substantial agreement throughout this House that the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights should be guaranteed."
"However, there is absolutely no point in raising this to the level of the European Union."
"I would also like to say specifically on behalf of my Italian fellow Members that the debate taking place in Italy is an Italian and not a European debate and that, like us, my fellow Members will defend diversity and plurality."
"However, it does not make sense to do this in a resolution of this kind."
"(Heckling)"
"Mr President, it is amazing that groups which have the concept of democracy in their name are not even familiar with the democratic principle of allowing a speaker to finish what he is saying."
"Under the terms of Rule 177(4), I request that the vote is postponed until the next session and that the legitimacy of the resolution and the vote is investigated."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz, please put on your headphones."
"I have a specific proposal - we will reach this point in the second part of the vote."
"First we will vote on the budget, and then we have several additional points."
"You can all think about Mr Schulz's proposal and we will come back to it in a moment, when we all have the resolution in front of us, in the second part of the vote."
"(DE) Mr President, now that the urgent matter has been removed from the agenda, I would like to ask you to divide the speaking time for the Western Sahara item between the other two urgent matters, as we had some tough discussions yesterday about the speaking time for urgent matters."
"This is my practical proposal for this afternoon and I would ask you to accept it, as we will be spending an hour discussing urgent matters."
"We will take your suggestion into account."
"1."
"Mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument ("

"Draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (vote)"
"Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, we are about to hold probably the shortest vote on the budget under the Nice Treaty, and it is sure that this will be the last vote under the Nice Treaty."
"How is it possible that the voting list is so short?"
"It is due to the excellent cooperation of the groups."
"As a rapporteur, I should like to thank all the groups who participated in the preparation of this vote."
"In addition to that, I should like to thank the Secretariat for its work."
"Without them, it would also have been impossible to have been here with just these two pages."
"Thank you very much to all of you."
"(Applause)"
"And I think that this shortness is justified, for, in a time of crisis, we should work to manage the crisis and not spend time on lengthy votes."
"Mr President, I propose that we vote on the Other Institutions block in a single vote as I am not expecting any problems."
"A situation has arisen in which we are voting on different institutions, and in accordance with the rules, we are obliged to vote on each institution separately."
"It is not possible to combine it all into one block."
"That would be contrary to procedure."
"Mr President, the Council notes with satisfaction that Parliament has confirmed the agreement that we reached at the conciliation meeting on 18 November this year."
"In conjunction with the outcome of the second reading in the Council, we are happy that Parliament's second reading can be deemed to represent a common text from the two parts of the budgetary authority in accordance with the new Article 314 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Council accepts this common text and the President of the European Parliament can thus declare the budget finally approved."
"However, I would like to point out that once you, Mr President, have declared the budget finally approved, the Council believes that it should be signed by both parties since the new Treaty states that both the Council and Parliament are responsible for it."
"The Council regrets the fact that this position has not been taken into account."
"Having said that, we are not questioning in any way whatsoever what has been agreed."
"Nonetheless, we hope that next year's budgetary procedure will allow sufficient time to deal with these matters."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, and the three rapporteurs, Mr Surján, Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug, for their constructive attitude throughout the budgetary procedure, which also demonstrates the very good cooperation that we have enjoyed in this work."
"I would like to finish with a personal reflection."
"Being President-in-Office of the Council is probably the most distinguished office that I will ever hold."
"It has been a great honour for me to serve Europe in this way and I would like to express my thanks for this opportunity."
"Thank you very much indeed."
"(Applause)"
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"

"Draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (all sections) ("
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is proposed that Amendments 3 and 7, which are identical in the text, be voted in three parts, and that an oral amendment be made to the second part."
"Why?"
"Because the original text mentioned the opinion of the Commission but, in the meantime, the Council has decided on this issue."
"Therefore, I will read out the new proposal: 'notes the European Council conclusions that the EU and its Member States are ready to contribute with fast-start funding of EUR 2.4 billion annually for the years 2010 to 2012; stresses, however, the need for information on participation and contribution from the EU budget during 2011 and 2012'."
"That is the oral amendment, and my proposal is to vote in favour of all three parts."
"(The oral amendment was adopted)"
"I would like to take the opportunity to extend my best wishes to you all for the three-week break."
"We have some very important work before us next year."
"I would like to invite you all to cocktails on 12 January 2010, to mark the new year and the beginning of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is so important for us."
"So I invite everyone on 12 January."
"Madam President, there is a mistake in the EPP voting list."
"I wish to point out to EPP colleagues that the vote on the two separate votes should be a 'plus' in our voting list - so, a 'plus' for the two separate votes that we shall be voting upon now."
"Mr President, this is a private matter for the EPP, and I do not see why the Assembly should be bored with it."

"(DE) Madam President, I would like to repeat my point of order:"
"(Uproar in the Chamber)"
"I am pleased that I am always able to wake my fellow Members up."
"This is good for the circulation."
"Once again, under the terms of Rule 177(4), I request that the vote is postponed and that the legitimacy of the resolution and the vote is investigated in the meantime."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to look at the procedural argument."
"I would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the Cashman report."
"This is a report created by Parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure."
"Our Legal Service has stated that this is not permitted, but the socialists insisted on introducing it."
"While we were discussing the freedom of the press in Italy and the Commissioner responsible explained that the European Union has no authority in this area, the socialists still felt that it was worthwhile to attack Berlusconi."
"Whenever it suits the socialists, it is a question of there being no authority. Whenever other people are being opposed, the authority is in place."
"For this reason, we should not give in to them."
"However, the second argument is worthy of serious discussion."
"Are we responsible for the Convention on Human Rights?"
"I would like to remind my fellow Members that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will become party to the Convention on Human Rights."
"This means that if it is legitimate for the Italian Parliament to discuss this, because Italy is party to the Convention on Human Rights, then it is also legitimate for the European Parliament to discuss this, as it will be party to the Convention on Human Rights in future."
"My third and final argument concerns the fact that we are not lawyers, we are politicians."
"This judgment affects millions of people and, therefore, we should vote on it today."
"(Applause)"

"Belarus (vote)"
"Madam President, the rationale of this amendment is to raise awareness of recent cases of repression in Belarus."
"My oral amendment is just to add one more name - that of a young democratic activist who was kidnapped on 6 December this year - to the list of names listed in this amendment."
"So it will read as follows: after mentioning Zmitser Dashkevich, I would like to add 'and Yauhen Afnahel on 6 December 2009'."
"This is just adding one more person to the list of those who are being harassed by the Belarusian Government."

"(ET) Mr President, the decision taken on the implementation of the flexibility instrument shows the success of international cooperation and, once again, gives an assurance that the institutions of Europe consider it urgent to fund the second stage of the recovery plan for the European economy."
"Another positive thing in this resolution was the fact that we were able to find unspent funds in the economy recovery plan for energy projects, confirming this later in the budget."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"(ET) I also supported this report, the adoption of the report, because the result from the Conciliation Committee - apparently the Conciliation Committee does not proceed very straightforwardly and quickly - was positive: to implement the recovery plan for the European economy, to implement the stated aim of this plan."
"Another positive thing was that we supported the previous decision in the later vote on the budget to set aside EUR 2.4 billion for the purposes mentioned."
"I supported this report."
"Madam President, Nick Griffin of the British National Party has suggested that my voting is influenced by commercial interests."
"I want to make it clear that I am proud to be an advocate of low-carbon technologies to fight climate change."
"I have never requested or been paid a penny for my work;"
"I do it because I believe in it."
"Any shareholdings I have ever had have always been declared in the declaration of interests, and they have never stopped me from criticising some wind-power projects."
"Openness and transparency have always been the hallmarks of my political life, and, before Nick Griffin tries to smear the reputation of Members here, let him explain why the party he leads has failed twice to submit its accounts on time to Britain's Electoral Commission."
"His accountants say that the accounts do not give a true and fair view of his party's affairs."
"Many people suspect that money from his party's members have been used for personal gain."
"If he denies it, then perhaps Mr Griffin could produce a set of accounts that his own auditors will approve."
"Madam President, if I may misquote John Dunning, an English MP in the 18th century, the EU budget has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished."
"I voted against the budget resolution because it breaches the 1% limit on gross domestic product."
"That is a limit we should not breach."
"We need to be aware that every euro we spend comes from the taxpayer."
"We should be prudent with their money, and this is not a prudent budget."
"Madam President, I, like my previous colleague, also voted against the budget."
"It is interesting how we often talk about European common values and solidarity with the citizens."
"Yet, at a time when many communities and families are struggling with the current economic situation, struggling to pay the bills, some of them losing their jobs, many even taking pay cuts, I think it is outrageous that we are voting to increase a budget which takes no account of the current economic situation."
"We need sound finances, we need to show that we understand the concerns of our electorate and we need to be prudent with taxpayers' money."
"Only in that way can we generate the growth which is so badly needed to help citizens right across countries of the European Union."
"That is why I voted against this budget."
"I would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the resolution because the Belarusians here today demonstrate the level of their engagement with the European Union."
"Despite a lot of talking on the Belarusian side, only modest changes have so far taken place."
"Most recently, we have heard from the opposition that the President intends to sign a decree limiting access to free information on the Internet."
"The EU certainly needs to support Belarus to draw it closer to Europe, but first of all, we need to engage with the Belarusian people."
"It seems that now we are trying to engage with the Belarusian authorities by suspending the travel bans, but the travel bans are still there for the ordinary people of Belarus."
"EUR 60 for the Schengen visa is too expensive for the majority of Belarusians."
"At the same time, the price for Russian citizens is half as much."
"The EU would not suffer if the citizens of Belarus covered only the cost of the visa, which is not more than EUR 5."
"I would be grateful if Mr Brok and Mr Saryusz-Wolski would go and have their discussions somewhere else."
"Mr Brok, could you have your discussion outside of the Chamber, please?"
"Could you please have your discussion outside of the Chamber?"
"Out!"
"Mr Brok, will you please leave the Chamber and have your discussion outside."
"Mr Preda, if you wish to make an explanation of vote on Belarus, I will take it now."
"Is that what you wish?"
"(RO) I was wanting to provide an explanation of why I voted for the proposal made by Mr Schulz."
"As I did not think there would be such a proposal, I did not register beforehand, but I would like to explain my vote for Mr Schulz's first proposal relating..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I am sorry, it is not possible."
"I thought you wanted to speak on Belarus."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution because the situation in Congo is horrific."
"Tens of thousands of people are killed in the country every month because of violence from the armed groups."
"The Congolese armed forces are often at the centre of such crimes, using unrestrained force at times, and civilians are usually the victims of such violence."
"The situation of women is appalling, with sexual violence a specific problem in the country."
"There are reported rapes by almost all fighting parties, including the Congolese army."
"We welcome the EU's engagement in Congo."
"European military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in Rwanda."
"The EU police mission is especially important, since the main problem Congo faces is impunity and lack of criminal-prosecution capacity."
"However, in order to achieve significant progress, we need more engagement from the international community."
"That is why more action needs to be conducted through the MONUC and more resources have to be given to the United Nations."
"Madam President, as we leave for our Christmas vacations and our fat turkeys and whatever we eat in the festive season, we must also go with the thought that, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many people will die during the same period."
"Nearly five million people have been killed there since 1999, and it is estimated that 45 000 - the size of a small English town - 45 000 people get killed there every month."
"As we celebrate Christmas, we ought to think about this and wonder whether these people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and ourselves are still living on the same planet."
"For twenty odd years or more, the United Nations has been trying valiantly to bring this situation to some stability, but only with 20 000 soldiers."
"How on earth can they manage to keep the peace with 20 000 soldiers?"
"We need to help the UN do an effective job and arrest those people who are behaving with impunity and who are raping and killing women and children."
"We need seriously to end this now."
"Madam President, on behalf of the EPP Group, I wish to state that the EPP voted against the resolution, not because it does not favour transparency or access to documents, certainly under the new treaty, but because it had tabled its own resolution - which eventually we did not vote on - which presented, to our mind, a more balanced approach to this very delicate issue."
"We have to be careful when discussing the issue of access to documentation and transparency that we do not go overboard, and that we do not expose documentation and procedures to a degree which makes the entire system unfeasible."
"If we are to open up secret negotiations and closed negotiations completely, then we might end up undermining the very negotiations and the very system on which we are built."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this very reluctantly."
"Whilst it mainly concerned the reallocation of existing funds, it would involve subsidy, by use of the Flexibility Instrument."
"However, the main purpose was to reimburse Bulgaria and other countries that had been forced to decommission functioning nuclear reactors, against their better judgment."
"A promise of funding had been made by the EU and that promise had to be kept."
"in writing. - Following the conciliation meeting held on 18 November 2009, Parliament and the Council were capable of coming to an agreement regarding the use of the Flexibility Instrument in favour of the EERP as well as of the decommissioning of the Kozloduy power plant in Bulgaria."
"While both are important, I feel that the proper and correct decommissioning of this power plant is particularly important."
"I have thereby decided to support the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report."
"The motion for a resolution that is being debated concerns European financing for the period 2010-2013 for the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria and the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument for this purpose, thus honouring a commitment made to Bulgaria during its accession process."
"It also concerns additional financing under the Flexibility Instrument for the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) in the area of energy, since this plan had not yet been adequately financed."
"I do not deny that nuclear energy can form part of a well-balanced European energy basket and that its use may lessen our external dependence in this field, but I believe the European Union cannot avoid sharing in the effort to close down that obsolete nuclear facility while also ensuring that economic recovery projects deserve adequate funding."
"The environmental safety resulting from the decommissioning of Kozloduy and greater investment in energy projects are both good reasons to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument."
"At the conciliation meeting of 18 November 2009, the Flexibility Instrument was mobilised to finance the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear plant to the sum of EUR 75 million in 2010."
"I deplore the fact that the Commission only presented these financing needs in Amending Letter No 2/2010 after Parliament's first reading, in other words, after Parliament had set its priorities."
"That created additional pressure on subheading 1a, considerably affecting the dynamics of the negotiations on the 2010 budget and jeopardising Parliament's political priorities."
"Nonetheless, promises once made have to be kept, as in the case of the protocol concerning the conditions for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, which contains the EU's commitment to finance the decommissioning of Kozloduy."
"The additional financing needs in 2011-2013, totalling EUR 225 million, must be addressed in a mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework."
"Further financing of Kozloduy in 2011-2013 should be without prejudice to the financing of existing multiannual programmes and actions."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"The use of this fund is based on the logic behind the energy strand of the European economic recovery plan."
"I shall abstain for the same reasons."
"in writing. - The recovery plan has been one of the Commission's responses to the economic crisis that has plagued Europe in recent years."
"Its goals include restoring business as well as consumer confidence and, in particular, ensuring that lending is carried out."
"There has been a need to be flexible and allow for funds to be reallocated from different budgets when necessary."
"This is why I have to support the rapporteur's views and vote in favour of the proposal."
"The European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), to which the sum of EUR 5 billion was allocated by Parliament in March 2009, is divided into trans-European energy projects and projects to develop broadband Internet in rural areas."
"This is an important instrument for tackling the economic crisis, reviving the economy and hence creating jobs."
"During the conciliation meeting of 18 November, an agreement was reached by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on financing for the second year (2010) of the EERP, to the sum of EUR 2.4 billion."
"This financing, for energy and broadband Internet projects, requires a review of the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013."
"Financing of the EERP should not be postponed to subsequent years, and I therefore welcome the agreement that was reached."
"I would also point out that the current multiannual financial framework does not meet the European Union's financial needs."
"Consequently, the Commission should urgently submit a proposal for a mid-term review of the MFF."
"I also endorse the need to extend the 2007-2013 MFF to the years 2015-2016."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Even if some positive use is made of the funds being mobilised here, they are still far from enough to address rural areas' need for support."
"Agriculture in the countries of the European Union has many other needs and the farmers who work the land are calling for an agricultural policy that encourages production, guarantees them a decent living and prevents the ongoing desertification of rural areas."
"It is not enough, therefore, merely to say that we are promoting solidarity in the energy resources field and promoting broadband in rural areas if we really want to contribute to the recovery of Europe's economy."
"As we have advocated, what is needed is a thorough revision of Community policies and a substantial increase in budget funding."
"That is why we abstained."
"The energy strand of the European Economic Recovery Plan contains some striking proposals. These include the creation of a specific 2020 fund, the increase in state requirements concerning the environmental performance of goods, and the incentive to construct energy-efficient buildings."
"The decommissioning of the first-generation Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, for its part, fulfils an urgent requirement."
"Just as remarkable, however, is the fact that the EU plans to provide no assistance whatsoever to a project to move us away from nuclear power."
"Clearly, although it is a matter of urgency, the EU is not firmly committed to making the break from maximum productivity."
"How could it, when it is committed to giving absolute priority to the principles of liberalism glorified by this recovery plan?"
"That is why, on this chapter, I decided to abstain."
"I supported the European Union budget for the financial year 2010."
"I particularly welcome the agreement with the Council, which will provide extra aid to the value of EUR 300 million to dairy farmers."
"One of the demands the Parliament made at the talks about budget 2010 was that a dairy fund worth EUR 300 million would be provided to deal with the dairy crisis."
"Although the Commission agreed with the proposal initially, it wanted to put only EUR 280 million into that fund."
"This money will be a great help to dairy farmers who were severely affected by the low prices over the summer and who are having problems with liquidity."
"I also welcome the support provided in the budget for the Special Olympic Games organisation and for their request regarding funding for the European Special Olympic Games in Warsaw in 2010 and for the World Special Olympic Games in Athens in 2011."
"EUR 6 million has been allocated to the Special Olympic Games, with a provision for further funding to be provided in 2011."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted, unenthusiastically, for the European budget for the financial year 2010 so as not to jeopardise the funding of the second section of the European recovery plan (energy infrastructure and broadband Internet), the launch of a new European initiative to promote micro-credit (amounting to EUR 25 million in 2010), or emergency aid for the milk sector (an additional EUR 300 million)."
"I would point out that my French socialist colleagues and I voted against the financial perspective for 2007-2013 as far back as 2006."
"Back then, we criticised a cut-price budget which, because of its shortcomings, would not have enabled far-reaching innovative projects to be developed."
"Today, our analysis is being confirmed: this budget does not put us in a position to tackle the crisis, and it reflects the absence of a European political project."
"Although the unprecedented economic crisis that Europe is going through requires a strong, common response from the Union, the Council and the European Commission have chosen to allow the Member States to develop their own recovery plans."
"It is not with a budget such as this that we will restore lasting growth and successfully combat climate change."
"The outcome of the vote on the 2010 budget marks an important step in the drafting and application of joint norms and measures required to regulate the areas of energy, technology, agriculture and infrastructure."
"It is seen as providing proper support in a context where Member States' economies are facing a crisis situation."
"I welcome the allocation of EUR 300 million, although only EUR 280 million had been allocated initially, as immediate aid intended for dairy producers who are facing a collapse in prices, leading to insecurity."
"I believe that this action will tackle the causes but, above all, the effects which have led to this considerable slump in the dairy product market, which is happening against the backdrop of the current economic crisis."
"The 2010 EU budget has just been adopted."
"With this budget of EUR 2.4 billion, we will be able to finance the second and final phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan, and that is good news."
"Unfortunately, the negotiations on the financing of a European programme to promote micro-credit - a particularly useful and necessary instrument for reviving growth - are being held up at the Council."
"Similarly, the Council's rejection of Parliament's amendment proposing to increase the aid granted to people most in need, at a time of unprecedented economic and social crisis, is highly regrettable, when 2010 has been declared the 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion'."
"On the other hand, the European Council's announcement, last Friday, of the willingness of the EU and its Member States to contribute to the financing and prompt implementation of EUR 2.4 billion per year from 2010 to 2012 to help developing countries combat climate change is along the right lines."
"However, if the Council wants to be consistent and responsible, it must accept the urgent need for a mid-term review of the 2007-2013 financial framework."
"Without it, this news would unfortunately be nothing other than a publicity stunt."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have decided to vote today in favour of the second tranche of financing for the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"The plan is an important step in our joint efforts to enable the EU to recover from the financial and economic crisis."
"However, a large part of the recovery plan involves investments in CCS technologies."
"We are in favour of further research in this area, but we feel that we should not focus too much on this technology until CCS has been compared with other existing methods of reducing carbon emissions."
"Such a comparison would enable us to invest the EU's resources where they would be of most benefit in combating climate change."
"We support the budgetary commitment and voted in favour of all the parts with the exception of the requirement to introduce permanent support for the milk sector, which we voted against."
"As I said before, I think it essential that the specific conditions of the crisis that we are currently experiencing be taken into account when we discuss the allocation of funds to the various sectors of the European economy."
"In particular, I believe it is essential to allocate funds to implementing the European Economic Recovery Plan, particularly with regard to adopting measures to stimulate economic growth, competitiveness, cohesion and job protection."
"I reiterate that allocating the necessary funds so that small and medium-sized enterprises, which are among the main victims of the crisis, can receive support to help them weather this crisis is essential, and the Structural and Cohesion Funds are crucially important for national economic growth."
"I regret, however, that only EUR 300 million, which I regard as too little, has been allocated for the creation of a fund for the dairy farming sector."
"The serious crisis that the sector is currently experiencing would justify the allocation of more funds to help producers overcome the difficulties they are currently facing."
"This is a budget that will help to fight unemployment and kick-start the economy."
"Parliament is prioritising the European Economic Recovery Plan, with financing of EUR 2.4 billion for the coming year."
"I welcome the granting of EUR 300 million of additional support to the dairy sector, but I advocate creating a budget heading to establish a permanent fund for this sector."
"I also consider it very important that the current multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 be revised and extended to the 2015-2016 financial years, as we proposed in this budget."
"I would point out that the fight against climate change is an EU priority that is not sufficiently addressed in this budget."
"I would also point out that energy security is crucial for the Union, and I therefore welcome the signing of the Nabucco project."
"The budgets for Parliament and the other institutions, which have been tabled for second reading, are the same as we approved at first reading."
"Under heading 5, we have a margin of EUR 72 million, which will be used preferentially for financing additional expenditure directly attributable to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"We voted against this report, which 'welcomes the overall agreement on Budget 2010', because this is a Community budget that already reflects the priorities set in the Treaty of Lisbon for a European Union that is increasingly neoliberal and militaristic and less and less concerned with economic and social cohesion."
"In the midst of an economic and social crisis that is having terrible effects on employment and people's living conditions, it is unacceptable for the Community draft budget to have EUR 11 billion less in payments than was projected in the financial perspective."
"We welcome the fact, however, that some of the proposals we tabled were adopted, namely:"
"the creation of a budget heading for actions in the textile and footwear industry, with a view to creating a Community programme for the industry;"
"the creation of another heading to promote the transformation of jobs with no stability into jobs with rights."
"The aims of these proposals are firstly to draw attention to the severe crisis that the textile industry is currently undergoing, which was partly caused by the exponential rise in imports from third countries, and secondly to help fight the rapid growth in job instability, unemployment and poverty."
"Madam President, as a result of the conciliation procedure, a level of expenditure was agreed which was satisfactory for Parliament and sufficient for realisation of the most important objectives of the Union next year."
"Especially significant are the agreements concerning means for realisation of the European Economic Recovery Plan, including projects in the field of energy, for which EUR 1 980 million has been reserved."
"A sum of EUR 420 million will be allocated to increasing the availability of broadband Internet, which will contribute to realisation of the principles of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Significant last-minute changes were made to planned administrative expenditures in connection with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Establishment of the European Council as an EU institution, as well as establishment of the office of President of the European Council and the External Action Service, entail consequences for the Union budget."
"Costs related to the European Council and the President are estimated at EUR 23.5 million and will be met with savings from 2009, whereas costs associated with establishment of the External Action Service may exceed even the EUR 72 million which is currently in the budget reserve for 2010."
"So the debate on expenditure in 2010 will not end today."
"The funds in the reserve may turn out to be insufficient, and then it will be essential to make a correction to the budget."
"It is necessary, therefore, to appeal to the Member States to show responsibility and make available the means needed for the Union to meet the new obligations which result from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It was somewhat unenthusiastically that I voted in favour of the 2010 budget, since it is no match for the challenges that we have to face, not only in this context of serious economic and social crisis, but also in view of the fight against climate change."
"My main aim, with my vote, was to prioritise support for the European recovery plan, for the launch of a new initiative on micro-credit (EUR 25 million in 2010) and for emergency aid for the milk sector (EUR 300 million)."
"In future, it is the effectiveness of the EU budgetary framework that we will have to review in order to equip ourselves with collective resources for action that are genuinely in keeping with reforms."
"I am voting in favour of the report on the 2010 EU budget."
"I am particularly pleased that, although this is the last budget negotiated on the basis of the Treaty of Nice and although, on this basis, the European Parliament has no formal decision-making authority on agricultural spending, we have succeeded in negotiating a budgetary item of EUR 300 million to support dairy farmers."
"The 2010 EU budget respects the previous commitments assumed at European level with regard to the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"Although it has been a fairly difficult task for us to find the necessary resources both for tackling the problems triggered by the crisis and for continuing the development projects which the European Union already has, I think that the budget extensively covers both situations."
"For example, the commitments made by the President of the European Commission at the end of 2008 were retained and innovative measures were also introduced, such as the Preparatory Action - Erasmus for young entrepreneurs."
"This budget will enable Romania to continue to enjoy financial support provided from the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"In addition, good prospects are being created for dealing with the matter of the borders in the eastern part of the European Union, as well as for the Black Sea Basin area, given that resources have been allocated for preparatory action aimed at environmental monitoring of the Black Sea Basin and for a common European framework programme for developing this region."
"Furthermore, we have considered, although we are going through a difficult period, focusing attention on tourism as a source of development, as highlighted by the budget allocation for sustainable and social tourism."
"The European Union's budget is a reflection of its policies: it is neoliberal and oblivious to the interest of the majority."
"The crisis in the capitalist system and the environmental crisis - the consequence of the fanatical obsession with maximum productivity entailed by the endless pursuit of profit - will not have had any effect on it."
"The EU continues indiscriminately to apply neoliberal dogmas without giving due regard to the evidence of their economic ineffectiveness and environmental and social harmfulness."
"Only yesterday, Parliament was voting for aid to be granted under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"This fund is purely and simply about putting a socialist slant on the senseless relocations of large groups such as Ford, Nokia and Dell."
"And that is just one example."
"What can we say about the European Economic Recovery Plan, which advocates free trade, flexible working and maximum productivity?"
"No, that Europe is definitely not the solution but the problem."
"Voting for this budget would go against the European general interest."
"in writing. - (PT) The report adopted today is extremely important in several respects, first of all, because it provides for an economic recovery plan worth EUR 2.5 billion."
"The sum of EUR 300 million has also been approved for the textile sector, something that Parliament had been demanding for a long time."
"The budget also includes several lines of support aimed at evaluating the status of key sectors of the economy, such as the textile and footwear industry and the fisheries sector, to promote renewal of the fishing fleet, which are very important sectors for my country."
"The pilot projects to halt desertification and to preserve jobs are also extremely relevant in these times of economic crisis."
"It should also be noted that this was the last EU budget under the Treaty of Nice."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers are extended to the whole budget."
"in writing. - (ES) This budget will not help to resolve the economic, social and environmental problems facing the European Union which have been aggravated by the crisis."
"It also fails to take account of increased social and regional inequalities, unemployment and poverty."
"The European Union's budget must serve to effectively prioritise convergence policies based on social progress, the preservation and promotion of each Member State's potential, the sustainable use of natural resources and environmental protection, in order to achieve genuine economic and social cohesion."
"My entire group is united in rejecting the idea of using the Community's budget to promote a more militarist and neoliberal European Union."
"That is why we are opposed to the increase in military expenditure contained in the budget."
"In this connection, we wish to highlight the need for democratic control of expenditure relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"This is a grey area outside the scope of the control to which budgetary expenditure is subject."
"During an economic crisis, when the citizens of Europe are being subjected to waves of redundancies and cuts in social services, the European Union must also make savings."
"In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Plan can achieve this."
"In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers."
"In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds."
"This means that hard-earned taxpayers' money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels."
"Instead of continuing to inflate the EU budget, far-reaching renationalisation of the subsidy system is needed."
"For this reason, I reject the draft budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the excellent work done by the rapporteur, who has succeeded in securing funding for the European Economic Recovery Plan to the tune of EUR 1.98 billion, making it a fundamental objective of the 2010 budget."
"I am sure that the new plan will provide a renewed impetus for economic growth, competitiveness, cohesion and job protection in Europe, at the same time showing that the EU budget is a tool aimed at putting European citizens first and which can provide specific responses so as to be instrumental in helping to overcome the recent economic crisis that has affected our continent."
"It is now up to the Commission to ensure that all projects to be financed under the recovery plan will be fully compatible with current EU environmental legislation."
"The joint declaration calling for the simplification and a more targeted use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to help overcome the effects of the economic crisis should also be welcomed."
"The allocation of EUR 300 million to overcome the crisis in the milk sector is also very effective."
"This represents an additional EUR 20 million compared with the Council recommendation, which we can only welcome."
"We believe that agricultural policy needs to be deregulated and market-based if it is to be of benefit to consumers and the rural population."
"Thorough reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore necessary."
"All forms of export and production subsidies for agriculture should be abolished as soon as possible, and by 2015 at the latest."
"Abolition of the EU and US farming subsidies is also vital if we are to combat global poverty and hunger."
"During the same period, all trade barriers in respect of agricultural produce and fish should be phased out, thereby allowing free trade in food."
"The part of the EU budget for 2010 that concerns agriculture falls under heading 2 - 'Conservation and management of natural resources' - and makes up what is known as Block 3."
"This block contains intervention and support measures that we oppose, including various stockpiling measures - such as for alcohol - and extensive EU support for the wine sector."
"It also includes EU support for milk and fruit in schools."
"This in itself is important, but we believe this matter should instead be dealt with at national level."
"At the same time, the block contains important initiatives in respect of animal welfare and controls on animal transports, for example, which we would, in principle, welcome."
"However, since the voting procedure forces us to take a position on this group of amendments as a whole, we have chosen to abstain from voting on Block 3."
"Since Parliament acknowledges European citizens' wish for a safe and secure Europe, it welcomes the increases in sub-heading 3a on freedom, security and justice relative to the 2009 budget."
"It stresses the importance of further funding being made available via the EU budget to manage legal immigration and integration of third-country nationals while in parallel tackling illegal immigration."
"It points out that these policies must always be implemented against the backcloth of respect for the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Equally important is the increase in funding for border protection, including the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund, to facilitate solidarity between the Member States."
"It acknowledges that all countries in the Union are facing growing challenges in relation to policies covered by this heading, and urges the Member States to make use of the increase in funding for freedom, security and justice relative to the 2009 budget so that they can together face these and any new challenges that may arise by promoting a common immigration policy that is as inclusive as possible but grounded in absolute respect for human rights."
"in writing. - I welcome the outcome of this vote on the 2010 budget."
"It will ensure funds are directed to various important projects and will provide much needed support, especially in the light of the economic difficulties still facing the European Union."
"Of particular importance is the EUR 300 million which will be allocated to the dairy sector following the recent crisis."
"The Council finally agreed to the European Parliament's request for this amount, having previously argued for EUR 280 million."
"There is also significant funding being allocated to the second stage of the Economic Recovery Plan - EUR 2.4 billion - which includes vital support for energy (including renewable energy) projects and infrastructure, as well as EUR 420 million to provide broadband access in rural areas."
"The budget will therefore allow significant developments in the areas of energy, infrastructure, and technology, as well as providing crucial assistance in the current economic climate."
"The vote on the European Union budget is an annual institutional landmark whereby the commitment to Community programmes is confirmed and Parliament's role is emphasised."
"I welcome the conclusion of the second phase of funding for the European Economic Recovery Plan for 2009 and 2010, since economic and employment recovery are major concerns for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in the current crisis."
"Confirmation of the new microfinance facility programme demonstrates the priority being given to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and the important role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in job creation."
"I must express my concern regarding the cuts in budget appropriations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which are vital for economic revival and territorial cohesion, especially in the outermost regions like Madeira."
"I think it is essential to continue to make the cohesion policy more flexible with a view to raising the currently low levels of implementation of programmes financed from Community funds."
"In addition, projects that have strategic aims, provide added value and encourage competitiveness in the long term should continue to be promoted."
"For all these reasons, I voted in favour of this report, which is the culmination of a technically intricate process that was difficult to negotiate."
"I voted in favour of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (all sections) and for the Letters of Amendment to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010."
"The 2010 EU budget provides considerable sums for the commitments made through the European Economic Recovery Plan, such as power networks (EUR 1 175 million), the European offshore wind power network (EUR 208 million) and capture and geological storage of carbon (EUR 523.2 million)."
"The European Parliament has also managed to top up the sums allocated for transport safety, the SESAR Joint Undertaking, activities for supporting European policies in the areas of transport and passenger rights, the Intelligent Energy Europe programme, which is part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking."
"Furthermore, the sums allocated for agriculture include an increase of EUR 14 billion for promoting rural development and EUR 300 million for supporting dairy producers who have been hit very hard by the economic and financial crisis."
"Due to the economic and financial crisis, the main concern European citizens have nowadays is about losing their job."
"I believe that in 2010, particular attention should be focused on programmes for training young entrepreneurs and for supporting them in setting up their own companies."
"Today, we have adopted a European Union budget for 2010 amounting to almost EUR 123 billion."
"Every budget is a kind of compromise."
"Perhaps many of us are conscious of its deficiencies, but it is worth stressing that the average citizen of the EU gains by the document adopted today."
"Above all, the European Union is strengthening its energy security and is banking on the development of businesses, and particularly of micro-enterprises."
"I am pleased that EUR 20 million has been reserved for the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"It is true that the reserve funds will be released only when the European Commission presents written proposals for their use. I do believe, however, that this will happen as quickly as possible."
"I am particularly pleased by the inclusion in the budget of three projects which are important to my country."
"I am thinking of the support for the Special Olympics, which will be held in Warsaw and Athens, grants for young people from countries included in the programme of the European Neighbourhood Policy and establishment of the Bronisław Geremek Chair of European Civilisation at the College of Europe in Natolin."
"The openness of European institutions and the transparency of their procedures are guarantees that civil society and public opinion in the Member States are not only kept informed but are also an integral and informed part of their decision-making processes."
"Although people feel somewhat divorced from Europe, not least because the procedure that led to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon was troubled, not always clear and often open to criticism, the European institutions must persist in and commit themselves wholeheartedly to making the greatest possible number of documents available in good time, thus helping to close the gap."
"I must, however, deplore the fact that the left in Parliament has used the necessary improvement in the legal framework regulating document access, in the wake of the entry into force of the treaty, to take the populist stance of dismissing the real need for confidentiality in some areas of European action and seeking to elevate itself as the sole champion of transparency."
"Affairs of such sensitivity can do without artificial and populist splits; they deserve to be taken seriously, with a sense of responsibility and the broadest possible consensus."
"I regret that that has not been possible."
"I gave my full support to the resolution tabled by my colleague, Mr Cashman, in order to call on the Commission and the Council to review the rules on access to European institutional documents, in accordance with the clauses on transparency laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This issue is crucial to ensuring the democratic and responsible functioning of our institutions and must help to restore European citizens' confidence in Europe."
"In the vote on Thursday, 17 December 2009, I voted against resolution from Mr Cashman on the improvements needed to the legal framework for access to documents following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001) for the following reasons: this resolution refers to facts which have nothing to do with the subject of transparency and calls for changes, the consequences of which would not make a constructive contribution to improving transparency."
"I would like to emphasise that I am very much in favour of transparency and public access to documents."
"However, these important objectives will not be achieved by fulfilling Mr Cashman's demands, but only by dealing with the subject responsibly as highlighted in the resolution of Renate Sommer, Simon Busuttil and Manfred Weber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on this subject."
"It is vitally important to make European action more transparent and to permit the broadest possible access to European institutional documents in order to give European citizens a greater understanding of how the Union works."
"However, we must be vigilant on this point and guard against any kind of demagogy."
"For the sake of the effectiveness of European action, restrictions must be placed on this sacrosanct principle of transparency."
"The risk, in permitting maximum transparency, is that we will have sterile debates insofar as MEPs will be afraid to speak openly on sensitive issues."
"Negotiations, by definition, demand a discrete environment."
"Without it, these debates will take place in informal settings far removed from official meetings, and the end result will be the opposite of what we were trying to achieve. Therefore, yes to greater transparency, and, in this connection, I welcome the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It will enable these changes to take place, but this must not be at the expense of sound European decision making."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon makes it necessary to introduce improvements in the legal framework regulating document access."
"Such improvements must safeguard the rights of all citizens of the Union."
"Since the Union is an area of freedom, security and justice, as laid down in the Preamble to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, any effort that leads to greater transparency in access to EU institution documents is welcome."
"It is also highly important, however, to evaluate to what extent total freedom of access to all documents may be prejudicial to the proper functioning of the institutions."
"It is therefore essential to find a balance on this subject."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted resolutely in favour of the ambitious European Parliament resolution on access to documents for the citizens."
"I did so because it is always important to remind people that transparency is key to democracy, because the path to gaining access to European Union information is still too often full of pitfalls for the average citizen, and also because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, on 1 December, significantly alters the situation."
"The right of citizens to access European institutional documents, in any form, is now enshrined in Article 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Citizens are, moreover, seeing their rights extended to the legal opinions of the Council with, in return, obligations extended to all the European institutions."
"This vote also crowns all the work carried out by my political group, which has always been in the vanguard of this fight."
"On this subject, nine months ago, Parliament was adopting the Cappato report and calling for the Council's activities to be more transparent, open and democratic."
"Indeed, that institution has a moral obligation to make its decisions and its debates public; this is quite simply a democratic requirement that it is duty-bound to fulfil for the citizens."
"Transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation."
"Therefore, I support the efforts to introduce more transparency at an EU level."
"However, we need to maintain a balance."
"The resolution presented to us goes far beyond the transparency required by citizens and, therefore, I have voted against it."
"This motion for a resolution fails to find a balance between the necessary transparency and reasonable activity by the administration and the Members of Parliament at an EU level."
"In the current version, it is no longer possible to ensure the confidentiality of the written word, citizens' privacy can no longer be guaranteed when questions are asked, data protection is called into question and the consequences for our security and for the financial market policy of the European Central Bank cannot be predicted."
"In addition, it would give rise to a level of bureaucracy for the administration and the Members of Parliament that is totally out of proportion to its objective."
"in writing. - The Maltese delegation in the S&D Group will be voting in favour of the motion for resolution on the subsidiarity principle as presented by Mr Mauro, Mr Busuttil and Mr Weber."
"However, the delegation feels that a wider consensus and a bigger majority on the motion would send a stronger message to Europe."
"In this respect, therefore, it would be more beneficial to support the postponement motion - within a specific timeframe, since this could offer greater possibility for a broader consensus to be reached."
"It is the duty of all European institutions - national and Community institutions alike - to represent European citizens in their entirety, without distinction."
"Secularism is the only principle by which the institutions can allow citizens as a whole to access public services according to their beliefs."
"It is our common philosophical heritage and safeguards the principle of civil peace around which the EU was built."
"That is why it is absolutely crucial that Italy complies with the Lautsi v. Italy judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights."
"As the Court points out, the display of religious symbols must be prohibited in all public buildings within the EU."
"It is high time that crucifixes, which were imposed in classrooms under Mussolini, were withdrawn from the state school environment."
"in writing. - The Maltese delegation in the S&D Group will be voting in favour of the motion for resolution on the subsidiarity principle as presented by Mr Mauro, Mr Busuttil and Mr Weber."
"However, the delegation feels that a wider consensus and a bigger majority on the motion would send a stronger message to Europe."
"In this respect, therefore, it would be more beneficial to support the postponement motion - within a specific timeframe, since this could offer greater possibility for a broader consensus to be reached."
"Belarus has deservedly been given the unflattering sobriquet of the last Soviet republic in Europe."
"Despite the progress that has been made in some aspects of that country's political, social and economic life, it is clear that none of the reforms implemented there can yet justify rejecting that deplorable description."
"In Belarus, elections are not free, there is no freedom of expression, association or demonstration, and repression by the authorities is increasing."
"The European Union is in danger of being inclined to follow a line of appeasement with this dictatorship, as it did with Cuba."
"I think it will be wrong if it does so and does not make it clear that the values of democracy and freedom are not only non-negotiable but also inseparable from any agreements to be made with Belarus."
"The European Union must therefore maintain and strengthen its contacts with the democratic opposition in Belarus to keep faith with those to whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for their fight to democratise that country."
"The European Union cannot be an area concerned solely with the affairs of the countries that it comprises."
"It must also be a driving force for the democratisation of the countries that have emerged since the dismembering of the former Soviet Union."
"Any measures aimed at improving conditions in these countries are very important."
"That is the context for the spirit of this motion for a resolution, which calls for measures to be adopted to support Belarus, which must be accompanied by clear signs of democratic reforms by that country, as well as respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"The participation of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership is an important step in that direction, yet there are still many aspects to improve with regard to freedoms and safeguards within Belarus."
"I have voted in favour of the joint resolution on Belarus, because it gives a balanced presentation of the situation and highlights both the positive aspects and progress made and the democratic deficit in many areas."
"From my perspective, it is particularly important to ensure that the government of Belarus guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of association and assembly as quickly as possible, which would allow opposition parties to function effectively."
"The resolution on Belarus is an important signal from the European Union and from Europe."
"We should show both the democratic opposition and the Belarusian authorities, and not only by such resolutions, that we do not agree with the violations of human rights or the ban on registration of political parties, non-governmental organisations and independent media."
"The European Parliament cannot agree with the use of capital punishment, and Belarus is the only country in Europe which applies this kind of penalty."
"We cannot ease sanctions against Belarus if there is no noticeable progress in the direction of democratisation of the country."
"The European Union must not close its eyes to the flagrant restrictions on freedom of speech, respect for human and civil rights and non-governmental organisations."
"The European Parliament, which is composed of Members from 27 Member States, is an expression of democracy and cooperation."
"The only measures which we can and will support are democratic measures, because they are the foundation of the European Union."
"There can be no consent, on our part, to other measures."
"I hope the resolution on Belarus is one of many steps we will take."
"Belarusians, and also the whole of Europe, expect this of us."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for the resolution on Belarus with some doubt, because in the European Parliament, documents on Belarus are adopted too often and are thus devalued."
"On the other hand, while maintaining a critical tone towards the Minsk regime, this resolution accentuates more clearly than previous ones certain positive changes in EU-Belarus relations."
"In order for there to be a fundamental improvement in relations between the European Union, its Member States and Belarus, Belarus must steer towards reforms and democratisation."
"Such a turn would ease the development of all sorts of ties with this state."
"In Lithuania, 39 towns and regions are cooperating productively with Belarusian towns and regions, exchanging experience and participating in joint projects."
"I also approved of this resolution because it calls on the EU to devote more attention to concrete projects that coincide with the interests of the partner countries."
"In the resolution, we congratulated Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania, which became the first states to submit trilateral projects to the European Commission and EU Member States for the Eastern Partnership Programme."
"This is a list of concrete projects in the areas of border control, transport, transit, cultural and historical heritage and social and energy security."
"I welcome the vote on this resolution."
"Today, despite the Goma Conference on peace, stability and development and the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement in January 2008, violent fighting continues to take place in the east of the DRC, leading to the worst possible atrocities being committed against the civilian populations, in particular, women, children and the elderly."
"This sexual violence is becoming widespread and is today being perpetrated not only by the warring parties but also by civilians."
"Everything must urgently be done to ensure the protection of the populations at a time when the number of MONUC soldiers present on the ground means that it is not always possible to curb this increase in violence."
"The Congolese authorities have recently shown their determination to put a stop to impunity."
"However, this zero tolerance policy must not only be ambitious - every single perpetrator of the atrocities, without exception, will have to answer for his actions - but must also be applied in practice."
"We have a duty, as MEPs, to point out the need to respect these international obligations, such as human rights and gender equality, so that the dignity of women and the innocence of countless Congolese children are preserved."
"Ever since the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko's kleptocratic regime, the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Belgian Congo and formerly Zaire) has been mired in agitation and the most brutal violence, which has already led to millions of deaths."
"The east of the country has suffered particularly badly from this scourge, which knows no borders and has taken on much more of an ethnic than a national profile."
"The worst atrocities are repeated at such a rate that it is impossible to keep up with them, and the international community, particularly the UN forces, have not shown the ability to deal with them, despite all the civilian and military efforts that have been made so far."
"That some African countries appear to be ungovernable and central governments have lost control of parts of their territories are, unfortunately, phenomena that have yet to be eradicated."
"They are often connected with the illegal exploitation and plundering of raw materials either by insurgent forces or by regular troops and their leaders."
"Even if these phenomena have their origins in the European decolonisation process and the way the borders were drawn, that cannot release African leaders and decision makers from their responsibilities or from calling on civil society in those countries to take decisive control of their own destinies."
"I voted in favour of the resolution denouncing the serious ethnic violence that Congo has experienced recently and which has led to the displacement of almost 44 000 abandoned and totally destitute people."
"I am particularly concerned about the issue of sexual violence, which is being used as a weapon of war."
"This is an unacceptable crime, which must not go unpunished and which the European Union must take a stand against."
"We must ensure that those within the Congolese army who are responsible for these human rights violations are actually brought to justice."
"The European Union cannot remain aloof from the various armed conflicts that occur to some extent throughout the world."
"The violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a conflict that has been dragging on for many years, causing millions of people to die, to be displaced or to lose their homes."
"It is therefore very important to urge all parties in this conflict to cease hostilities so that the people of those regions can once again live in a climate of peace."
"It is vital that we continue to support the United Nations missions on the ground so as to ease the suffering of the whole population, especially the elderly, women and children."
"The armed conflict in the area can only be resolved by way of a political solution."
"All intervention by neighbouring and other countries must therefore cease."
"A diplomatic solution negotiated between the parties is required to bring the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to an end."
"Such a solution must comply fully with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The United Nations Security Council should review the mandate of MONUC."
"The mandate under Chapter VII should be done away with, to avoid strengthening the Congolese Armed Forces, thus endangering the United Nations peacekeeping mission."
"We call for the EUPOL and EUSEC missions to the DRC to be closed down."
"These missions have made a negative contribution to the escalation of violence and to the deteriorating situation in the country because they have trained security forces that have gone on to commit crimes against their own civilian population."
"United Nations resolutions concerning an embargo on the supply of arms to the DRC must be implemented."
"We wish to report that several Member States of the European Union are violating that embargo."
"The joint resolution tabled by the other political groups does not refer to these fundamental points, and I have therefore voted against it."
"This joint motion for a resolution on the Democratic Republic of Congo reflects the complicated situation in this African country."
"Despite the large amounts of human resources and funding provided by the international community, it has not yet been possible to bring peace and stability to the area."
"On the contrary, the UN soldiers are being accused of taking sides and of helping to escalate the situation further."
"It is important that this issue is resolved."
"The huge cost of over EUR 7 billion for the UN mission, including humanitarian aid, can only be justified if it is clear exactly how the funds were used."
"As the resolution does not specifically call for this to be clarified, I have abstained."
"The massacres, crimes against humanity, recruitment of child soldiers and acts of sexual violence against women and girls that are still taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo cannot leave us unmoved."
"Further efforts are needed to put an end to the activities of foreign armed groups in the east of the DRC."
"The international community cannot look on helplessly."
"It must ensure that the March 2009 agreements on the ceasefire are respected effectively and in good faith."
"Two recent reports of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights show that the humanitarian situation is worsening considerably."
"MONUC plays a vital role, but its mandate and rules of engagement must be implemented with determination and on a permanent basis in order to guarantee the population's security more effectively."
"MONUC's presence remains necessary."
"Every effort must be made to allow it to carry out its mandate in full in order to protect those under threat."
"The Council must play a leading role and ensure that the United Nations Security Council supports MONUC by reinforcing its operational capacities and providing a better definition of its priorities, of which there are currently 41."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting"
"(PT) Mr President, I have a point of order."
"This morning we held a vote here to justify negotiations that existed between the European Union and Morocco."
"Since a Commission document has just come out, dated today, saying that EU - Morocco negotiations on the agri-food and fisheries sectors are progressing, I should like to know if it was these negotiations that the Chairman of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was referring to this morning when he used the negotiations as an argument to delete from today's agenda the topic on Aminatou Haidar, the Sahrawi fighter who has been on hunger strike for 32 days and is in a life-threatening condition at this very moment."
"This, then, is a point that needs to be duly clarified, because what happened here this morning is unacceptable."
"Thank you, Mrs Figueiredo."
"Unfortunately, I cannot give you an answer, because I can no longer remember myself what the group chair said at midday today."
"(ES) Mr President, two items were withdrawn from the agenda this morning."
"I wish to enquire about the resolution agreed between the parliamentary groups."
"Could you please clarify under which of the Rules of Procedure was the question raised and an on-the-spot vote taken to withdraw an agenda item we were due to debate this afternoon?"
"I believe this is an important issue and that Members of the House present today need to be informed appropriately as a matter of urgency."
"Mrs Bilbao Barandica, this concerned a point of order under the terms of Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure which allows the agenda to be changed."
"I regret that I can now only permit points of order."
"We will not be restarting this debate."
"I would like to point out that I will immediately cut off any speaker who attempts to begin the debate again."
"(ES) Mr President, pursuant to Rule 177 of the Rules of Procedure, a group or at least 40 Members may indeed move that a debate be adjourned."
"This is what happened this morning, in a highly unusual manner."
"In fact, the Rules of Procedure state that if an adjournment is to be requested, the President of the House must be informed 24 hours in advance."
"The President must then inform Parliament immediately."
"I would like to enquire whether this process was followed because the situation we find ourselves in is quite extraordinary: This is the first time that the European Parliament has been prevented from debating a resolution agreed by all the parliamentary groups in response to an extremely serious situation, such as the case of Mrs Haidar."
"I would therefore like to know if this process was followed."
"If it was not, the resolution should be debated immediately."
"The resolution agreed by all the parliamentary groups must be recovered and put to the vote."
"Are there any other points of order?"
"(RO) I was only wanting to say that, in the meantime, Mr Schulz has arrived in the Chamber and we would be delighted if he could reply to the question which was asked by our fellow Member at the start while he was absent."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Preda, that was a very brief question, but it was not a point of order."
"(ES) Mr President, we, too, wish to refer to Rule 177 of the Rules of Procedure."
"With that rule in mind, we cannot understand how an item can be withdrawn from the agenda, unless this is done prior to the relevant debate or vote."
"Consequently, we also believe the Rules of Procedure have been applied incorrectly. We therefore call on the President to resolve the matter."
"As the questions refer to this point, I am happy to give you an answer."
"Under the terms of Rule 140(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the agenda can be changed under certain circumstances, including 'on a proposal from the President'."
"A point of order was raised by a group chair and the President agreed to a vote on it."
"This is in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, on a point of order, regarding my request on behalf of my group, the ECR Group, to postpone the vote that Mr Schulz called for to 15.00 to give us enough time to understand what this was all about."
"That was not actually put to the House."
"The President just put to the House the Schulz motion, and did not put my request for a motion to postpone it to give us two or three hours to cool down and find out the facts."
"I object to the fact that was not actually put to the House."
"Mr Tannock, the point of order raised by Mr Schulz is the ongoing point of order."
"Your point of order is therefore superfluous."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to emphasise what Mr Meyer has said."
"I shall be brief."
"A large number of Members, a large proportion of those present in this House, have been very surprised by the train of events surrounding this morning's proposal."
"The latter was voted through quite unexpectedly, and in a way that suggests it does not comply with the spirit of the provisions in force and is not in keeping with them."
"I have explained my understanding of the Rules of Procedure to you."
"Therefore, the procedure is in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"I am not able to acknowledge other new points of order."
"I would like to ask for your forbearance."
"We have two further important points."
"Mr Salafranca, if you have a point of order, please go ahead."
"However, I must tell you that I will cut you off, if this is not the case."
"(ES) Mr President, this is indeed a point of order."
"This morning, the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament asked for a motion for a joint resolution to be withdrawn from the agenda."
"This is an unprecedented decision, and strong arguments were adduced for it, namely that Mrs Haidar's life would be endangered."
"With this in mind, my Group did not wish to compromise the situation, bearing in mind also the views expressed by Mr Schulz."
"As I see it, however, there is no reason why a statement by this House should endanger Mrs Haidar's life."
"In particular, I cannot understand why it should be necessary to act in contravention of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, Rule 177 clearly states that submissions should be made 24 hours in advance and prior to the debate."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Salafranca, I am very sorry, but it is no longer possible for us to investigate the motives of the Members of Parliament from earlier today."
"The question of what information has been received this afternoon is no longer a subject for today's agenda."
"I will therefore return to the agenda."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that Rule 140 is not applicable to the urgency procedure and I would therefore ask you to have this checked by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, because it could set a dangerous precedent."
"I am happy to accept this suggestion, but it too was not a point of order."
"Calendar of part-sessions: see Minutes"
"1."
"Uganda: anti-homosexual draft legislation"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the anti-homosexual draft legislation in Uganda."
"author. - Mr President, I crave the House's indulgence, if we can move away from points of order and to the issue of discrimination."
"There is currently a bill before the Ugandan Parliament, and some argue: what is it to do with us?"
"Breaches of international obligations, the Cotonou agreement and breaches of human rights - as we have always shown - have everything to do with us."
"This bill's provisions are draconian and among them, let me inform the House, are: any person alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities would face fines and probably three years in prison; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a 'suspected' homosexual would risk seven years of imprisonment."
"Similarly, the bill threatens to punish or ruin the reputation of anyone who works with a gay or lesbian population, such as medical doctors working on AIDS and HIV, civil society leaders active in the fields of sexual and reproductive health, hence, further undermining public health efforts to counter the spread of HIV."
"It is vital that this afternoon in this House we put aside our prejudices and we defend those who have no one left to defend them."
"Therefore, I warmly welcome the statement by the Commissioner on Development and Humanitarian Aid, Commissioner De Gucht, statements from the British, French and Swedish Governments as well as President Obama and the Chair and Vice-Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I urge the House to give this the high importance which it deserves and to speak out for those in Uganda who currently are not being heard."
"author. - Mr President, last September, a member of the Ugandan Parliament introduced an 'anti-homosexuality bill'."
"This bill would criminalise homosexuality, leading to punishment by imprisonment and even the death penalty."
"This would not only apply to these alleged criminals but also to those who failed to report these so-called crimes, or who support human rights and other work in Uganda."
"Our concern is that this would violate freedom of sexual orientation as well as freedom of expression, which are human rights: they are not just European values but universal values."
"We also reject the death penalty as a whole and want to join the international community in its concern for NGOs which may have to cancel their activities working in Uganda."
"We therefore join President Obama and others in the international community who have called for this bill not to be approved and for the review of any laws that would criminalise homosexuality in Uganda."
"author. - Mr President, Uganda is a deeply Christian country where traditional values hold sway."
"Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda as it is in many African countries."
"We must, of course, be sensitive about forcing our more liberal and tolerant values on others, because it can sometimes be counterproductive."
"But we should not be afraid to speak out against this outrageous bill, because it is clearly a draconian and hugely disproportionate piece of legislation."
"It would not only be seriously detrimental to the safety and freedom of homosexuals in Uganda, but it would also tarnish the image of Uganda throughout the world and make it into a pariah."
"Uganda has made many great strides in the past two decades and, in some ways, can be seen as a model for Africa's development."
"Why should Uganda's parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away?"
"Why should they seek to place their country alongside brutal Iran, which regularly executes homosexuals in public?"
"Let us hope that, through our mutual outrage - in this House and in many other parliaments throughout the world - at this piece of brutal legislation, we can convince the Ugandan President to veto it."
"Mr President, some of the previous speakers have given details of this legislation which is now before the Ugandan Parliament."
"I would like to tell you a brief story."
"Around four to five years ago, I was in Kampala and one evening I met a group of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in a pizza restaurant, where the owner allowed the meeting to take place."
"On the same evening, a government minister said that raids would, in future, take place on any places where lesbians, gay men and transgender people met."
"I was rather worried that evening, as were the Ugandan lesbians and gay men."
"Luckily nothing happened, but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in Uganda."
"Now proposed legislation has been introduced which will not only make homosexuality a crime, as is already the case, but will also make it subject to the death penalty."
"So many African Heads of State, including Museveni, have done a lot for their countries, but to say on this basis that homosexuality is un-African is simply wrong."
"Homosexuality has existed in all cultures on all continents throughout all periods of history and it will continue to exist, regardless of what legislation is passed."
"I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a joint resolution supported by almost all the groups, because it is important to express our opposition to the legislation and to support lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda."
"We must not allow them to be subjected to hate laws and stand by and say nothing."
"We in the European Union have an obligation to uphold human rights all over the world and to remind the members of the Ugandan Parliament that the Cotonou Agreement, for example, states that human dignity and human rights apply to everyone and must be defended by everyone."
"I also hope that the resolution that we have presented will be adopted in its entirety, because it is important for organisations which defend the rights of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda to be supported, including by the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to answer the question, 'Why should the European Parliament concern itself with this issue?', I would say that the anti-homosexual legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament shows complete disregard for fundamental freedoms and absolutely must not be adopted."
"The Ugandan legislation in force already criminalises homosexuality."
"For years, NGOs have been sounding the alarm about the violence committed against these groups."
"The fact is, if the new law is adopted in January 2010, it will exacerbate the situation and make homosexual acts punishable by life imprisonment or by the death penalty for homosexuals who are HIV positive."
"This law would also be a major obstacle to the fight against AIDS."
"There are other laws against homosexuals in Africa."
"However, this one is exceptional because, as Mr Cashman was saying, it forces citizens to report homosexual acts within 24 hours."
"If you are the doctor, parent or teacher of a homosexual, you have to report him or her to the police, or face a prison term."
"Furthermore, this bill criminalises the legitimate work of non-governmental organisations, international donors and humanitarian associations which strive to defend and promote human rights in Uganda."
"As soon as it was presented to the government in Kampala, this bill was strongly condemned by human rights defenders throughout the world, by several states, including France, the United States ..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"and by the European Commissioner for Development, Mr De Gucht."
"Uganda must respect its obligations in accordance with international humanitarian law and with the Cotonou Agreement."
"Should the situation continue, the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, make representations to the Ugandan authorities and rethink its involvement with Uganda."
"Mrs Striffler, you had a further 12 seconds."
"You could have read slightly more slowly and then more of your fellow Members would have benefited from an even better translation."
"I advise Members who read their speeches to give them to the interpreters in advance, as this helps to improve the quality of the interpreting."
"Mr President, some people think we should not get involved with this, because defence of the rights of homosexuals is an unjustified extension of human rights."
"This is a misunderstanding."
"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognised that human rights include every person and no one must be excluded."
"A ban on discrimination because of sexual orientation is nothing new."
"The problem is that not everyone wants to recognise this kind of discrimination as a violation of human rights."
"In Uganda and some other African countries, there are voices saying that our interest in this subject is an expression of neo-colonialism, or that we are interfering in matters which are none of our concern."
"This, too, is a misunderstanding."
"For we are talking about general, universal rights."
"This is not just a whim."
"We respect the independence of Uganda and other states, but we cannot remain silent, when, instead of restricting discrimination, an attempt is being made to extend it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we have an opportunity today to talk about the anti-homosexual draft legislation submitted to the Ugandan Parliament on 25 September."
"At a time when we are seeing an increasing number of human rights violations, I feel it is crucial, in the light of this anti-freedom law, for the European Parliament to look beyond the divisions that separate its political families and be able to condemn this bill in the strongest possible terms and to call on the Ugandan Parliament to reject the bill and to review its national legislation in order to decriminalise homosexuality."
"As Mr Cashman pointed out just now, every single NGO has spoken out against this bill, regarding it, moreover, as a serious obstacle to the fight against AIDS."
"The Commission, through Commissioner De Gucht, and a large majority of the Member States - adding their voice to the statements made by President Obama - have already condemned this initiative."
"I therefore call on the Commission to rethink our involvement with Uganda if this bill is adopted."
"A country that, at that point, would be in violation not only of international law but also of the fundamental principles of the Cotonou agreements could not continue to benefit from the support of the European Union."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that everyone must have the right to freedom of sexual orientation, without fear of imprisonment or death."
"This principle is not open to debate."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would have liked to start this debate by talking about the case of Aminatou Haidar."
"However, due to the reasons we already know, I cannot."
"In any case, the question of the eligibility rights in Uganda also deserves our attention, and this reminds us that once again, we are forced to adopt a new text condemning homophobia."
"In the past, we have adopted several resolutions on that problem, including protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies."
"Today, we need to add the new text to those already adopted."
"The only attempt by a Ugandan MP to table the anti-homosexuality bill deserves a political response."
"This proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian, gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty."
"The draft also includes a provision that could lead to the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone, including heterosexual people, who fail to report within 24 hours the identities of everyone they know who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or who supports human rights for people who are."
"That means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well."
"We have to remind the European Union and the international organisation that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual right to privacy guaranteed by international human rights law, according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted, whilst freedom of expression should be guaranteed."
"We ask international donors, both governmental and non-governmental, to cease their activities in certain fields should the bill pass."
"I strongly reject any move to introduce the use of the death penalty."
"If those requests are not met by the Ugandan authorities, then we should call on the Council and Commission to reconsider their engagement with Uganda, should the bill pass into law and breaches of international human rights law take place."
"For that reason, I wish to remind the Ugandan Government of its obligations under international law and under the Cotonou Agreement, which call for universal rights to be respected."
"(PT) Europe must intervene on this matter with all the tools it has available, particularly within the scope of the Cotonou Agreement."
"We must demand the immediate withdrawal of this draconian bill; otherwise there will be consequences for economic and political cooperation with Uganda."
"When I learnt about the content of this proposed legislation and when I heard reports about the sad fate of homosexuals in Uganda, Sudan, Iran and Nigeria, to mention just a few examples, I realised how deplorably deep-rooted homophobia still is in many cultures, in blatant violation of those countries' human rights obligations."
"The role played by far-right evangelical Christians in the United States in mobilising and financing several initiatives of this kind in Africa is shocking."
"Europe and its institutions must do all they can on the ground in the countries in question to neutralise and fight the evil, obscurantist influence of these agents of intolerance, who are instigating a new wave of hate crimes in Africa."
"(ES) Mr President, concerning the Ugandan bill which has provoked such indignation amongst us, I very much welcome the fact that the Members of the different parliamentary groups in the House who have taken the floor on this subject have spoken with one voice."
"I believe this is indicative of unanimity across the Chamber."
"I have asked for the floor simply to add my voice to theirs before voting accordingly later."
"I support Mr Cashman, the authors and group spokespersons."
"My reasons are that the fight against intolerance, discrimination and, in this case, also homophobia and the death penalty, requires us to be very firm and call upon the Commission and the Council to be firm too."
"We must persevere until we succeed in bringing about the withdrawal of this iniquitous bill."
"Taking the bill forward would be tantamount to returning Uganda to colonial conditions."
"(RO) I, too, wish to say that I am appalled by the way in which the law we are discussing is presented."
"It goes without saying that we cannot accept in Europe sanctions being imposed against a person for their sexual orientation and for failing to provide information about a person's sexual orientation."
"I would also like to stress that the discussion we are having is taking place in the context where the second review of the Cotonou Agreement is being discussed."
"Uganda is a party to this, and this agreement very clearly sets out the need to respect human rights."
"I also voted on Monday this week, as part of the Committee on Development, for a report by Mrs Jolie on this topic of the Cotonou Agreement."
"I believe that today's discussion, although it could have taken place earlier last month, puts us in this position where we obviously cannot but reject what is happening in Uganda."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to contribute to this debate by reminding everyone that a Review Conference of the International Criminal Court Statute is to be held in Kampala, Uganda, next May."
"It is now actually 10 years since this important criminal court was founded, and I would hope that the Ugandan Government will examine its own legislation from every angle to ensure that it is in line with international agreements and will comply with the principle of non-discrimination."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned over the draft anti-homosexuality bill introduced recently in the Ugandan Parliament."
"The bill, if adopted, raises serious human rights issues which are of great importance to the Commission."
"The Commission considers that the penalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the bill, would go against the UN human rights conventions."
"Uganda has ratified these conventions. Thereby it has the legal obligation to respect them, without distinction or discrimination."
"Domestic legislation must be consistent with international human rights obligations."
"The bill would also go against the EU-supported UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity of 18 December 2008 regarding the decriminalisation of homosexuality."
"Commissioner De Gucht personally raised these concerns in a letter to President Museveni last November."
"He emphasised that respect for human rights is of the greatest importance to the Commission and to the European Parliament."
"However, he expressed his confidence to the President that, under his guidance, such retrogressive legislation will not be allowed."
"The Presidency and the Heads of Mission in Uganda also raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions, during meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice, in Article 8 meetings, and with the Uganda Human Rights Commission."
"In its latest démarche on 3 December, the EU Presidency and the local troika met the acting Foreign Minister, to whom they again expressed these serious concerns, confirmed their support for fundamental freedoms and reminded Uganda of its international obligations."
"The Minister, while mentioning traditional values and cultural traditions that take time to change and alleging evidence of orchestrated campaigns to take advantage of poor people and recruit them into homosexuality, took note of the EU positions and committed himself to reporting them personally to the Cabinet and to Parliament in order to enable them to take an informed decision."
"The Commission hopes that, in the vein and in the spirit of the ongoing EU-Uganda partnership, these démarches, together with those of others, will lead to a review of the proposed legislation to make it compatible with international principles of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Azerbaijan: freedom of expression"
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on freedom of expression in Azerbaijan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has embarked on an interesting Eastern Partnership project, which has met with support and encouraging collaboration from six countries: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Azerbaijan."
"This operation is improving the relationship between the European Union and these countries and may lead to democratic and economic development of the area, albeit to a varying extent depending on the history of each country."
"Given this intelligent political strategy, in my view, it is inappropriate to hold this urgent debate on two young bloggers sentenced following events for which proceedings are still ongoing while we overlook other situations that are truly tragic, such as the recent massacre of 57 people who had come together to support a presidential election candidate in the Philippines."
"All parliamentary groups, with the exception of ours, support a motion for a resolution on Azerbaijan that is harsh and out of step with the partnership initiatives that we have undertaken."
"I am convinced that the strong views contained in the resolution put to the vote today may not only lead to the Azerbaijani Government stiffening relations with Europe, but may also have a counterproductive effect on the case of these two young people, in that this resolution could jeopardise the granting of a pardon."
"In this regard, I would like to remind you of the decision, adopted yesterday in plenary, whereby we rejected a resolution on the Aminatou Haidar case so as not to compromise the ongoing diplomatic negotiations."
"I feel that it is also contradictory that in the same session, two resolutions are being put to the vote, one on Belarus and the other on Azerbaijan, both very different in tone, when these two countries are part of the same Eastern Partnership."
"When, on 11 November this year, Europe marked the anniversary of the end of the First World War, in Azerbaijan, a sentence of several years' imprisonment was passed on some journalists who had dared to write about the country's widespread corruption and unemployment."
"The journalists were officially charged with spreading hooliganism and terrorism."
"In the ranking produced by Freedom House, Azerbaijan has the status of 'Not Free'."
"Reporters Without Borders say Azerbaijan is in 146th place out of 175 countries surveyed in terms of freedom of speech."
"Disturbing signals are also coming from analyses conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has evaluated Azerbaijan on the question of political freedoms."
"In this context, last year's refusal by the authorities in Azerbaijan to grant concessions to foreign media, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, should not surprise anyone."
"I think the time has come for the European Union to review its approach to Azerbaijan and, taking advantage of the participation of Baku in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy, to begin to exert greater pressure on the authorities there."
"In addition, I would like to add my voice to the appeal of my political group for the unconditional release of the imprisoned journalists and adequate revision of Azerbaijani law."
"author. - Mr President, Azerbaijan is signatory to a number of partnerships with the EU."
"It is active in the neighbourhood policy as well as in the Eastern Partnership."
"This does not only relate to trade."
"Azerbaijan has also signed up to respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"However, currently, these are all under serious threat with the present regime."
"Today we highlight the case of Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, which represents a crackdown on free media, free expression and civil society that is much deeper and wider than the case of merely two bloggers, as they have been called."
"They did indeed use new media like Facebook and Twitter for their youth organisation's work, but the fact is that we do not even know why they are imprisoned as evidence to defend their case has not been admitted in the trial, and the trial did not meet international standards - and, indeed, looks fabricated."
"If we cannot rely on the Azerbaijani Government to stay true to its commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of the law through the various agreements it has itself signed with the EU, then Europe cannot consider Azerbaijan to be a credible partner at all; this is also true of trade relations."
"This resolution urges the Azerbaijani Government to adhere to its own promises and to start building its legitimacy in the international community by respecting its own citizens, granting them democratic and human rights and allowing for respect of the rule of law."
"Yesterday, we awarded the Sakharov Prize in this House of the European people, and we saw a very impressive speech by the laureate, Mr Kovalev, who said that fear can only be met by freedom of thought, and freedom of thought can only be expressed when freedom of expression is actually guaranteed and when we listen to those people who are simply addressing issues such as opposition to their government, which we, as Europeans, have to guarantee in partnership with Azerbaijan in all areas."
"Mr President, the previous speaker has already mentioned some of the details of this resolution."
"The resolution was prompted among other things by an incident in July 2009 in which two young bloggers, Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, were attacked in a restaurant, went to the police to report the incident and were then arrested themselves."
"They were prosecuted and, according to all the international observers, including Amnesty International, the court proceedings were far from fair."
"For example, the video which was apparently taken in the restaurant, which clearly showed who had been attacked and that the attackers were other people and not these two bloggers, was not played."
"It is therefore clear that the judgment does not meet the criteria required by a state under the rule of law."
"I very much hope that all the evidence will have to be presented in the second trial when it takes place."
"I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a resolution which is supported by almost all the groups."
"I regret that Mr Provera's group is not joining us and instead is emphasising that we should wait for the case to resolve itself and to make use of the diplomatic channels."
"Mr Provera, I believe that it is necessary for Parliament, which is in partnership with the Parliament of Azerbaijan, to express itself clearly."
"Human rights represent a fundamental issue."
"Mrs Schaake referred yesterday to the Sakharov Prize."
"We must speak out in support of freedom of thought in all parts of the world and ensure that it is protected."
"President Aliyev has often said how important the rights of every journalist are and that they must be defended by the state."
"It is our job to remind everyone of this and I very much hope that in future, there will be another resolution on partnership between the Parliament of Azerbaijan and the European Parliament, as unfortunately this was unsuccessful two weeks ago."
"author. - Mr President, I welcome the attention drawn to the appalling and consistent crushing of human rights in Azerbaijan: no freedom for the media, dozens of journalists jailed, some beaten, some even killed in recent years."
"But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression."
"The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country."
"The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously, especially in the oil and gas industry, while 90% of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country."
"Western governments and multinational corporations act, as usual, with great hypocrisy in this regard."
"They routinely deal with the regime to facilitate doing business, and the corporations make massive profits from the exploitation of the natural resources properly belonging to the people of Azerbaijan."
"Western governments should be asked why they do not demand that the oil-well be used to transform the lives of the people, instead of propping up this regime."
"Members of the European Parliament, quite correctly, are harsh in their condemnation of the crushing of the right to dissent and to demonstrate freely in Azerbaijan, and I cannot let this opportunity pass to also condemn the disgraceful repression of protests by the Danish police in Copenhagen in recent days, who arrested up to 1 000 entirely peaceful protestors, handcuffed them and left them lying for hours in the cold."
"When I protested and demanded the release of some CWI colleagues, the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest, preventive detention."
"What goes for Azerbaijan should certainly go for a Member State of the European Union as well."
"Mr President, in Azerbaijan, for fairly mild and delicate criticism of the government, two people have gone to prison after being given stiff sentences."
"What does this mean?"
"Firstly, that the country does not have good legal institutions, and it does not look like such institutions are going to arise."
"Secondly, that Azerbaijan has an authoritarian system which is taking control of more and more areas of political life."
"Every concession is punished."
"What can we do in this situation?"
"We should certainly intervene in every specific case of the violation of justice, as we are doing in this debate."
"Such interventions have quite often been successful."
"It is significantly more difficult to force institutional change."
"To date, the efforts of the EU in this area have been unsatisfactory, partly because we are still lenient towards some tyrants and vociferous in our criticism of others."
"The representatives of Memorial mentioned this several times in this House."
"We also have problems in part because the process of coming out of authoritarianism is very difficult, arduous and prolonged."
"It is a very pessimistic conclusion, but I close with this thought: in spite of everything, we should not cease in our efforts, and should be consistent in exerting pressure."
"author. - Mr President, at the beginning of this year, the European Union made a statement on freedom and media in Azerbaijan."
"I regret the fact that, after concern on media freedom was expressed during the regular meeting with Azerbaijani parliamentarians, there has been no feedback."
"The European Parliament therefore has to take a stand."
"This is, by the way, going to be our last resolution adopted in 2009."
"The main concern of the EPP Group, and I am happy that all factions share the same concern, is the deterioration of media freedom in that country."
"The widespread practice of harassment, persecution and conviction of opposition journalists is alarming."
"We call on Azerbaijani authorities to release the journalists in jail without further delay."
"This also concerns two young bloggers."
"The second problem is a recent decision by Azerbaijani authorities to cancel the FM radio licences of several international radio stations like Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, BBC World Service and others, depriving listeners in this country of valuable and independent sources of information."
"Here I ask colleagues to agree to an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution: namely, not only to voice regret at the situation, but also to urge the Azerbaijani Government to cancel its decision and renew FM licences for the radio stations mentioned."
"Variety, freedom and independence of information are key to a robust civil society, as Sergei Kovalev told us yesterday in this Chamber."
"This applies fully to the EU's relations with Azerbaijan too."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Azerbaijan is an important partner of the European Union."
"It is certainly an essential partner in efforts to ensure European energy security."
"However, no matter how important oil and gas are, they are not everything."
"Azerbaijan has made commitments to work for a democratic and pluralistic society, as enshrined in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Eastern Partnership policy, in which Azerbaijan intends to participate fully."
"We should applaud steps in the right direction taken by President Aliyev, for example, to free 119 prisoners, including five journalists, at the end of 2007."
"However, the situation of media freedom is only getting worse."
"We have a number of cases to support this claim, such as the situation of bloggers, the licences of the BBC, Radio Free Europe, etc."
"We must not shy away from reminding Azerbaijan that people must have the right to speak out freely, even if this means having critical views towards their governments."
"That is the basic principle of a democratic society, and a democratic Azerbaijan has to be an aim just as important as..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy."
"Azerbaijan ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and has undertaken to observe the provisions of Article 10 of this convention, which is devoted to freedom of expression and information."
"This Article establishes every person's right to freely express their opinion, receive and share information, without let or hindrance from governing institutions."
"Azerbaijan also has made a commitment not to flout human rights and not to impinge on individual freedoms and to safeguard the principles of democracy in its country by participating in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership initiative."
"However, recently in Azerbaijan, the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association has increasingly come under threat and media activities are restricted."
"There is growing violence against journalists and civil society activists."
"I would like to urge Azerbaijan to take into account the European Parliament's proposals and encouragement to improve the human rights protection system and to ensure respect for media freedoms."
"Mr President, Azerbaijan has appeared once again on the agenda of the European Parliament."
"We spoke about Azerbaijan in the last parliamentary term, when we adopted three resolutions, including one about freedom of the media there."
"We also spoke about the Southern Caucasus, again including Azerbaijan."
"We are interested in Azerbaijan and have a great deal of goodwill for the country."
"It is trying to find its way step-by-step, and, indeed, is moving ever nearer to the western world, and not to the east."
"We should appreciate this."
"I think that we look upon Azerbaijan with a great deal of goodwill, and also on the authorities there."
"However, that goodwill must not order us not to speak out about things we do not like."
"Certainly, a situation in which two bloggers are locked up because they say what they think about the authorities is something which should not take place."
"We should support the pro-European tendencies of the Azerbaijani authorities, because all the time, a political discussion is going on there about whether to be closer to the European Union or to Russia."
"In so doing, we should support all those who want to be closer to the western world."
"However, when supporting them, we must talk about the values which make up that world - freedom of the press and freedom of expression are a fundamental value, and we should make this very plain."
"Azerbaijan is certainly not in an easy position, because Russia is trying to rebuild its area of political and economic influence, but when helping the Azerbaijani authorities to draw nearer to the EU, we must speak out about the country's deficiencies."
"Freedom of expression is a very important feature of a democratic society."
"It is therefore correct that the EU monitors very carefully any actions aimed at intimidating those who openly criticise the mistakes of government officials."
"From this perspective, I understand the challenge of the European Parliament to the Azerbaijan office expressing disquiet over the results of a police investigation mounted against young people who make satirical references to visible shortcomings in the political life of the country."
"I agree that we cannot ignore the clearly unfavourable signals coming from Azerbaijan and I do not doubt the criticism of the political environment in Azerbaijan, but I also feel that there has been no emphatic criticism from the European Parliament concerning the current events in the Philippines, where 57 political hostages have been murdered."
"In my opinion, we should address all issues that shake the democratic world."
"(DE) Mr President, following the first European elections in 1979, I had the honour of working with Otto von Habsburg, who is now seriously ill, to establish the human rights tradition of the European Parliament, including these topical and urgent debates on a Thursday afternoon."
"I was elected to the European Parliament in 1994 and I had the honour of working with Mr Schulz and others to further develop this human rights tradition, which we are rightly proud of."
"For this reason I was shocked when Mr Provera said with reference to Mr Schulz, who did not deserve this, that the case should not be taken up and almost repeated the threats made by the regime in Azerbaijan to civil rights activists in the country by saying that they will have to put up with it."
"The human rights prize has already been mentioned today."
"I remember well that when we expressed our support for Andrei Sakharov, Vytautas Landsbergis and other campaigners for civil rights, people said at the time: Please do not get involved."
"We will make use of the diplomatic channels and you are causing more harm than good."
"Now we know that it was decisive for these people that Parliament spoke out clearly on their behalf."
"Therefore, Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, let us continue our tradition of independence on a Thursday afternoon."
"I would like to ask the group chairs to give us some freedom to act."
"This has nothing to do with party politics."
"During the last session, one Member said that as we were just about to hold meetings with China, we could not talk about China."
"Today it was a different subject, the Western Sahara."
"Perhaps this is justified in individual cases, but I am seriously concerned about our human rights work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the case of Azerbaijan demonstrates how important it is to be discerning here."
"The country was a Soviet satellite state."
"Monocultures were established, the country was destroyed and subjected to a brutal regime."
"Now it is slowly beginning to become more democratic."
"As a member of the Council of Europe, it has committed to human rights and we must help it to continue along this route."
"(Applause)"
"(RO) I, too, support what Mr Posselt said earlier."
"At the same time, I would ask for the Azerbaijani Government to respect the right of freedom of expression of every citizen and to immediately drop the charges against the two young men, accused on the basis of fabricated evidence, as Mrs Lunacek mentioned earlier."
"I believe that this action must be taken urgently because the situation with regard to press freedom in this country has deteriorated sharply, as is also indicated by the latest reports from the Council of Europe and OSCE."
"I also think that the Azerbaijani Government must take this action urgently because it must respect the commitments arising from both the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership."
"I will conclude by saying that I, too, was shocked by the turn of events today with regard to Mrs Haidar, all the more so as the suffering she is going through could be avoided through good cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish authorities."
"I believe that our resolution would not have done any harm, but actually a lot of good."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to quote from Article 47 of the Constitution of Azerbaijan: 'Everyone may enjoy freedom of thought and speech.'"
"Unfortunately, they are only empty words, for the constitution is not respected."
"For over five years, I have been a member of the EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committees."
"I visited Azerbaijan during every joint parliamentary session."
"In one of the documents, there is a point about the violation of the principles of freedom of speech, and about how journalists and publishers end up in prison, often on fabricated charges, and that they are not given medical help when they are ill."
"We have a case of a journalist who died because he did not receive medical assistance."
"I had the opportunity to visit Azeri prisons."
"The standards which are found there are far different from those to which we are accustomed in Europe."
"It is good, therefore, that we keep on saying that in Azerbaijan, the principles enshrined in the constitution should be respected."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Azerbaijan is important to the European Union as an energy producer and transit country, and also as a contributor to regional stability in the Southern Caucasus."
"Azerbaijan is one of the six partner countries under the Eastern Partnership, and we attach great importance to respect for the common values underpinning this relationship."
"A partnership and cooperation agreement has been in place for 10 years."
"However, Azerbaijan has expressed its interest in building closer relations with the European Union by concluding an association agreement to replace it."
"Following the decision of the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in September to start preparations for concluding such agreements with the Southern Caucasus countries, discussions on the negotiation directives, including for Azerbaijan, are now ongoing."
"In line with the Council's decision, the start of negotiations for all the Southern Caucasus countries will be conditional on sufficient progress in meeting the necessary political conditions, namely the rule of law and respect for human rights, the principles of the market economy, as well as sustainable development and good governance."
"Each year, we draw an in-depth and balanced assessment setting out progress made by each partner country to implement their action plans under the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"We have just started the preparatory work for the 2009 report."
"I do not want to pre-empt our report but would like to make a few remarks, particularly on the situation regarding fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"In our 2008 report, we stated that 'Azerbaijan has made good progress in economic development, but continues to show a poor record of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law'."
"Since then, we have unfortunately seen some negative developments, including changes to the Constitution, the abolition of limits on the mandate of the Head of State, as well as the detention and subsequent condemnation of two bloggers."
"Negative developments also include the continued persecution of human rights defenders, opposition activists and journalists, in addition to further deterioration of media freedom."
"The European Union has, in its various contacts, taken up these issues at all levels with the authorities and will continue to do so."
"At the same time, the Commission is mobilising a wide range of tools to assist Azerbaijan to meet the challenges of a new agreement."
"We are using assistance under the ENPI instrument."
"We provide targeted support under the comprehensive institution-building programme."
"This will have important elements related to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary."
"Azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"Lastly, under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement, we are proposing to set up a subcommittee dedicated to justice, freedom and security, and human rights and democracy."
"This will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law"
"1."
"Uganda: anti-homosexual draft legislation (vote)"
"2."
"Azerbaijan: freedom of expression (vote)"
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group, I propose the following oral amendment to paragraph 7: the words 'deplores the Azerbaijani authorities' decision not' should be replaced with the words 'urges the Azerbaijani authorities'."

"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the last sitting of this year."
"I am pleased that the new Members have settled in so well over the last few months."
"I wish you all a Happy Christmas and a successful start to 2010."
"I hope that you will all be able to say at the end of 2010 that it was a good year."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 16.10)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 17 December 2009."
"Statements by the President"
"It is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Mrs Boal, deputy head of the European Union Delegation to Haiti, is, unfortunately, still missing."
"The search for Mrs Boal continues."
"She used to work in the European Parliament."
"Today, the Haitian nation, hit by the great tragedy of the earthquake, is in the thoughts of every one of us."
"Individual countries of Europe, as well as the whole European Union, have pledged substantial financial assistance for Haiti, along with deployment of 150 police officers as part of the European Gendarmerie."
"Teams sent by individual EU countries are also working there."
"This is the worst cataclysm in the history of Haiti, and one of the worst in the history of humanity."
"In addition, many of our fellow citizens, citizens of Europe, have died there, and many are believed to be missing."
"I would like you to commemorate the victims of this unimaginable catastrophe with a minute's silence."
"Please stand."
"It was also with great regret that I received information of the execution in China of Akmal Shaikh, a British citizen."
"He is one of nearly 7 000 people who are executed in that country every year."
"He is also the first citizen of the European Union to be executed in China since 1951."
"The European Parliament condemns, and has always condemned, the death penalty, and will continue its efforts to achieve a moratorium on executions."
"Yesterday, the first round of presidential elections was held in Ukraine."
"Representatives of the European Parliament are observing the elections and were present yesterday."
"We have not yet received official information on the progress of the elections."
"Our colleagues have not sent any official information, but we are expecting some at any moment."
"We expect this to show that the elections have been conducted fairly, and that the same will be true of the second round, which will be held at the beginning of February."
"On 1 January, Spain assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union."
"I am sure that, under the new treaty and in cooperation with the new President of the Council, the Spanish Presidency will be a success and will achieve the objectives which have been set."
"In the programme of our session, we have a meeting with Prime Minister Zapatero, and we are going to talk about the Trio Programme."
"Therefore, we will not only be talking about Spain, but also about Belgium and Hungary."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me, finally, to express my most sincere wishes for prosperity and success in the new year 2010."
"May the beginning of this new decade be an inspiration to us all to work strenuously on behalf of our citizens."
"As I said a week ago in Brussels - a new year, a new treaty, and a new era for the European Union."
"Our Parliament bears particular responsibility for the future of the European Union."
"We are all aware of this."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 January 2010 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Tuesday:"
"I have received a request from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on winding up the debate on Haiti with the tabling of motions for resolution, to be put to the vote during the first session in February."
"Mr President, naturally, we also wish you all the best for the New Year."
"I would like to know whether you will be coming back to the resolution on Haiti."
"We should like to move a resolution on Haiti, which must, at all costs, be decided in February."
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a request from the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group to place on the agenda for voting time the motions for a resolution on defence of the principle of solidarity, to wind up the debate held on 15 December 2009."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons in favour: firstly, the importance of the subject - I find it a little strange for Parliament to refuse to vote."
"Everyone has their own opinions, everyone can think as they see fit, but as a Parliament, I think that we have a duty to give an opinion on this subject as each of us feels is appropriate."
"Secondly, this House has already requested and voted on the inclusion of this item as a voting item, moving it from December to January."
"Now I believe that the Bureau, or, rather, the Conference of Presidents, should not have gone against a precise and timely decision by the House, and I therefore think that the House should express its views on this point shortly."
"Mr President, we have had some very heated debates."
"We have seen that there are actually very differing opinions on these findings of a court of justice that is not an EU court."
"We should not now lapse once again into a debate on this very serious topic, a debate that divides us more than it unites us."
"We should let the subject rest."
"We had differing opinions, we still have differing opinions, and that is why we should not come back to it to try and arrive at a new resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to ask my fellow Members to keep this item on the agenda: the massacre of Coptic Christians on the day after or, in fact, on the night of Coptic Christmas, and the many killings of Christians in Malaysia are signs of a very clear problem: religious freedom in those countries."
"In itself, the resolution is not an initiative directed against individual, specific governments but a way of highlighting how the issue of religious freedom constitutes one of the foundations of our civil harmony, and it is therefore right for Parliament to express its views on this subject."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, we would like to request that the debate on relations between Tunisia and the European Union be postponed until the February part-session as, in the meantime, a meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights will be held on relations between the European Union and Tunisia, and, perhaps, new material will be available to us during that debate."
"Mr President, it is not the intention that we should now arrive at a resolution."
"It is good that we have had a discussion, but one without a resolution."
"It is also my considered view that we should draw up such a resolution only after such a visit, if we do so at all."
"The discussion, however, should certainly take place now, so that the Members who will visit that country can take with them some of the feeling in this House."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, you referred to the death penalty earlier on."
"We often talk here about the number of death penalties being carried out in China, in Iran, etc. I would like to refer to the case of a man in Ohio in the United States who, after serving 30 years in prison, also 'served' the death penalty, because he had to follow the due process."
"Serving two of the major sentences is, according to European standards, very cruel treatment."
"I think that, in our dialogue with the United States - our major ally - this issue of the death sentence should come up."
"We should also consider the other case, of somebody who served 35 years in prison and was then proved innocent."
"With the death penalty, there is no deterrence; there is no correction; there is no coming back."
"(RO) During recent weeks, Iceland has been appearing on the front pages of the press because, at the start of the year, the president of this country exercised his right of veto on the Icesave legislation and decided to submit it to a referendum."
"This decision has provoked reactions of disapproval from the British and Dutch Governments."
"I think that this is a strictly bilateral dispute which should not influence Iceland's EU accession process."
"I believe that the Commission should set out its position clearly with regard to the implications which adopting or rejecting the Icesave legislation will have in terms of Iceland's fulfilment of the economic criteria drawn up by the Copenhagen European Council."
"Mr President, 'let us not allow fear to guide us', we often say."
"Some people question whether our airport security measures are too tight."
"Well, the Detroit terror attempt made us realise that our security systems are not excessively tight, but are still rather unsatisfactory."
"As you all know, the Slovakian secret service placed plastic explosives in the bag of a Slovakian citizen."
"The passenger, as well as the bag, got on board without any problems and landed in Ireland."
"No doubt the test was spectacular, but certainly it did not strengthen the belief of citizens that security, on the one hand, and the right to privacy, on the other hand, are taken seriously by the authorities."
"Citizens are flooded with conflicting information and misinterpretations in the press on a daily basis."
"After Detroit, to give you an example, the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) The Lisbon Strategy stipulates that the EU should become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in 2010."
"Here we are now in 2010."
"The strategy's objectives are far from achieved and the EU is facing the deepest economic crisis since 1933."
"Although these objectives have not been met, they must remain a priority on the European Union's agenda."
"The Spanish Presidency, in the person of Prime Minister Zapatero, has assured us that the strategy's objectives will continue to be pursued, setting 2020 as the deadline."
"It is unacceptable, after this time, for us to wait another decade to achieve the anticipated results."
"One of the strategy's key points is investment in education and research."
"No economy in the world can develop without having an educated society."
"This is why I believe that the funding of education systems must be a priority for Europe."
"I deplore today in this Chamber this policy devoid of any vision, pursued by governments who are reducing their education budgets, because not only are they doing harm to today's society, but they are also creating long-term problems."
"I would like to take this opportunity to announce that I am also submitting a written statement which can be signed starting from the next sitting."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to come back to the subject of the installation of body scanners in airports."
"Today, this is presented to us as the solution to the terrorist threat but, at the same time, it fuels a sense of fear."
"Some Member States are charging ahead, without having even studied the impact of such a measure in terms of public health, security and, above all, civil liberties."
"Let us be realistic, there is no such thing as 100% security."
"There may be a momentary lapse of concentration, a human error."
"Moreover, the example of the failed attack on the Amsterdam-Detroit flight has particularly demonstrated the flaws in information systems."
"It is therefore in this area that we must find solutions in order to move towards a culture of exchange and of trust between the different authorities and parties involved."
"Finally, targeting only airports means completely ignoring the possibility of acts by ill-intentioned groups in railway stations, underground systems or in any other places where people gather, and there are a great number of these."
"Therefore, before making any rash and costly decisions, let us first regain the initiative with a wide-ranging and transparent debate that is objective and unemotional."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as an MEP for the north-west of Italy, I would like to point out to Parliament and the Commission some suspected infringements of existing treaties and democratic rights which are being perpetrated by the Italian Government and by Piedmont's local authorities in relation to the plan for a new railway line between Lyon and Turin."
"The substantial funding from Europe for this line was conditional upon the project being backed by local populations and the existence of funding from private Italian investment."
"These two conditions have not been met because, on the one hand, the private Italian funds do not exist and, on the other, the local communities have been silenced by a government decree which allows them to talk only if they agree with the existence of the railway line."
"Since these two conditions have not been met, the suspicion is that Italy is, in a way, defrauding Europe."
"(FR) I am sorry, Mr President."
"This is my first time, I checked that the procedure was correct and meanwhile ... please accept my apologies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the year that the UN has declared the 'International Year of Biodiversity', I would like to draw your attention to the failure of the 2004-2010 European Strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity."
"40% of our natural heritage is under threat."
"The state of biodiversity is a measure of the state of health of the planet, of the state of health of our development system, and the crisis phenomenon is accelerating."
"Therefore, I hope that, today and tomorrow, the European Union and the European Parliament will be able to rise to the challenges and come up with ambitious and wide-ranging objectives to halt the loss of biodiversity in all sectoral policies in 2010."
"We must act, there is still time, and 2010 is a year in which anything is possible."
"I hope we will be able to do better than we did in Copenhagen."
"(DA) Mr President, since Turkey banned the Kurdish DTP party, many party members have been arrested, including democratically elected mayors and former members of parliament."
"I myself visited Turkey between Christmas and New Year in order to be present at the legal proceedings against the Chair of the DTP, Ahmet Türk. The police were sent after him despite the fact that his parliamentary immunity had not been rescinded."
"Last week, the mayor of Diyarbakir, Osman Baydemir, was banned from leaving the country."
"As a result, he is unable to attend the conference on Kurdish issues that is to be held here in this Parliament on 3-4 February."
"That is why I call on the President - and I hope the President has time to listen to my entreaty - to lodge a protest with the Turkish authorities and demand that the democratically elected mayor of Diyarbakir be allowed to visit the European Parliament next week."
"Thank you for your remarks."
"Please send me a note about this to my e-mail address, so that I know exactly which matter you have in mind."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the freedom of expression is under great pressure in the Netherlands."
"The leader of our party, Geert Wilders, has to appear before a Dutch court next week."
"This is not because he has committed any crime, but because of his political views."
"The Party for Freedom warns of the consequences of Islamification."
"Islam is no religion, it is an ideology that wants to take us over."
"Islam has no love for Western freedom and democracy."
"Expressing criticism of Islam is often costly for politicians and opinion-makers because of threats by fundamentalists."
"The fact that politicians in the Netherlands, by criticising Islam, will now even have the Public Prosecution Service and the courts on their backs, and potentially find themselves in prison, is catastrophic for our freedom and our democracy."
"We cannot let that happen, and that is why we are sounding the alarm bells for the Netherlands and the free Western world."
"End Islamification and end the prosecution of politicians on the basis of their political views!"
"This coming Wednesday, we will be in the Netherlands to demonstrate for our freedom."
"Support Geert Wilders and attend this outrageous political trial of a brave politician, Geert Wilders!"
"(RO) I welcome that the Spanish Presidency is undertaking, based on the programme it has proposed, projects which will strengthen and transform the European Union through innovation and legitimisation."
"However, I regret that the Spanish Presidency's programme does not contain any specific reference to inland waterways, in particular, the Rhine-Main-Danube waterway, even though, during last year, the European Commission undertook to draft a strategy for the Danube in 2010."
"I am aware that the Spanish Presidency has numerous other priorities to tackle such as the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force and the changes in case-law, institutional amendments, management of the crisis mitigation process and restoring sustainable growth."
"However, I think that the transport infrastructure, primarily that for inland waterways, which includes the Danube, along with multimodality, are specific, viable methods of ensuring sustainable development and new jobs."
"For this reason, I believe that the lack of such an element in the Spanish Presidency's programme is a failing which must be urgently rectified."
"(PT) Mr President, fellow Members, several Member States have been severely affected by bad weather, with catastrophic consequences for farming, particularly during the last month of December."
"Portugal is one of those countries, having been hit by heavy rain on 23 December, along with hailstorms and gales which devastated the western and Algarve regions."
"This caused over EUR 80 million worth of damage and affected around one thousand farmers, who lost their crops and have been left with no way of resuming production in the coming months."
"For instance, the greenhouse crops campaign has been irretrievably destroyed for 2010, and 90% of the infrastructure cannot be repaired."
"Against this backdrop, and bearing in mind, firstly, the cyclical nature of natural catastrophes, which we can expect to increase in number and intensity due to climate change; secondly, the inadequacy of the aid that is always needed due to losses; and thirdly, the fact that these catastrophes are not covered by the European Union Solidarity Fund, we believe that the establishment of a European security system is imperative and urgent so that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to express my condolences and solidarity for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti."
"This devastating earthquake, which has come after the four hurricanes last year, should not cause us to forget the situation that the country was in beforehand, with 80% of the population in poverty."
"With the highest infant mortality rate in America, poverty, violence and exodus were already a part of daily life for a large proportion of the Haitian population."
"Under these circumstances, not only do we need to send humanitarian aid, but we also need to ensure that the efforts continue when Haiti ceases to be front page news, and that Haiti develops in a sustainable, coordinated and balanced way."
"(RO) Three years after their accession to the European Union, Romanians and Bulgarians do not enjoy full rights as European citizens."
"Although the free movement of labour is a fundamental principle of European integration, 10 Member States still maintain barriers against Romanian and Bulgarian citizens."
"The decision has been made to extend the restrictions on access to domestic labour markets, in spite of the recommendations made by the European Commission, which indicate that the mobility of Eastern European workers has not upset labour markets and has actually generated economic growth."
"Unfortunately, the economic crisis is now being used as an argument for maintaining these restrictions, with references to domestic unemployment and the pressure exerted by immigrants on labour markets."
"However, the reality is that the possible consequences of the influx of labour from the new Member States are being exaggerated and, furthermore, maintaining the barriers is hampering the deployment of the full labour potential available for exiting the current crisis and facilitating the European economy's recovery."
"This is why I hope that the new European Commission will act with greater conviction against these protectionist measures which are restricting in a discriminatory manner the free movement of labour in the European Union."
"(ES) What would you think, ladies and gentlemen, if police officers accompanied by cameras from the country's main television channels broadcast your arrest live?"
"How would you feel if you were accused of belonging to an armed group, arrested and kept isolated for five days, and then you had your assets frozen and were put in prison for up to a year and a half for being the directors of the only newspaper that was published at the time in the Basque language, which was closed down without a hearing?"
"Moreover, the majority of the prisoners have reported that they were tortured."
"What would you think if, seven years later, despite the public prosecutor asking for the case to be closed due to a lack of evidence, you were still awaiting trial?"
"What do you think about there being another part of the case, the financial case, which is also awaiting trial?"
"This has been the situation for ten people, the majority of whom are journalists, since February 2003, when the Spanish National High Court decided to close down the newspaper Egunkaria without a hearing."
"After all this, a trial is currently being held, which, given the time that has passed and the circumstances described, is anything but fair for the defendants and their rights."
"(DA) Mr President, nearly a year ago, this Parliament adopted my report on the consequences of the violent and brutal urbanisation policy in Spain."
"The report, which was adopted with a very broad majority, expressed serious concern at the many breaches of common EU legislation that had occurred in this connection, as well as of the fundamental principles on which the EU is based."
"For example, many citizens living in Spain - including a large number of EU citizens from other Member States - are finding that they are having to pay the price for the corruption and other abuses carried out by property companies, entrepreneurs, officials and even elected representatives."
"They are seeing their homes demolished."
"These are houses that they purchased in good faith, but they are not even being compensated for this."
"We have not yet had any response from the Spanish Government to all the criticisms raised in the report."
"I would therefore ask that you formally ask request the Spanish Government to state its position on the conclusions of the Auken report to the European Parliament."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the horrifying events unfolding in Italy, where immigrants working illegally in the agricultural sector are falling victim to an unprecedented wave of acute xenophobia and racist violence."
"To be precise, over 1 500 immigrants have abandoned their homes or are being forcibly removed by the authorities in the town of Rozzano."
"The recent criminalisation of illegal immigration in Italy is translating into greater exploitation of illegal immigrants and is restricting their access to employment, housing and basic services."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to investigate the possibility of transposing the provisions of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families into the legislation of the European Union."
"Our objective must be to prevent such situations in the European Union."
"Ms Auken, could I ask you to send me some brief information on the matter so that I can do that in the very near future."
"(PL) Mr President, several weeks ago, the European Commission rejected a request from the Polish Government to provide assistance for the restructuring of agricultural holdings which produce tobacco."
"That decision means the collapse of around 15 000 small family holdings which produce tobacco, mainly in the south-eastern part of Poland."
"This area is one of the poorest in the European Union."
"I do not know the reasons for this decision of the Commission, but even if it was because of formal errors made by the Polish Government, bureaucratic procedures should not bring living people and their situation to ruin."
"Therefore, I would ask the European Commission to look at the matter once again and to consider granting the Polish Government's request out of concern for poor farmers."
"(PT) Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Mr Triantaphyllides, has already described the exploitation of foreign labour that is occurring in Calabria, southern Italy."
"I must add that there is a worrying racial aspect to this issue: the black immigrant labourers work separately, live separately and were removed separately by the police, having been fired upon and urged to leave the area around Rozzano, Calabria."
"Now that some of them are in deportation centres, waiting to be deported, we must ask whether the Italian authorities acted in good faith when they said that they would protect them, given that they are now deporting some of them."
"Can we, with a clear conscience, deport people who have been the victims of racial persecution?"
"Can the Republic of Italy, a Member State of the European Union, put an end to the ethnic cleansing that was started by criminal members of the Calabrian mafia, the N'Drangheta?"
"Moreover, is it acceptable that the victims were not even informed of their rights?"
"We must carry out a thorough investigation into this matter, and for this to take place, none of the victims of the events in Rozzano may be deported."
"Mr President, the current focus of global politics is the future of our planet."
"Yet, amidst discussions about an increase in world population, the European Union has failed even to give clear direction on concerns that surround migration."
"Instead, measures to promote the movement of people are promoted with the usual justifications of filling brain drains and boosting economies."
"According to EU figures, 1.7 million European migrants came to the UK last year, nearly double the number five years ago."
"Just before Christmas, Serbia applied for EU membership, and Croatia could join as soon as 2012."
"We have yet to feel the full impact of the freedom of movement for workers enshrined in the Treaty of Rome."
"In the case of the 10 countries which joined the EU in 2004 - among them Poland, the Czech Republic and Latvia - the door is not fully open until next year."
"In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, it is 2014."
"Given that the living standards in both countries are very low, I can only imagine that this will have a significant impact on the more developed Member States."
"The rest of Europe may look on critically when we demand vetoes on immigration policy."
"The Lisbon Treaty gives the EU almost as much power over such issues as the CAP gives to our agricultural policy, and it would be totally irresponsible to ignore the impact of all the..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, In theory, the European Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and on the rule of law."
"These principles are shared by all Member States."
"Unfortunately, this is so only in theory, because Slovakia is in contempt of the principles of the EU every day."
"I propose therefore that the EU take the necessary legal measures to suspend Slovakia's EU membership until they revoke the extremist, racist language law which humiliates Hungarians every day."
"Unfortunately, Slovakia is not the only country in the Carpathian Basin that excels in offending EU principles."
"Romania is also waging a political campaign for the oppression of Hungarian minorities."
"Due to the total dispossession of the more than 300 000 Hungarians in the region known as Partium (Western Romania), the time has come to open wide the topic of local Hungarian self-government in these regions, as well as of autonomy for the Székely Lands (in Transylvania)."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 22 October 2008, the President of the European Parliament and the Council declared 2010 to be the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"At present, 78 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty, of whom 19 million are children."
"Today, in the light of the effects of the economic crisis, including the increase in unemployment, there is a need to make the fight against poverty a greater priority."
"The priority of our political work should be the people and human dignity, and we cannot ignore the fact that there are people in Europe who are going hungry."
"For this reason, I believe that the European Union must now evaluate the current social situation, and, if necessary, increase the funds for implementing the initiatives needed to combat poverty."
"In order to achieve this, we need a budget."
"(PL) Mr President, you congratulated us on adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is very important."
"Today, when Haiti so desperately needs our help, we realise afresh how important it is that the European Union function efficiently."
"We must not pretend that we do not see how public debate on the treaty in many Member States was so impoverished."
"Knowledge of the treaty is very poor, and the demagogic accusations of opponents of the treaty and opponents of a strong European Union often go unanswered."
"Myths about the treaty are still circulating in public opinion."
"Today, when the Treaty of Lisbon is now in force, we have a wonderful opportunity to run an information campaign about the treaty and the Union."
"Nowhere in the European Union must this opportunity be squandered."
"We must not miss this chance."
"Therefore, I would ask the bodies responsible for social communication in the European Union to use this moment of transformation to run an effective information campaign, to raise the level of knowledge about the Union and to create a European identity."
"(ES) Mr President, only a few days ago, two ETA commando units were arrested by French, Portuguese and Spanish police."
"They were going to launch terrorist attacks in Spain using explosives."
"I would like to publicly express the thanks of all victims of terrorism in Spain for the cooperation of Portuguese and French police in this important event."
"This is also what it means to be part of Europe."
"I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that almost a thousand people have died in Spain due to the terrorist activities of ETA, and that there is no reason, either political or moral, no reason at all that justifies terrorism."
"I would like to thank France and Portugal for their cooperation in the fight against ETA."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the situation at the eastern border of the Baltic States."
"For many years now, before each Christmas, there has been a continual blocking of trucks from all over Europe at the EU's eastern external borders."
"This situation causes serious disturbances both for the carriers and for the EU companies."
"It places even more strain on relations between the EU and neighbouring third countries."
"I believe that the newly established European External Action Service needs to react to this current situation and to cooperate more actively with the third countries involved to resolve this situation."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is being threatened with strangulation."
"Subjected to a strict Israeli blockade since 2007, in 2009, Gaza's population suffered the bloody attack that prompted the Goldstone Report, which was damning for the Israeli military authorities accused of war crimes."
"Today, it is the Egyptian authorities that have set about building an underground metal barrier in order to prevent any supplies getting through the tunnels."
"When will there be a stop to this collective punishment imposed on men, women and children, whose suffering is being manipulated on a political stage from a different era?"
"The European Union must act."
"The European Union has all the trumps as Israel's main economic partner and the principal contributor of aid to the Palestinian Territories."
"The Israeli Government will only accept a change of policy under pressure from the international community."
"The EU can play a decisive role in the resumption of the peace process and in the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the borders established in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital."
"(SK) Mr President, at the end of last year, the Slovak Republic was gratuitously, shamelessly and repeatedly slandered by members of Parliament from the Republic of Hungary for adopting a law which allegedly deprives Hungarians living in Slovakia of their rights."
"While unsubstantiated rumours were being spread from Hungary about a fabricated law from Slovakia, the Slovak Republic turned to the High Commissioner for National Minorities, Knut Vollebæk, to make an objective assessment of the legislation actually adopted in Slovakia."
"Early this year, on 4 January 2010, the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities, Mr Vollebæk, issued a major statement on the State language act."
"His major statement confirmed that the State language act complies with the Slovak Republic's international commitments."
"It says that the act also complies with international standards and pursues a legitimate goal."
"It goes on to state explicitly that the steps to promote the state language do not undermine linguistic rights of persons belonging to national minorities."
"The OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities, Knut Vollebæk, praised the Slovak Republic."
"(DE) Mr President, most European Union Member States are also experiencing a devastating earthquake; one, however, that is not recognisable on the surface."
"I refer to the continuing upheaval of the financial markets."
"We now hear that in a bank in Carinthia which went bankrupt or was taken over by the state, EU funds were also in circulation."
"I hereby demand that OLAF mount the appropriate investigation."
"Under the new Presidency, there is perhaps a chance that it can act a little more independently than previously."
"In this context, I should also like to bring to your attention a study by the Corporate Europe Observatory on the 'captive Commission', that is to say, to this continuing central problem: namely that large corporations are far too heavily represented in the expert groups that should actually be looking for ways to protect us from just such upheavals."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, not to mention consumer associations and trade unions, can say next to nothing."
"Generally, the ratio in these groups of experts is 80 to 20."
"That must be changed without delay."
"Mr President, I would like to join with colleagues who raised the issue of Haiti."
"I know we will be having a debate on this during the part-session but there is one particular aspect I want to raise now and it is the fact that the United States is far better organised."
"Yes, they are nearer to the region than the European Union."
"Individual Member States have responded very well."
"We see, for example, the Belgian Air force in the vicinity."
"We are the biggest donor of aid in the world and when it comes to humanitarian aid, we should be efficient in that donation."
"I believe it is time, under the new Lisbon Treaty, to look at having, on a rolling basis, a six-month standby team including large and small Member States that will be able to deliver humanitarian aid where it is needed, on agreement between the institutions."
"It does not have to be the same standby group for each six months, it could change with the Presidency, but there should be a standby group so that we can deliver aid under a humanitarian EU flag."
"Mr President, we must urgently renew our call - and when I say 'we', I mean Parliament, the Council and the Commission - on Israel to end the siege of Gaza."
"A year ago, over 1 400 died in the war in Gaza, mostly civilians, including over 300 children."
"Yet Israel still prevents the rebuilding of homes, businesses, medical facilities, and the provision of clean water, sanitation and electricity while also blocking adequate food supplies."
"Europe must also intervene to prevent the expulsion of journalist Jared Malsin, a US citizen, and insist that he should be allowed to continue his work with Ma'an, the non-profit news agency in the West Bank."
"The Commission has blocked the fisheries agreement with Guinea because government actions there resulted in the death of 150 demonstrators."
"Why do we treat Israel differently?"
"It is time for Europe to tell Israel that our patience is at an end and that they must comply with international human rights law, including the right of the free press to be free from government interference."
"(PT) Mr President, last November, the European Commission launched a public campaign about the European Union 2020 Strategy, which will follow the so-called Lisbon Strategy, whose objectives, as we know, were much vaunted at the time, but have not been achieved, as attested by the increase in unemployment and poverty."
"The public consultation ran until the end of last week, that is, 15 January, and we are still conducting hearings for the new Commission, who will only take up their posts next February."
"Where is the sense, then, in closing a public consultation on a document of this importance at a time when the new European Commission is not yet in power?"
"We must come back to this issue, and so I would ask you, Mr President, to give particular attention to the proposal that the European Commission reconsider its position."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is, in fact, launching a new institution in the European Union - the Trio Presidency."
"There have, of course, been earlier Trios, but this is the first to have elaborated a coordinated programme and, equally, the first under the Lisbon Treaty."
"The two other Member States making up the Trio Presidency are Belgium and Hungary."
"From the Hungarian perspective, what is particularly valuable in the new institution is the opportunity to offer our own distinctive contribution to the process."
"Among other questions to be dealt with by the Trio Presidency and of particular concern is the growing problem of water shortage in Europe."
"For the first time in its history, Europe is facing a potential water shortage."
"Given its strategic location, Hungary is uniquely placed to put this issue on the European agenda."
"Mr President, two months ago, my constituency was hit by disastrous floods."
"Deceitfully blamed on climate change, the real reason for the devastation of the town of Cockermouth was the EU-imposed privatisation/theft of public services."
"The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost-cutting negligence by United Utilities, leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic-stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man-made deluge on the town."
"The fact that only one brave man died in the floods was little short of miraculous, but such disasters will increase in frequency as more and more public services are looted by greedy corporations."
"Finally, my constituents are shocked that they will not receive a penny from the EU Solidarity Fund, because the UK cannot apply unless the damage exceeds EUR 3 billion."
"Since Britain is not in an earthquake zone, it is almost impossible to conceive of a disaster which would trigger such a payment, so British taxpayers - who contribute a disproportionate amount to the funds - have no realistic chance of benefiting from it."
"So much for solidarity."
"We want our money back!"
"I should like to explain that I am also taking into account whether Members spoke during the one-minute speeches at the last part-session or two part-sessions ago: this has also been taken into account."
"However, since the ALDE Group has probably not had enough speeches, the last speaker is Mr Gallagher."
"Mr President, Haiti is a country in desperate need of help - whether it be medicine, food, water or shelter - at critical levels."
"(GA) Many people in the area affected by the earthquake are waiting for help that has not yet arrived."
"The European Union must be to the forefront of the international response aimed at providing support and help to the people of Haiti."
"To help alleviate the growing problem of food shortages, I strongly urge the European Commission to include food aid - such as processed canned fish products - as part of the EU response for the people of Haiti."
"I know that canned fish products are high in protein, have a long shelf-life and could be provided at short notice, as they were in the past."
"(GA) As such, I ask the European Commission and the Commissioners, particularly those that are responsible for development aid and fisheries, to consider this proposal as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your indulgence."
"Thank you for your speech."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the hearings are about to start."
"You are invited to attend."
"I have given the floor to 32 speakers today."
"Please remember that you have to put your name on the list in advance."
"I received a list of 72 people, and asked you to speak in exactly the order in which the names appeared on the list."
"Please put your names down as soon as possible for the speeches which will take place in a month."
"(EL) Mr President, I think that the way in which you select speakers under the standard procedure provided for in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament is biased."
"You argue that speakers are selected in order and on the basis of the following criterion: whether or not speakers were given the floor during the previous sitting of the European Parliament on the same issue under the same procedure."
"If you cross check your papers, you will see, firstly, that you gave the floor today out of order and, secondly, that you gave the floor to persons who spoke at the previous plenary sitting of the European Parliament; consequently, your arguments do not stand up."
"Finally, it is unacceptable for the President of the European Parliament to censor MEPs."
"We shall not accept that under any circumstances."
"Mr Toussas, let me explain."
"I did not give the floor to those who spoke a month ago."
"Please check the list."
"I would ask you, please, to check the list. Members who spoke a month ago were not considered."
"In addition, those who spoke two months ago had a smaller chance."
"Please check that fact."
"You can come to my office and we will check it together."
"I am not afraid of such an inspection."

"Recent earthquake in Haiti (debate)"
"The next item is the statement on the earthquake in Haiti by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton."
"We will also hear from Commissioner De Gucht, but the first to take the floor will be Baroness Ashton."
"It gives me much pleasure to welcome her because I have worked extensively with her elsewhere, and I wish her all the best in her new position."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much indeed for your kind words."
"Honourable Members, I asked for this debate to be able to update this House on the situation in Haiti following the terrible earthquake of 12 January."
"The losses are devastating and the damage is enormous."
"Up to three million people have been affected by the tragedy, and the death toll continues to mount."
"This is a massive humanitarian and political disaster."
"Our immediate focus is on working with the United Nations and the Haitian leadership to ease the suffering of the Haitian people."
"Our commitment to rebuilding Haiti is long term."
"Many European citizens have also lost their lives, and around 1 000 are still unaccounted for."
"The EU has responded quickly, not seeking headlines but with a total focus on getting help to the people in need."
"On advice from the United Nations, we resisted the urge to travel to Haiti immediately."
"That would only have diverted attention and scarce resources away from the relief effort."
"We will, of course, travel to Haiti as soon as it is appropriate, and I have agreed with Commissioner De Gucht that he will travel to Haiti this week to extend the EU's condolences and underline our commitment to the people."
"He will also take the opportunity to review our aid efforts so far and discuss with the United Nations and our people on the ground the most pressing needs for the weeks and months to come."
"In the meantime, we continue to work flat out on all tracks: humanitarian, political and security."
"Over the past days, I have been in constant contact with Secretary of State Clinton, with the United Nations leadership, with EU Foreign Ministers and with Canada, which is leading the 'Friends of Haiti' group: all this with a view to ensuring an effective and coordinated international response."
"I will travel to the United States this week to follow up on this and other issues with the United States Administration, and with the UN Secretary-General and others in New York."
"The UN has asked for urgent financial aid - USD 575 million - as well as logistical assistance to transport humanitarian aid."
"Yesterday, the United Nations Secretary-General asked for police and military reinforcements of the UN peacekeeping mission as well."
"To help mobilise and coordinate our response, I asked the Spanish EU Presidency to call an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council yesterday."
"For the first time since the Lisbon Treaty entered into effect, we are now pulling together the efforts of the Commission and the Council Secretariat, and the Member States, in a comprehensive approach, under my overall coordination."
"This is ground breaking."
"We had a productive Council meeting yesterday."
"Everyone agreed on the need for a rapid response and close coordination with the United Nations."
"In terms of financial assistance, the Council reached the following conclusions."
"It welcomed the Commission's preliminary commitment for immediate humanitarian assistance of EUR 30 million, in addition to EUR 92 million in preliminary commitments by Member States."
"It welcomed the Commission's preliminary commitment of EUR 100 million for early non-humanitarian assistance, for instance, in rehabilitation and reconstruction, and it took note of the Commission's preliminary indication that EUR 200 million would be available for longer-term responses."
"It called for, in due course and after post-emergency needs have been fully assessed, an international conference on Haiti."
"In total, this is a big response in a short time."
"Assistance will be targeted, too, to the Dominican Republic."
"Finding enough money is going to be less of a problem at the moment than getting it out to the people who need it."
"We must ensure that it is properly targeted towards sustainable political and physical reconstruction."
"Following the UN Secretary-General's request for help with transport of humanitarian aid and for additional police units, the Council invited me to identify EU Member State contributions and make proposals for this mobilisation."
"I am working on this."
"We convened a Political and Security Committee meeting immediately after the Council meeting to follow up."
"Early indications of Member State contributions are already now available, including possible contributions through the European Gendarmerie Force."
"Work will continue in the Council preparatory groups during the coming days with a view to a rapid, targeted response."
"The Foreign Affairs Council will meet again next Monday."
"We will follow up on Haiti and consider further actions."
"This is a major test of EU foreign policy in the new world of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The people of Haiti - and our own people - expect a swift, effective and coordinated response."
"This is what we believe we are delivering."
"I look forward to working with Parliament on this and am pleased to be here today to give you this information and to hear your views."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by underlining the unprecedented nature of this disaster - in terms of humanitarian impact, but also in terms of the impact on the country as a whole."
"Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world."
"It is a country in a chronically fragile situation whose existing basic functions and capacities have been very seriously disrupted."
"Also, the international community has been hard hit."
"Staff of the United Nations and NGOs and our own Commission staff are still missing, and this also explains the difficulties of organising aid on the spot."
"People have to understand that it is not out of a lack of competence, but because the aid community has itself been hit."
"Relief operations are not flowing as speedily as one would wish, although one sees that this is getting better by the hour."
"In other words, this is not only about saving human lives."
"We have, in fact, to save the country as a whole."
"That is why the High Representative, Cathy Ashton, called for this extraordinary Council meeting, which was a very useful tool in addressing the problem."
"Let me just very briefly focus on four main challenges."
"First, we have, of course, to address humanitarian needs."
"These are enormous and concern chiefly emergency medical care for the injured, water and sanitation - because there is risk of cholera, for example - food and shelter."
"What is lacking most is surgery, primary health care and drugs, water treatment kits, food assistance, emergency shelter and logistics support."
"What is in enough supply is search-and-rescue capacity."
"The organisational coordinating effort's priorities are to complete the needs assessment, to have a better picture of the detailed needs and to organise the transport logistics."
"That will also be addressed within the framework of the EU institutions."
"Lastly, we have to organise the coordination of international relief efforts."
"That is always very difficult in these kinds of circumstances."
"Let me stress that, only hours after the earthquake, European ECHO and MIC teams were deployed on the spot."
"They have been working there ever since to contribute to needs assessment and aid coordination."
"We are working with teams from OCHA, a United Nations organisation, and are in constant contact with John Holmes, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator."
"The second point is to build, or rebuild, the basic state capacity."
"This is very important."
"This country has to function again, not only physically - most of the buildings have disappeared - but with a lot of high officials having gone missing and state structures having been severely disrupted."
"The Council welcomes the fact that we will urgently send a team of EU experts with the specific task of assessing the most critical needs of the Haitian state and civil administration in order to provide technical assistance."
"Our diplomatic and cooperation staff on the ground are, of course, best placed to do that, but their capacity is overstretched."
"This is something that will become more and more important in the coming days."
"As the European Union and the European Commission, together with the Council, we could play a leadership role in re-establishing state institutions physically, and also in terms of people."
"Third is, of course, the plan to reconstruct the country, where we have to look beyond the immediate relief phase."
"In a few weeks, many emergency teams and means deployed at the present time will have left and there is a risk - very typical of this kind of disaster - of a second-wave disaster if we do not sustain our assistance and support."
"We must immediately set up massive, coordinated medium- and long-term common EU response plans for the crisis."
"Our services are working on this."
"This should be designed to ensure a proper division of labour among EU institutions and Member States and to ensure a linked relief rehabilitation and development approach, with a sustained and seamless transition between immediate relief and post-emergency response."
"We have been calling on all the Member States to fully engage in these efforts, and to turn into actions all our commitments for coordination and aid effectiveness."
"This is a time when the strength of our commitments will be tested and must come out strong if we are to succeed."
"Lastly, the financial response."
"As the High Representative has already outlined, the European Commission will make a major contribution, first of all in terms of humanitarian aid - EUR 30 million, of which the largest part - EUR 22 million to be exact - is completely fresh money that comes on top of the already existing humanitarian engagements we have with Haiti."
"The early recovery assistance - which is not humanitarian assistance, and what I just said about the state institutions of course comes under this umbrella - amounting to EUR 100 million, with a 50-50 balance between money redirected and fresh money, and then the longer-term reconstruction assistance, where there is now an initial amount of EUR 200 million."
"Then we will have to see where we stand."
"Now one is hearing figures in the region of USD 10 billion."
"That seems a lot to me and, in any case, cannot be matched by the Commission budget."
"We will have to see with the Pledging conference and with the Member States how exactly we are going to eventually participate in higher sums."
"That is the EU-wide package that has now been prepared on top of all the contributions that are already being made and will be made by the Member States."
"As the High Representative said, I will be going to the region - Haiti and also the Dominican Republic - tomorrow morning to have discussions with the authorities, including on the efforts to try to rebuild the state institutions."
"The President and major NGOs are on the spot."
"I will also go to the Dominican Republic."
"It is important that we also see those authorities, because they are the neighbours."
"You can already see that the situation might eventually create some overstretching at the border, so I will also see the Dominican authorities."
"That is all I have to say at the moment."
"On my return, I will report back to the Development Committee, on the Monday afternoon."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I am sure the House would like to remember the missing UN and EU staff and all of those who are missing and suffering in Haiti at this time."
"I am also glad that Commissioner De Gucht is going there and that he will report to the Committee on Development when he returns on Monday."
"That is a very welcome development."
"To use his own terms, the nature of the impact is unprecedented, and I think that that is a fair point to make in a country of this kind, which is why - and I mention this just in passing - I really do think that the European Union has to be more visible."
"Now that we have a High Representative who is a Vice-President of the Commission, that person must be more visible on issues of this kind."
"The European Union is the biggest aid donor in the world, donating 60% of aid, and we are probably the biggest donor of humanitarian aid as well."
"But, while one sees the US hospital ships there, all we see from the EU is Member States going in from Belgium and Ireland and Britain or wherever. There should be some visible EU presence."
"Why not battle groups?"
"Why not some standing groups, on a rotating basis, who would be ready to go into the area when these sort of things occur?"
"The last thing I want to say is that what has happened in Haiti is grounded in poverty, and, when this terrible tragedy eases and it goes off the screens, let us not forget Haiti."
"It is time to tackle the underlying poverty situation in Haiti once and for all."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, our thoughts today are with the people of Haiti in their tragedy, and I am sure all Members will want to send their condolences to the people of Haiti."
"It is a tragedy but, as Gay Mitchell has said, it is a tragedy in a country where 75% of people already live below the poverty line."
"As we look to the future, that is something we really need to be looking at."
"The public has responded magnificently to the challenge of helping Haiti."
"In the UK alone, GBP 30 million has been raised in just a few days - from the public, during the financial crisis - so we know that the public is behind us in our efforts to raise funds for Haiti."
"High Representative, I want to thank you for the work you have done in pulling together a quick EU response on this matter."
"We learned at the time of the tsunami that, in fact, good coordination is as important as the actual funds we put on the ground."
"It is not about which flag goes on the aid, it is about getting the aid out there, working with the United Nations to get it delivered."
"Looking to the longer term, I am pleased that there will be an international conference on Haiti."
"I think we need to look at the whole issue of Haiti, about its outstanding debt, and I hope the debt problems of Haiti will be on the agenda at the international conference."
"Haiti owes USD 890 million to the international creditors and a large part of that is to the IMF."
"The IMF has given Haiti a USD 100 million loan."
"Can we convert that into a grant?"
"There is no point impoverishing this country for another 100 years."
"So I hope you will put that on the agenda of the IMF meeting."
"I hope as well that we will address other issues, and I think you are right that the issue of the border with the Dominican Republic is equally important."
"So, thank you once again for your efforts, and I hope the whole House will work hard to find a good coordinated effort."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, can I begin by wishing the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate."
"As she knows well, and as the United Nations has stated, the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades, as the numbers of missing people, victims and deaths continue to rise."
"The human cost of this tragedy is immeasurable."
"While relief aid is beginning to arrive, we are all aware of the significant problems that aid workers are facing in trying to get assistance to those that need it most."
"Increasing security, logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the NGOs on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse."
"These are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for Haitians."
"In all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos, clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed."
"NGOs, government bodies, international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need."
"It is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately."
"The response from European citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense."
"Yesterday's announcement of over EUR 420 million in European Union humanitarian aid for Haiti shows leadership and commitment, but its delivery must be coordinated and effective."
"The European Union's stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort."
"I hope that you, Mrs Ashton, and Commissioner De Gucht, work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the United States, Haiti and elsewhere later this week."
"The long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority."
"The allocation of EUR 200 million in European Union aid to help Haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start, but, when the cameras have left and the world's attention is turned elsewhere, the European Union, as a global leader, must act and live up to its responsibility."
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones, so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims, to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility."
"However violent the earthquake was, it alone does not explain the extent of the damage."
"The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years."
"Until now, the international community has been incapable of changing anything there."
"Worse, by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work, international institutions, Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric, its economy and its institutions."
"In the 1970s, Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned."
"It used to produce 90% of its agricultural needs."
"Today, it imports more than half."
"This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production."
"Before this earthquake, Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled."
"We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies."
"From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place."
"In future, we must improve our procedures."
"However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong."
"We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term."
"The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same."
"We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs."
"I would like to compare these figures to other figures, to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks."
"That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level."
"Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary, but it alone is not enough."
"It must not, under any circumstances, supplant development aid, which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat."
"The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them, to allow them to benefit from their own resources."
"We must cancel Haiti's debt and pay off our debt to that country."
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, our hearts and minds go out to the people of Haiti in their hour of suffering."
"I commend Baroness Ashton and Karel De Gucht for what they have already said has happened and is being done."
"There is no question that there will be funds coming."
"I was present at the tsunami which hit Sri Lanka and then later Indonesia."
"I have witnessed earthquakes in Turkey."
"I watched what happened in China."
"Every time one of these things happens, we are caught short, not with water purification tablets or tents or clean water but with infrastructure."
"We say, oh, the infrastructure is destroyed."
"Of course it is destroyed."
"We need to be able to supply very rapidly an emergency infrastructure."
"How can this happen?"
"What about an aircraft carrier?"
"It has electricity, it has nuclear power, it has generators for water purification and it has helicopters."
"Could we set up a global rescue operation, ready to go at a moment's notice, that can provide makeshift harbours, temporary shelters and all the infrastructure that gets destroyed?"
"We need to think afresh as to how to save lives immediately afterwards."
"Mr President, Vice-President and High Representative, Commissioner, I would like to say, once again, that we have been deeply distressed by what the Haitian people, the children of Haiti are having to endure."
"For seven days now, they have been living, surviving in an absolute hell."
"The surge of global solidarity warms the heart, but it still has to be consolidated and better coordinated for the sole purpose of helping the Haitian people, who are thirsty, starving, homeless and deprived of the most elementary medical care."
"We salute all those men and women who are involved in this."
"The European Union has decided to release some initial funds."
"However, we cannot leave it there."
"European Union aid must be increased considerably, and the global banking system must become involved."
"European food surpluses must be shipped out to the Haitian people as a matter of urgency."
"Let us be frank."
"Our continent is truly indebted to Haiti and has a duty to make amends for so many years of domination and plundering."
"Lessons must be learned from the way this island, the pearl of the Caribbean, has been controlled by international financial institutions that have stifled it with appalling debt and the equally appalling interest linked to that debt."
"Our Parliament should declare itself in favour of the immediate and unconditional cancellation of this entire debt."
"Our group would like the conference that will soon take place in Montreal to make effective preparations for an international conference on the repair, reconstruction and sustainable development of Haiti with the people of Haiti."
"This reconstruction must be placed under the auspices of the United Nations, so that the Haitian people can recover their economic and political sovereignty."
"Haiti must not be the prize in a battle for domination between big powers."
"Thus, while we commend the United States' support efforts, we must be on guard and refuse to allow the North American leaders to use this terrible disaster as a pretext to occupy the island, to run it and to establish military bases there."
"Europe must lead by example."
"It must have only one objective, one sole concern: the people, the children of Haiti."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my deep solidarity with all those who have been hit by this natural disaster."
"In situations like this, with the large-scale destruction of buildings and infrastructure and with thousands of deaths, it is almost impossible to deliver aid effectively without having minimum conditions of public order and security."
"Any aid efforts are difficult without close coordination in collecting the necessary items and ordered distribution of aid."
"It is essential to understand what is needed, by whom and when."
"Another point to think about is that on too many occasions, the generosity of public and private donors has been betrayed and huge amounts of money have not gone to those who really needed them."
"It is therefore necessary to have a strict system of controls to prevent money being squandered or stolen, particularly in fragile countries with high levels of corruption and low levels of governance."
"Europe ought to demonstrate its own efficiency."
"I hope it is successful."
"Mr President, the horror of Haiti is shocking."
"It is only human to feel compassion for the innocent victims of the natural disaster there."
"All of us here are well paid and can afford to give."
"I will give my attendance allowance for today if every British MEP will do the same."
"However, with their taxes, our constituents cannot afford your generosity."
"Globalism has destroyed our industries."
"The banks have ruined our economies."
"EU red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon-tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty."
"The death toll in Haiti is shocking, but this winter, more than 50 000 pensioners in Britain alone will die premature deaths because of the cold and the cost of heating."
"Across Europe, the death toll will run into hundreds of thousands, but, because this truth shames the political elite and because it highlights the inconvenient truth of global cooling, this scandal will be buried as quietly as are our elderly dead."
"Hundreds of thousands of our own people are dying because of government neglect and EU cold taxes, yet you insist on throwing other people's money at a disaster in somebody else's back yard."
"That is not compassion: that is stinking hypocrisy."
"I know this place is uneasy with our Christian heritage, but as always, our Bible reveals an eternal truth that most here would rather ignore - first book of Timothy, 5:8: 'but if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.'"
"(FR) Mr President, High Representative, as was said earlier, the disaster was on an extreme scale due to the violence of the earthquake, doubtless one of the most serious in history, and we therefore fear a terrifying human death toll."
"I am nevertheless pleased with the rapid reaction of the European Commission and the Member States and with the commitment they have made to earmark a massive aid package of EUR 429 million for the emergency humanitarian aid effort and the reconstruction of Haiti."
"However, it is regrettable that the Europeans have acted in an uncoordinated manner and that the actions of the European Union are not visible enough, something that contrasts sharply with the efficiency of the US aid machine and makes us forget that the European Union is the world's biggest donor of humanitarian aid and development aid."
"The European Commission has also activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, which coordinates offers of assistance from the Member States and currently represents the crux of our crisis response system."
"Recent events confirm the need to improve the European Union's response to crises."
"A real organisation with civil protection capacities is essential, and for this reason, I would remind you of Mr Barnier's proposal, which dates from 2006 and proposes the creation of a European civil protection force; it is ready and just has to be applied."
"Moreover, the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, today spoke in favour of a rapid reaction force."
"Within a matter of days, the United States has assumed a dominant role in rescue and coordination matters."
"It is essential to recall the role of central and global coordination played by OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is best placed to carry out this coordination."
"Do not be mistaken, this is not about waging a war of flags."
"However, good organisation means saving time and money, and I think that European citizens have the right to know what the European Union is doing."
"(FR) Mr President, is Haiti condemned to misfortune?"
"Since its independence, natural disasters have given way to political catastrophes there, and here we are today faced with a tragedy of historic proportions."
"There are dead, injured, countless destroyed buildings and the ruin of national political structures and cooperation structures."
"We must beat fate."
"The European Union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort."
"We owe it to our numerous ties with Haiti, ties that are, first and foremost, historic: a former colony, Haiti was the most prosperous of them all; secondly, diplomatic: the Cotonou Agreement makes the island a privileged partner; and, finally, geographical, since Haiti is a neighbour of the European Union thanks to the outermost regions."
"Moreover, the crisis in Haiti represents the first test of the new European External Action Service, which you head up, Mrs Ashton."
"That has been conclusive up to now."
"This disaster also underlines the challenges and the improvements that we must make to this structure, since the solidarity movement of our continent aside, the US reaction raises questions about our mobilisation capacity."
"Thus, the remarkable efforts in favour of European coordination, the Member States' contributions, must not conceal the difficulty of the discussions concerning the deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force."
"While it is crucial for the European Union's expenditure to be guided by the United Nations, these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous, integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency."
"Finally, the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge."
"There is no shortage of tasks: political, administrative, economic, social and environmental."
"We are perhaps at year zero of a new era for Haiti."
"This is a major political challenge for a Europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every evening, the 8 o'clock news reminds us of the unspeakable suffering in Haiti."
"The suffering is perhaps matched only by the near worldwide compassion that surrounds it."
"This compassion is certainly spontaneous and sincere, but it is short-lived."
"The moment of truth will come in a fortnight, once the media have chosen to focus on other events."
"If someone does not pick up the baton, then Haitians will once again risk finding themselves alone, abandoned to their own fate."
"In a country in which everything remains to be done, starting with rehabilitation and reconstruction, it is important to act so that the different sequences lead to genuine development."
"As for the European Union, it has an extensive range of tools and solid experience in this area."
"This is why the challenges faced by Haitian society, which is desperately poor, also represent a moment of truth for the European Union."
"It is in the coming days and months that we will have to act in an effective and determined manner."
"This is the most important aspect from the point of view of recovery once we have restored conditions of security and public order, which are essential for any coordinated action in a country in which everything has been damaged by the earthquake, including its institutional structures."
"I therefore feel it is wise to stress one essential aspect: the recovery, the reconstruction of the Haitian state, must be the work of the Haitians themselves."
"It is their development that we are talking about."
"We can help them in a spirit of partnership."
"Europe would do well to confirm this in the international conferences planned on this subject."
"Yes to partnership, no to paternalism and neo-colonialism!"
"(CS) All of us will certainly agree that this is one of the greatest disasters in that region in the last 200 years."
"And speaking on behalf of my colleagues in the European Conservatives faction, and on behalf of my fellow citizens in the Czech Republic, I would like to express sympathy and compassion for all the victims and those who are suffering."
"Nevertheless, regardless of this tragedy, there are signs that even after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union is still uncoordinated and incapable of prompt action."
"It distantly reminds me of a four-headed dragon."
"We have a President, Prime Minister of the presiding country, President of the Commission, and Commissioner-designate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I personally believe that in this particular case, we have to recognise that the European Union has been caught flat-footed."
"Those who have not been caught napping are the citizens in the individual Member States who have been providing material as well as financial aid day after day."
"(PT) Mr President, we join with the rest of the world in expressing our sympathy and regret at the tragedy that has befallen the people of Haiti, and wish to show them complete solidarity, but we must highlight certain issues that we believe to be crucial."
"We should begin by denouncing anyone or any country that seeks to profit from this catastrophe by returning to neo-colonialism."
"Such an attitude seems to be behind the deployment of thousands of armed North American troops, despite the fact that the majority of the population live in poverty and remain victims of exploitation by multinational companies and the interference of external bodies, particularly the United States."
"This is a time for all the humanitarian aid, cooperation and support for reconstruction that the people of Haiti deserve, through their dignity and courage."
"We should remember that Haiti was the place where 400 000 Africans, enslaved and trafficked by Europeans, revolted against slavery and brought about the first great social revolution on the American continent."
"Coordinated aid should be sent as a matter of urgency, but it should be done without giving in to neo-colonialist temptations."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an enormous tragedy is taking place in Haiti, caused by nature, but also by the lack of a State worthy of the name, unable to manage even to a minimal extent the disaster and the humanitarian emergency, unable to manage aid for the civilian population which is now prey to unscrupulous people."
"The Red Cross has issued a warning call."
"At the Montreal conference to be held on 25 January, the EU must speak with one voice and request single, coordinated management of the humanitarian action; otherwise, we risk chaos and the aid going to waste, including these enormous and valuable amounts mentioned today by the Commission, and the aid from the Member States."
"Baroness Ashton, an exceptional effort should be made for the children, above all the orphans, who deserve priority assistance, including in terms of psychological support; otherwise, they will be condemned to poverty and exploitation."
"We should also ensure that the international community is not merely prepared to simplify adoption procedures."
"That would lead only to a form of legalised deportation of children, which is not what Haiti needs."
"Mr Frattini, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, is right to propose constructing buildings and care homes so that they can grow up with dignity in their own country and facilitating temporary trips abroad for holidays and, chiefly, for education."
"I will finish with a question: are we prepared, internationally, to reduce or cancel Haiti's debt?"
"(RO) The whole world is indeed at this moment showing solidarity and compassion to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti, highlighting once again the need to act promptly and in a coordinated manner in such situations."
"Loss limitation now depends on how effective intervention is and, as has already been mentioned here, the way in which international agencies and organisations, along with the EU's Department for Humanitarian Aid, have acted is exemplary, not forgetting the individual gestures by Member States."
"I believe that a European Union rapid intervention operational force must be created because the situation in Haiti demonstrates to us the need to maintain public order and ensure the population's safety, in addition to the assistance required by the survivors."
"We are certainly in a situation at the moment where many voices are protesting and making accusations that the alleged intention is to carry out a military occupation under the guise of humanitarian assistance."
"However, in a situation where UN forces are insufficient or have been overtaken by events, the European Union should take further involvement, especially as it enjoys a large amount of credibility in the region."
"I believe that, as a European Union, we must face up to a wide-ranging process of reconstruction in Haiti, while, at the same time, boosting the stability of the state's structures."
"It is, of course, very important to show compassion to the country's inhabitants going through this difficult ordeal, which includes finding specific solutions to facilitate the procedures for adopting children who have been left orphaned after this disaster and offering concrete assistance to the population which has been so sorely tried."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, we are listening to voices from different parts of the House, but they have one matter, one theme, in common: the reaction of the European Union, the political reaction, was not sufficient, and it was not coordinated well."
"I think we should thank the charities that they so spontaneously and, as always, without fail, took responsibility for the need."
"In addition, we should think about what could be done better."
"In fact, I have just one question for Mrs Ashton: this is the first such situation you have been faced with in your new position."
"What is your main conclusion from this event, and from the mistakes which we are all talking about here? More importantly, what can be changed in future?"
"I think this is the most important thing we should think about, and it is, to a great extent, our role to do so."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, that is enough!"
"That is enough."
"It is the same with every disaster, the French send a plane and assistance, the Belgians, the Italians, the Germans, everyone does the same thing, and every time they do it alone; it is the same story every time."
"On the ground, the result is always the same: there is no coordination, missed opportunities for the victims and a lack of organisation."
"When is this going to end?"
"When is the Commission finally going to act?"
"Do not come and tell us that this is complicated, because the projects are ready."
"We just need to use them."
"In 2006, Mr Barnier proposed the creation of a European civil protection force, with Member States contributing on a voluntary basis, without having to wait for hypothetical unanimity from the 27, by pooling existing national civil protection units, by training them together with joint rescue techniques, joint communication methods and a joint headquarters."
"It is easy, Mrs Ashton: do this with those who want to do it!"
"As for the others, they will join us when they realise that this is the future."
"Commitments were entered into after the tsunami and yet, today, nothing has been done."
"I do not say this lightly; the Commission's inaction is criminal."
"Mrs Ashton, why is Europe doomed to repeat its mistakes?"
"Mrs Ashton, no one questions your goodwill, but announce here, today, the creation of this European coordination force."
"Parliament will follow you."
"If you need support, we are there to help you."
"But for pity's sake, stop talking to us about coordination; make this coordination happen!"
"Do not wait for the next disaster!"
"Mr President, I have to say there are people who do, and there are people who talk."
"I therefore want to congratulate the Council, the Commission and the High Representative on the action that they have taken."
"None of this was foreseeable."
"We are looking at something that was unimaginable."
"I have sat here and listened to cheap political points being made against the High Representative, against the Member States and against the Commission via the notion that somehow, because it is an American hand rescuing someone from the rubble and saving a life, that you should brush that hand away and say 'no neo-colonialism' and that somehow, by attacking Haiti itself, you make the lives of the people who are suffering there better."
"Shame on you."
"Let us make sure that we coordinate."
"Give the coordination over to the Americans - if it saves lives, it saves lives."
"Forget the political rhetoric."
"Congratulations on committing this amount of money."
"Congratulations, Baroness Ashton, on not playing to the audience and using up air space to get into Haiti just to go there and show that you are there."
"What does that do?"
"It does absolutely nothing."
"Therefore, angry on behalf of those people who want rescuing, let us coordinate with the Americans."
"Let us kick the butt of the United Nations so that it delivers aid, and let us stop making cheap political points."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to add my voice to that of Mr Juvin - the humanitarian aid is poorly coordinated."
"I do not want to talk only about humanitarian aid, but about what is called technical, structural or development aid."
"The catastrophe was not foreseeable, but we did know what a terrible state Haiti is in, and to make matters worse, it has been struck by this misfortune."
"We have known for a long time what a bad condition Haiti is in, and how badly its structures function."
"We know, too, that if they had been functioning better, and if, before the earthquake, we had organised aid and technical cooperation with Haiti in a better way, those structures would have been working better and, as a result, it would have enabled better use of our aid now and would have saved many thousands of people - but that did not happen."
"Does Mrs Ashton, as High Representative and a Member of the Council, intend to take specific action, with specific dates, to coordinate the technical cooperation of various European countries so that the third countries to which we give aid really use that aid well?"
"Are we going to use any kind of exchange of best practices between countries which have a lot of experience, where technical cooperation functions very well, and countries which are only beginning to use that technical cooperation?"
"Will a good, common, strong European policy come into being, which third countries will really make use of, so that we will not give humanitarian aid in the dark and in haste when, unexpectedly, hundreds of thousands of people find themselves in a tragic situation?"
"(IT) Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the enormous tragedy that has struck Haiti requires an immediate response and many aid and rescue activities are under way, carried out by individual Member States, even if there is a good deal of competition between European countries."
"The new Europe with its High Representative ought to be capable of providing its own aid to the people who are suffering."
"The earthquake, moreover, has struck the poorest country in the western hemisphere, where 80% of the population live below the poverty line and 54% live in absolute poverty."
"Within this emergency, however, there is another: the emergency involving the children, the weakest sector of the population, who have been left with no family, no protection and no State."
"I would therefore like to call upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to examine actions intended to allow Haitian children up to the age of 10 to be taken in and looked after by European countries."
"Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions;"
"I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country."
"All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children."
"We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti."
"Mr President, in recent days, there have been a number of complaints about the ineffectiveness and slowness of the response to the Haitian crisis."
"Many point to the increasing insecurity, the growing despair among those who survived the quake, and the appalling lack of food and clothing."
"It is true that these problems exist and we need to solve them as soon as possible."
"However, we should applaud the engagement of various international actors, ranging from governments to civil society organisations and to individuals worldwide."
"The European Union is certainly among those who have expressed their wholehearted solidarity with the Haitian people."
"Again, many have criticised the supposedly slow reaction of the EU to the crisis even today, but the EU is not only about decisions made in Brussels."
"National governments have already sent thousands of men and women to help the Haitians and have allocated millions of euros in aid."
"The role of the EU should be concentrated more on medium- and long-term aid and aimed at the reconstruction of Haitian towns and villages, of their infrastructure, schools and hospitals."
"The EU can certainly be the forum, the umbrella under which Europe's medium- and long-term aid can be distributed and coordinated."
"The pledge recently made by the Commission and the Member States to earmark almost EUR 500 million is certainly a big and significant step in this direction, and we should all stand behind it."
"(ES) Firstly, I would like to extend my condolences and solidarity to the people of Haiti, who have been so hard hit by this catastrophe."
"We in the European Union are not a military power, and neither do we wish to be one."
"Yet we are a force in the world due to our social model."
"We are also a power to be reckoned with for our development cooperation and humanitarian assistance, and we are proud of that."
"Today, Haiti, or at least the catastrophe that has hit this country, poses a challenge to the new institutions created by the Lisbon Treaty."
"Now is the time for humanitarian aid, but very soon the time will come to rebuild, promote development and offer assistance to governability and institutionality."
"And we must respond to the expectations of the people of Haiti with one voice."
"We must respond by combining the functions of the High Representative with the functions of the Commissioners for Development and Humanitarian Aid."
"Why? Why should we all act together?"
"To coordinate the aid from countries more effectively, to ensure our aid is more efficient, to speak with a European voice that is identifiable in the world and to live up to the world's expectations of us at such times: to support this humanitarian crisis and promote development."
"Mr President, one of the poorest countries in the world ravaged in just 15 seconds, the victim of bad government, the victim of dictatorship and corruption."
"Fifty thousand people dead, thousands still missing and three million homeless."
"The United States' response has been commendable, the United Nations' slightly less so, but I have to agree with everything that has been said."
"We are not being political in this, Mr Cashman: our response has been less than adequate."
"We have been left in the slipstream of the United States."
"The logistical difficulties will be overcome - clean water, medication, food and shelter - these will all happen in due course."
"But what Haiti needs to emerge from this disaster is a fully functioning democracy with an economy that can sustain its people."
"Its recovery must be measured over the years, and not just in the weeks and the months after this crisis."
"As has been said time and time again, it will disappear from the television sets."
"It will go from item one over the next two or three weeks to item three, and then it will be gone."
"But that is where the real challenge is, because in 2008, Haiti was hit by two devastating hurricanes."
"Poverty and desolation were left in their wake."
"The world leaders at that stage promised EUR 600 million."
"Only EUR 40 million was actually delivered."
"What we need is the rebirth, the resurgence, the re-emergence and the redevelopment of Haiti."
"It must be led and it must be managed in a proper fashion but, above all else, it must set down a clear and deliverable strategy to make Haiti the proud, independent and democratic entity that it should be, but which it is not and has not been up to now, thus leading to the present catastrophe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community, using all the tools at its disposal."
"As far as financial resources are concerned, significant progress has been made in recent days and hours."
"What deserves more thought is the other aspects of Europe's response to the crisis, but we should avoid worrying about our image and concentrate instead on the substance, as the High Representative rightly said."
"The central role of the MINUSTAH mission has now emerged clearly, in terms of both civil protection and security, ruling out an autonomous CSDP mission, but the EU's coordination role in support of the UN mission remains key."
"On this point, I would like to remind Mr Juvin that this coordination exists, and that the Monitoring and Information Centre is performing it in the area of civil protection, and the Situation Centre is performing it in the area of security, and it is to be hoped that this work will result in deployment of the European Gendarmerie Force, as has been expressly requested by the United Nations."
"What it is useful to understand from the High Representative and from the Commission is how the MIC and the Situation Centre are responding, in practice, in the face of such onerous tasks and tests, how their coordination is working, and whether their instruments and resources are adequate."
"This will also help us at a later date when we will have to consider the adequacy of these instruments and the capacity of consular protection, but now is not the time for these debates."
"Now is the time for action and commitment, and we fully support the action being taken by the High Representative."
"(SL) I, too, would like to express my sympathy for the events in Haiti, as well as congratulate the European Commission and European institutions for their relatively appropriate response."
"Nevertheless, like some of my fellow Members, I, too, wonder whether our response has been rapid enough."
"It might perhaps be a good idea if Mrs Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission, personally visited the scene of the tragic event, as that could prove important for several reasons."
"I disagree with those of you who argue that the presence of soldiers and other law enforcement personnel might herald the beginning of a colonial approach on our part towards Haiti."
"In my opinion, such talk is neither fair nor appropriate."
"What is important, however, is that, at the next International conference on Haiti, we adopt long-term measures for the re-establishment of state institutions, to enable them to work again."
"Here I refer, in particular, to health and education policies."
"Only policies of this kind, and only development in these areas and institutions, can shape Haiti into a more stable country than it has been to date."
"(ES) Mr President, I wish to emphasise the importance of the European Union providing leadership: not merely immediate emergency humanitarian aid but also long-term cooperation for rebuilding the country."
"We must work with the local authorities and with the government of Haiti, as the country is already fragile enough without us making it even weaker by having the international organisations stand in for its authorities."
"We must also work alongside local non-governmental organisations."
"I would like to acknowledge the fast response of the Spanish Presidency, both in terms of coordinating aid and making available to the European Union the aid resources Spain already had in the country and the region, since it is the foremost European aid donor, not only in Latin America but also specifically in Haiti."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, politics is, first and foremost, about symbols, and that is why I think you should not be here, but in Haiti; that is why I think you should not be travelling to the United States, but to Haiti."
"I feel - and I say this with a great deal of sadness - that you have not gauged the magnitude of the event, of this terrible tragedy, and, deep down, when we consider all this, Europe has never been so absent."
"We are the biggest donors, and yet we do not exist."
"My second feeling is that the more we nominate, the more we create functions and titles, the less we exist, and this should prompt us to ask ourselves some questions."
"How many disasters must there be before the leaders of the European Union finally measure up to their responsibilities?"
"Mr Barnier's report has been on the table since 2006."
"What are we waiting for to adopt it?"
"What are we waiting for to apply it?"
"Mr President, I think all our thoughts have been expressed and they have to go out to those who have lost their lives: the people of the United Nations, the people of Haiti itself and the people who are suffering although they are still alive."
"What we need is a good, strong coordinated effort and nothing - but nothing - should get in the way of that."
"Can I say that I welcome the commitment that we have made in Europe to the people of Haiti."
"I hope we follow that through because I was touched - and it is quite right - what happens in two weeks' time when they cease to be part of the media and they cease to be part of the news?"
"What are these people going to do then?"
"Yes, there is a clear need to rebuild Haiti, both in the short and long term, but most important now is to get the aid distributed to the suffering people on the ground, the people who are hurting."
"I have to say that I agree totally with the comments of Mr Cashman earlier on."
"This is too important to score cheap political points."
"(ES) Please allow me a few seconds to begin by congratulating the High Representative, the Council, the Commission and the rotating Presidency of the European Union for the speed, coordination and effort they have shown from the outset."
"Perhaps they did not enjoy the great media attention prompted by 10 000 US marines arriving on the island, but everything took place very quickly and effectively in my opinion, and I have plenty of experience."
"I would just like to mention one thing, which has not come up throughout the debate: 50% of the survivors recovered from the rubble during the first 78 hours were saved by teams from Europe and the Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, as Mrs Joly has already said, there are circumstances in which words and figures lose all meaning and become ludicrous: two million refugees - as we have heard - perhaps more, more than 200 000 deaths, a country that has been laid waste, a capital that has been almost erased from the map."
"The urgency now is to dig out the last survivors - if there are any left - to bury the dead, to feed the living, to distribute water, to treat, to operate and to rebuild."
"Every country departed quickly, very quickly, with its resources, its equipment, its dogs, its people and its generosity."
"It is an immense, magnificent effort, but it is a national effort."
"Europe absolutely must now gather momentum and give substance to this idea that some of us, many of us, have been defending here in the European Parliament and elsewhere for several years, namely the implementation of a European civil intervention body, green helmets or white helmets - the colour is of little importance - people, resources and common strategies."
"EU-FAST, the initiative launched by Mr Verhofstadt in 2003, or EuropeAid, launched by Mr Barnier in 2006 - the paternity ultimately does not matter - the idea is to be able to act quickly, to be ready together."
"(FI) Mr President, I find it odd that people here have spoken of visibility and have doubted the motives of the United States of America, because right now help is needed."
"I think that it is especially tragic that among the ruins at the moment, there are people who could still be rescued."
"Everything that can be done to improve the situation should be done."
"When, a while ago, the crisis management forces were established to bolster the European's foreign and security policy, including its defence policy, the reason I was given for this, at least in Finland, was that these forces were also there in the event of natural disasters, and that they could help when such catastrophes struck anywhere in the world, including Europe of course."
"Now, however, crisis management forces actually have nothing to do in the different parts of Europe in which they are stationed."
"They have nothing to do."
"Fortunately, there are no crises in Europe, and so they have nothing to do."
"What is stopping these crisis management forces from being used for crises like this if help is being requested?"
"(LT) Today, after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are probably dealing with the biggest tragedy that has ever taken place and we need to understand the position of the High Representative when, at the very beginning of their term, they have to solve a rather complicated task which, I would even say, they have never had to deal with before."
"Yes, it is true, today we see some shortcomings and in future, we need better prepared European Union joint forces, who could take part in rescue operations."
"I think that the greatest contribution today would be for that money that was mentioned today to be sent to the Republic of Haiti, to be put to use as soon as possible and spent on the rebuilding of infrastructure, as the President of Haiti mentioned, and it can perhaps be put towards removing some of those collapsed homes that are lying in the streets today."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as I began, I wanted to come to this House to hear the views."
"I take on board and understand the frustration that honourable Members feel, that there are issues which could be handled better."
"Members asked questions about visibility and coordination."
"There is no question that, because America is closer, because it has the capacity to mobilise as quickly as it did, then the pictures you will see on your television screens will be of them."
"The fact that we worked so closely and collaboratively with the United States is also an important part of what we do now and in the future."
"And there is also no question that, as I was woken in the night to be told of the earthquake, we mobilised our people as quickly as we possibly could."
"Twenty-one Member States were mobilised to respond."
"We had work done, with the Council and Commission side coming together for the very first time, and may I just say, it is only eight days since I was before you in my hearing here."
"Twenty-one Member States with 11 search-and-rescue teams, five field hospitals, six advance medical posts, 40 medical teams, six water-purification units; we despatched these as quickly as we could and I pay tribute to the Member States for the work they do."
"I also pay tribute to the officials who worked and have continued to work day and night to pull this effort together."
"I put the question very early to the United Nations on the ground, and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, where best my efforts could be."
"There was no doubt that I had nothing to contribute on the ground other than to take up valuable space when planes were circling the airfield unable to land because of the state of the airfield at the present time."
"I am not a doctor. I am not a fire-fighter."
"My place was to bring together the coordination, to be talking to the Friends of Haiti Group, to be coordinating with the United States to make sure that we put in the maximum effort on the ground."
"I also pay tribute, as honourable Members have done, to the NGOs and to the people on the ground."
"The devastation that happened on the ground had enormous impact on the United Nations, which has lost many members of their senior staff, and on NGOs, which have been unable to respond as quickly as they would simply because people of theirs have died."
"That has made it very difficult, as you have watched and we have watched people desperate for help, wondering where the help is."
"Getting the help out in these circumstances has been incredibly difficult, and again people have worked tirelessly to provide it."
"Now things are getting easier, the help is getting out, but do not underestimate for one moment how difficult the circumstances have been on the ground."
"Did it work well?"
"Yes."
"Am I satisfied?"
"No."
"As I start my first weeks in this job, I say to you very clearly: I hear what you say."
"I hear the frustration."
"I understand it."
"And you are right to criticise me that it is not as good as it can be in the future."
"You are right."
"It should, and must, get better and better."
"What I have to do is take what happened and learn the lessons of it now in order to make sure that we do more in the future to pull together, but I take nothing away from the tremendous work that was done and is being done hour by hour and day by day."
"For the long term, honourable Members are absolutely right."
"When the cameras have gone, we need to be there."
"We need to be there physically, we need to be there in terms of the support we can give."
"I agree that debt issues need to be a part of the discussions that take place."
"I agree that what is done must be done in partnership with the Haitian people with due respect for them."
"I agree on the importance of rebuilding the infrastructure, and I agree that we have to ensure that the role of the United Nations is recognised and make sure that they are able to fulfil it well."
"That is why I am going not only to the United States to see Secretary of State Clinton but also to the United Nations to talk with the Secretary-General and the key people about what we can now do to pull together for the future because that, as you say, will be of enormous importance."
"Let me finish on the reality of the situation."
"As honourable Members have said, this is a country where over 70% of people were already living below the poverty line."
"It is very important, as honourable Members have said, that the children, the orphan children especially, are cared for properly, and the devastation will require support in the years ahead."
"Let me just tell you a little bit about the infrastructure at the moment."
"Hospitals, electricity, communications, water supply, seaports and airports have been badly damaged."
"The main official buildings, the Presidential Palace, the Parliament, Ministries of Treasury, Justice, Planning, Health and Interior are completely destroyed."
"Many of the high government officials are missing."
"The capacities of the Haitian Government are not functioning."
"It is, as you said, already one of the poorest countries in the world, and because we need to rebuild that infrastructure, I share your commitment to make sure that we do."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to tell Mr Le Hyaric, who is calling for food surpluses to be shipped to Haiti, that this is not the European Union's approach, for the simple reason that the Commission prefers to purchase these products in the region."
"We will begin by seeing whether we can purchase them in the region rather than transport our surpluses to Haiti."
"Secondly, concerning the whole matter of coordination and civil protection and so on, let me just say three things."
"First, civil protection is a competence of the Member States, and all coordination initiatives must be built on this basis."
"This was also proposed by the Barnier report but, up to now, we have not reached a conclusion."
"It is a competence of the Member States and not of the Commission as such."
"Secondly, as far as civil protection and its coordination is concerned, since the 2004 tsunami, EU civil protection coordination has grown stronger and much more efficient."
"Virtual exercises can, of course, never test enough the effectiveness of our cooperation as much as natural disasters do, sadly enough."
"In this crisis, non-EU Member States are calling the MIC to see how they can contribute to the relief effort with EU facilities."
"Thirdly, let us not forget that, in the second Barroso Commission, humanitarian relief and civil protection have been combined under one Commissioner, which is, I think, a very valuable effort."
"In addition we also now have a High Representative, who will have a double hat."
"What we have seen in the past about coordination is that it is not lacking inside the Commission for example - I will come back to that in a minute - but it is sometimes between the European institutions and the Member States and between the European Commission and Council."
"The whole idea behind this double-hatting was precisely that the Council and Commission could work better together, and I think it has been demonstrated in this crisis that this has, in fact, been quite an advance."
"Lastly, I would also like to say that I am a little bit sad about what some speakers have said."
"Of course as a Commissioner, I cannot be sad, I just have to take notice of it, but it does not pay enough tribute to all our people who have been working, on the spot and in Brussels, from hour one, day and night, during the weekend, without any complaint, without asking for any compensation."
"They have been working very hard and within hours they were also active on the spot, although their facilities were also hit hard."
"So please consider that this is the kind of massive disaster that is not foreseeable, that you can only respond to when it occurs, and for which you have to demonstrate that you can organise a response in a very short period of time."
"I think the Commission has been demonstrating this."
"I think that the Member States immediately and massively supported our action and I think we should also be a little bit less critical about those services."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the February part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to express my solidarity with the people of Haiti affected by the earthquake that hit the country on 12 January, and I welcome the aid commitments made by the EU."
"The European Union is the world's largest provider of humanitarian and development aid."
"A few hours after the catastrophe, the EU provided EUR 3 million of aid for the initial relief operations."
"A sum of EUR 134 million was released for early rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts."
"EUR 200 million has been set aside for rehabilitation in the longer term, adding to the EUR 92 million that has been given by different EU countries."
"These amounts, totalling EUR 429 million, may be further increased, depending on the needs assessment."
"I would like to congratulate the European Commission on their coordination of the aid, but I am disappointed that the European Union has not been visible enough on the ground."
"This is detrimental to the image of the EU in international public opinion, and is in contrast with the image of the US, which contributed EUR 91.6 million."
"During this crisis, there has been a clear need for medical care, so I am calling for an increase in the quota of doctors and health technicians, along with greater logistical support."
"I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti."
"In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable."
"It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough."
"In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund?"
"Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response."
"I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective."
"The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines."
"He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force."
"What will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the reports reaching us from Haiti are shocking."
"It is one of the most horrifying catastrophes we have heard of."
"However, we can already draw certain conclusions which may be useful in future."
"It can be clearly seen that the mechanisms which coordinate humanitarian aid are not the best."
"Aid for the Haitians could have been more effective if the donors of humanitarian aid had been able to use better means of coordinating their work."
"Improving cooperation is not a matter just for the European Union, because progress in this area requires constructive analysis and action on the part of all substantial donors."
"In situations such as the one in Haiti today, what is important is speed, adequacy and elasticity."
"Today is not the right time to deliberate, for example, about who should control the airport in the capital of Haiti."
"That is, of course, important, but decisions on the use of specific solutions should be made at another time."
"Now, we must do everything possible to concentrate on the most important objective - saving human lives."
"in writing. - The recent earthquake in Haiti demonstrates to us all how fragile living on this earth can be."
"We have all been moved by the pictures and stories coming from the media in recent days."
"The response of the global community to this natural disaster has been amazing and I commend all of those who are helping with the relief effort or funding the relief effort from home."
"It will take generations for the people of Haiti to fully recover from what will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event."
"It is important that this House shows solidarity to those people."
"It would be my hope that the European Union could play a leading role in giving those people hope of a better future."
"Emergency aid in the short term must be backed up with longer-term aid to help the future generations recover from this most horrific ordeal."
"The way Members of this House, across all political groups, have responded to date has been extremely heartening."
"I look forward to working with my colleagues to do what I can for the people of Haiti."
"The EU must aim to be an example of the well off always willing to give a hand-up to those less advantaged then ourselves."
"Mr President, tragic information about the disastrous earthquake in Haiti reaches us every day."
"From this news, it is absolutely clear that Haiti, plunged into total chaos and left without support, is not coping with the effects of that terrible tragedy."
"The entire international community, including the European Union, is obliged to give humanitarian aid to the victims of this disaster, who are completely bereft of basic necessities."
"Therefore, I would like to appeal strongly for the appropriate European Union structures to take immediate and effective action in order to send, as quickly as possible, essential aid and support for the fight with the results of the earthquake in Haiti."
"Situation in Iran (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Iran."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, this is an important opportunity to raise the situation in Iran."
"The European Union wants normal relations with Iran, and our efforts on the nuclear issue are part of that."
"In this context, I will continue, in my capacity as High Representative, the role of my predecessor, Javier Solana, in the international talks with Iran."
"Iran is an important country with a deep history and rich culture, and a remarkably talented population."
"The films and books coming out of Iran are impressive, the level of education of women is high, there is a capacity for public debate and the young population is vibrant and active."
"In many ways, Iranian society has the hallmarks and the capacity of a free society."
"The threat to the society has been reflected in the turmoil that followed what many in Iran saw as a fraudulent election last year."
"That, of course, is a matter for the Iranians."
"Our concern is that international norms and standards on civil and political rights must be respected."
"In this respect, I am deeply concerned over the reports of violent suppression of demonstrations and arbitrary detentions in Tehran and other Iranian cities during the recent Ashura commemorations at the end of December."
"The use of violence against demonstrators seeking to exercise their freedom of expression and rights of assembly is not acceptable."
"These are universal human rights that must be respected and those detained for peacefully exercising those rights should be released."
"I also note with deep concern that many arrests seem to have targeted human rights defenders and journalists, and that many detained are denied access to legal representation and contact with their families."
"Iran must live up to its international obligations and treat detained persons in accordance with international human rights standards."
"Another recent issue is the detention of another 12 members of the Baha'i religious community."
"These people must be assured a just, open and fair trial in accordance with international standards."
"The EU has spared no opportunity to ask the Iranian Government to respect those international obligations which they freely and voluntarily adhered to."
"We issue public statements and use other diplomatic means."
"We work through the United Nations: the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month."
"We will make full use of the upcoming review of Iran which will be held at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in early February."
"On the nuclear issue, we regret that Tehran has not followed up on the last meeting between Javier Solana and Jalili, the chief negotiator, on 1 October in Geneva."
"We all assessed that the meeting was positive."
"But, in effect, Iran has now rejected a draft agreement proposed by the IAEA and has been refusing to pursue talks on the nuclear issue."
"The EU and its negotiating partners are all committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, and to that end, we must continue to implement the dual-track approach."
"We need a serious engagement in meaningful talks from Tehran's side."
"Our objective remains to build confidence that the nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes."
"The confidence deficit was further increased by the revelation that Iran has been building another enrichment facility without informing the IAEA in due time."
"In addition, Iran continues not to cooperate fully with the IAEA and not to respect its international obligations."
"It is vital that the EU and the international community stand united behind the negotiating effort, including by supporting that effort through appropriate measures."
"The widest possible unity is key if we are to achieve our objective."
"If Iran sets out on a more constructive course on the nuclear issue and on regional stability in general, it could play an important role in the Middle East and Gulf region, which would reflect its rightful place and proud history."
"In conclusion, the challenges posed by Iran weigh very heavy in my portfolio."
"This is a country which has enormous potential - and our readiness to engage with Iran constructively has been made over and over."
"I shall continue to make that case."
"I sincerely hope that, during the time of my mandate, I will return to this House with a more positive picture of relations with Iran."
"Baroness Ashton, you are quite right to be concerned, because the situation in Afghanistan is extremely severe, particularly from the viewpoint of human rights."
"I refer particularly to civil rights and political freedoms, where we are seeing a truly incredible breakdown: the arbitrary exercise of violence, mass imprisonment of opposition members, murders, executions, non-governmental organisations prevented from doing their work, and the impossibility of exercising press freedom."
"A European Parliament delegation was even banned from entering."
"Mr President, in view of the present circumstances, I wonder whether it is worth visiting the country at this time."
"Your remarks on the nuclear front, Baroness Ashton, were very clear and also very forthright: Iran continues to produce enriched uranium despite warnings from the international community."
"It rejected the outstretched hand proffered to it by President Obama and rejected the latest plan suggested by the Six, which involved Russia and France."
"My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: Do you believe that we have exhausted our patience with this country yet?"
"Do you think we should now move on to adopt more hard-hitting measures or do you instead consider that a softly-softly approach is the best way of negotiating with the Iranian regime?"
"I should like to tell you that I sincerely welcome your statement in favour of defending human rights in that country."
"The breaches are extremely severe and I believe, Mr President, that Parliament must condemn the human rights situation in the country without pulling its punches."
"I hope that it will be able to do this by approving the resolution on this topic."
"It must continue to hold firm, very firm, in its tireless defence of freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the developments in the situation in Iran, one cannot help but express serious concern."
"These concerns relate to the increasing infringements of political and civil rights, which we strongly condemn, and concern over the failure to perform the duties resulting from Iran's membership of the Non-Proliferation Agreement, upon which even the country itself states it does not want to cast any doubt."
"We do not question Iran's right to the peaceful development of nuclear energy, nor do we intend to underestimate the important role that Iran can play on a regional level, its legitimate security requirements, or the need to create a credible system of regional security that involves all the nuclear powers in the area."
"It is precisely because of this, though, that we do not understand the reasons for the failure to comply with the request by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the uranium to be enriched abroad, and we regret this decision."
"Faced with this situation, it falls to the Security Council to determine the international community's response and the possibility of new sanctions, which should be focused on non-proliferation and designed to be an instrument to support the path of difficult but unavoidable dialogue, and not designed and used to beat down the regime."
"With regard to this course of action, the European Union should play its part by giving thought, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate form, to possible technical measures to complement the UN sanctions and, at the same time, by confirming its readiness for debate and dialogue, which should never be lost, even at difficult times."
"We will fully support action by the European Union and the High Representative in line with the approach that was set out clearly in the High Representative's speech."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, last summer, I got elected to the European Parliament by voicing criticism against my own government."
"A young woman in Iran, having done the same, would have likely been killed, imprisoned, tortured and raped since."
"Thanks to new media, we have all seen the clips of the brutal way the Iranian regime cracks down on citizens who speak out peacefully for democracy and freedom."
"Recent arrests of human rights reporters by the intelligence office of the Revolutionary Guard show that the Iranian regime takes an increased interest in closing off the country."
"Their reports were heavily relied upon by international journalists."
"Yesterday was Martin Luther King Day."
"We commemorate a man who, too, marched the streets peacefully and said: 'a time comes when silence is betrayal'."
"High Representative, this time has long arrived."
"President Barack Obama broke off his holidays over Christmas to speak out against yet more brutal attacks on citizens after Ashura."
"In the proposed two-track approach to Iran, balancing the nuclear question and human rights, the United States is increasingly emphasising human rights."
"Europe should take a stronger leadership position here, not only when it is politically safe to do so."
"The disaster in Haiti is a terrible tragedy, and I am glad you are taking action."
"However, the man-made disaster that is ongoing in Iran has not been met with leadership and coordination from the European side thus far."
"Last month, a delegation of this Parliament was supposed to visit Iran, but the regime did not want us to see with our own eyes its own weakness and division."
"It is high time that Europe takes one stance regarding Iran, and the world is waiting."
"Is Iran's current regime, which has lost its legitimacy and is divided internally, a credible actor in negotiations?"
"What measures do you propose in the nuclear question that will target the government without harming the population?"
"Are you willing to call an emergency talk in Europe on Iran?"
"To ensure that human rights will remain Europe's priority, how will you use the EU instrument for human rights?"
"I believe we need to support citizens, civil society and journalists."
"The 'Shelter City' programme, proposed by the Czech Presidency, might be a useful tool to support Iranians under threat in Europe."
"In the hearings with Commissioner Kroes, I asked her whether she is willing to work with you to make free speech on the Internet an integrated part of Europe's foreign policy."
"I ask you the same."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the European Parliament has paid close attention to the internal and foreign policy developments in Iran."
"The Iran delegation has been engaged in dialogue with representatives of the government and of civil society and had made preparations for a delegation trip to Iran at the start of the month, although, unfortunately, this was cancelled at short notice."
"The very dissatisfaction with the fraudulent elections and the constant increase in state repression and violence had caused the representatives of Iranian civil society to turn to the European Parliament."
"In their courageous move, they are seeking our support for the upholding of democratic freedoms and they are calling on us to take our own fundamental values seriously."
"The protests are many and they are still going on."
"The Iranian Government is being called on to give political answers to these unsolved questions, yet instead, we see an increase in the worst violations of human rights, such as torture and the assault of detainees, and we hear of the deaths of demonstrators, while unfair trials take place."
"Many Iranians expect us to not only keep an eye on foreign policy and the nuclear programme, but also to see and to take action on the political situation within Iran."
"It is to be welcomed that countries such as Spain and Ireland are prepared to issue visas in an unbureaucratic way to the persecuted defenders of human rights, thus helping them out of acute danger."
"Other Member States should follow this example, and we also ask the Commission to provide rapid help to the politically persecuted."
"From the outside, what we can do is limited."
"The crucial changes must come from within the country itself."
"We must, however, keep the communication channels to the outside world open."
"In that context, we must be highly critical of foreign companies such as Siemens and Nokia, whose technology is helping to make censorship possible and even more effective."
"As no agreement has been reached in the negotiations on the nuclear issue, there is more and more talk of imposing sanctions."
"It is not clear, however, what sanctions would have the desired influence on the political leadership."
"If the sanctions lead to a worsening of living standards for many people, an example being sanctions on petrol, they will not achieve their objective and will give the regime the opportunity to blame what it would call the hostile outside world for the deteriorating economic situation."
"It is, therefore, very important to develop targeted and intelligent sanctions, including against individuals."
"Thus, for example, the Council can blacklist individuals responsible for the repressive measures of recent months."
"In the EU's policy on Iran, what is crucial is that we create, and stick to, a dual-track policy."
"Despite the rebuffs, we need to seek political dialogue."
"Isolating Iran would help neither its people nor its neighbours in the region."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, President Ahmadinejad's ruthless ambition to develop nuclear weapons represents, in my view, the gravest threat to world peace today."
"Only through a united and coordinated approach will the EU's diplomacy eventually succeed."
"Renewed sanctions must now be targeted and must be extremely damaging to the regime in Tehran."
"But, equally, we should recognise that Iran's people and the Iranian regime are not the same thing."
"Since Ahmadinejad stole the presidential election last year, we have seen many dissidents and brave young protestors take to the streets."
"These people need our support because they identify with our values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law."
"Indeed, such is the desperation in Iran that opposition leader Mir Hossain Musavi, hardly known to be a democrat in the past, has said he is prepared to sacrifice his own life for the future good of his own country."
"Meanwhile, outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely."
"We MEPs in this House long to see a democratic and free Iran, which no longer exports terrorism via Hamas and Hezbollah, and takes its rightful place in the international community."
"The EU should redouble its efforts to expedite that process in every way possible."
"Mr President, the media presented me with an awkward proposition last week: Israel, they say, is going to attack its arch-enemy Iran sooner or later."
"While this debate was going on in Europe, the media in Iran was also intensively discussing the military option against Tehran's controversial nuclear project."
"All Zionist lies and exaggerations, was the conservative newspaper Kayhan's verdict on the purported nuclear threat."
"Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme represents a serious security threat - for Israel, first and foremost, but for the wider region, too."
"I still hope, therefore, that the international community will no longer just recognise this, but will actually take action in this regard."
"In my view, all options must be on the table in this connection."
"An effective sanctions regime, which the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, was still calling for yesterday, will mean, at all events, that the Jewish state will absolutely not have to take unilateral action."
"That brings me to a crucial question for the Council, for you, High Representative."
"Is there, in fact, a European basis for the rigorous tightening-up of the sanctions against the Iranian regime?"
"Close commercial links between a number of prominent EU Member States - I need not name any names as you, too, must be aware of who they are - and the Islamic Republic could always pose major obstacles to seriously tackling the nuclear issue."
"Over recent weeks, the newspaper The Wall Street Journal has written a number of cutting opinion pieces about this that practically constituted charge sheets against Europe."
"In brief, Baroness Ashton, is there a basis for tightening up effective sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran?"
"I await your answer."
"(DE) Mr President, the most recent events, in particular, have made clear that the handling of civil liberties in Iran has clear failings, from the European point of view."
"The death sentence handed down to the recently sentenced protesters is a sign of how differently fundamental rights and their observance are handled in that country."
"It is also important to stress, however, that the EU's external policy must not be lopsided, as we often gladly turn a blind eye to such things in the case of economically and geostrategically important partners - such as China or, perhaps, Saudi Arabia - despite the fact that serious deviations from our European ideas of democracy and the rule of law take place in these countries, too."
"As a member of the Iran delegation, it is a particular concern of mine that the delayed trip to Iran be reinstated as soon as possible in order to improve bilateral communications with the EU and, in so doing, possibly also make a contribution, through the dialogue, to defusing the dramatic situation in Iran."
"(PL) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Iran's internal situation is worsening dramatically from day to day and from week to week."
"Human rights are being brutally violated before our eyes, and we are seeing terror of a kind we have not had to deal with for decades."
"An unprecedented wave of state repression is trying to silence those who are fighting for democratic reforms in Iran."
"In the fight against its citizens, the government is also using the specially trained, armed young people of the Basij militia."
"The European Parliament must condemn the government's excessive use of force and increasing breaches of human rights."
"It is also unacceptable to use the death penalty against the opposition, including under the pretext of the crime of 'moharebeh', offending God. Therefore, the European Union needs a new approach to the situation in Iran."
"The European Union's High Representative, Catherine Ashton, should send a strong and clear message to the citizens of Iran, confirming our desire to defend human rights."
"The question of a nuclear weapon is extremely important."
"However, we should not stop defending fundamental values simply to gain a tactical advantage in negotiations."
"In talks with Iran, we must not marginalise the rule of law, freedom of speech or the right to information."
"These values must not be treated as of less significance."
"I come from Poland where, over 20 years ago, in 1989, tyranny gave place to democracy."
"This came about thanks to the non-violent action of the opposition Solidarity movement and peaceful dialogue between the government and the people."
"I do not now see a better way forward for the residents of Iran."
"(PT) The Iranian question is one of the most important issues in modern international politics."
"Everything must be done to prevent the Iranian regime, which has been so detrimental to peace and security in the Middle East, from gaining access to nuclear weapons."
"However, the role of the European Union in its relations with Iran must not be wasted on the nuclear question."
"Since the rigged elections in June, we have witnessed a popular movement against the repressive, obscurantist and anti-democratic nature of the Iranian regime."
"Europe must be consistent in promoting the universal value of human rights, for which many people are risking their lives on the streets of Tehran."
"Without questioning the people's sovereign right to decide their own destiny, it is imperative that the European Union takes steps to encourage those who are fighting for liberty and democracy in Iran."
"There is nothing more effective than free and alternative channels of information for combating censorship, which is the preserve of all oppressive regimes."
"In view of this, we expect the Farsi television channel, awarded to Euronews by the European Commission, to be up and running very soon."
"We also expect that Baroness Ashton, as the new High Representative, will push ahead with creative initiatives that will contribute to greater political transparency in Iran, and taking on board the recommendations made by all those who have been struggling for a free Iran, including exiled Iranians."
"Moreover, this concern with the political future of Iran should guide any new sanctions that are decided upon within the context of the nuclear question."
"As the Iranian intellectual, Akbar Ganji, explained here in Parliament, it is imperative that we avoid economic sanctions that weaken the people, and especially the Iranian middle class, which makes up the rank and file of the opposition."
"Nothing can do more for security in the Middle East, Europe and the world than an Iranian democracy that has been built by Iranians."
"The European Union must make this one of its objectives."
"(FR) Mr President, Iran is undoubtedly going through the most serious crisis in its history since 1979 because of this regime, which is impervious to any kind of change and which has increased the number of targeted assassinations of opponents, of raids and of imprisonments of peaceful demonstrators, as well as journalists, since the electoral farce of 12 June 2009."
"At the start of the debate, Mrs Ashton mentioned the NGO reports, disastrous reports in this regard, without even talking about the parody of justice meted out to the French woman, Clotilde Reiss, and to the Baha'i minority - seven of whom have been on trial in Tehran since last Monday."
"They risk life imprisonment or worse, simply because their religion is different from that of the ruling power."
"The report is harsh, the presidential elections have changed nothing, or rather they have: they have radicalised the Iranian regime even more, if that were possible; there is also radicalisation with regard to the outside world, with the volte-face of the Iranian authorities on the draft nuclear agreement negotiated in October 2009 in Vienna."
"When are we going to consider mentioning - I say mentioning here - intelligent and targeted sanctions, such as those referred to by Mrs Lochbihler; sanctions, therefore, against this regime, which is openly anti-Western and anti-Semitic?"
"I know that this is a narrow window of opportunity, Mrs Ashton, but do you not think that we must do more and do better here, that we must help Iran's young people, who are proclaiming their outrage on the Internet, that we must denounce the recurring calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and, above all, that we must support this civil society and the opposition, this democratic movement which is defying this vote-robbing president and his militias?"
"We must avoid an escalation, I am very conscious of this, but we must also avoid evasion and not repeat the error that we made in Afghanistan where Europe was unable to protect Commander Massoud."
"It is our duty to support the leaders of the Iranian opposition so that they avoid a similar fate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation inside Iran is continuing to deteriorate."
"At least eight people have been killed recently, the regime has stepped up arrests of women - female journalists, trade unionists and intellectuals - 30 mothers who were demanding news of their disappeared children have been arrested, and the grave of the young martyr for freedom, Neda Agha-Soltan, has been repeatedly desecrated by firearms bullets."
"It is clear that the regime intends to increase repression and establish a climate of terror."
"In addition to this domestic situation, Iran demonstrates a lack of international cooperation, refusing the International Atomic Energy Agency access to Iranian sites for uranium enrichment."
"This clearly shows the real intentions of the Iranian atomic programme; if they were solely peaceful, there would be no need to hide them."
"Europe should therefore forcefully voice its concerns because a military, nuclear power could jeopardise the continent's security and have significant political consequences for all the countries in the region."
"(DE) Mr President, even if the conflict in Iran often appears to be a power struggle between the old and the new establishment, it is still very clear to see that this very closed social system has very clear cracks."
"The situation in Iran is certainly proof of the significance of democracy, namely the ability of every single citizen to give expression to his or her political will."
"Those with political responsibility in Iran are currently responding to this legitimate will of society with repression by the State extending as far as the death penalty."
"These assaults on the citizens must be stopped immediately, as State repression will certainly not bring an end to this will of society."
"On the contrary, Iran's long history shows us this."
"On the subject of the planned trip of the European Parliament's delegation to Tehran that was cancelled by the Iranian Government at short notice, I would just like to say that, at this point in time, this trip was really important in order, above all, to lead to talks and dialogues with everyone, including, and in particular, with the local citizens and civil society."
"(FR) Mr President, the Iranians stated that they were ready for a gradual exchange of low-enriched uranium for fuel."
"This kind of production has been rejected by the Group of Six, even though it was not actually all that different from the proposal that this same group had drawn up shortly beforehand."
"I do not at all underestimate the Iranians' negotiating qualities, in particular, with regard to the definition of the gradual nature of the exchange they were proposing, but given the stakes, Mrs Ashton, do you not think that this refusal by the Group of Six could perhaps have been the subject of a precise European Union common position?"
"Why did we not seize this opportunity?"
"I would like you to voice your thoughts on this matter to us."
"I do admit to being very puzzled by Europe's discretion in this debate."
"We have legitimacy, Europe has legitimacy."
"Let us use it to help reach an agreement."
"(ES) My first speech in Parliament, in June last year, was on the subject of Iran, in the wake of the latest wave of executions."
"At that time, I called for the European Union to bring all the instruments at its disposal to bear in order to protect human rights."
"Now we find that the repression is still continuing against the Baha'i religious minority, against homosexuals - and I particularly call for the release of imprisoned homosexuals, who are sentenced to death in some cases - against the opposition - with more than 2 500 of the opposition imprisoned - against press freedom - only this Monday we saw the newspaper Farhang-e-Ashti closed down for publishing a statement by Mr Mousavi, the opposition leader - and against the Kurdish minority."
"Iran remains a great challenge on the European agenda, and not merely because of the nuclear threat: the international community is already taking action against this."
"The challenge is that Iran possesses a great ability to influence practically all the areas where efforts are being made to find a peaceful and diplomatic solution in the Near East, and also in Iraq and in Afghanistan."
"Through its repressive actions, Iran is destroying any opportunity of normalising its foreign relations, so that it can be accepted by the community of nations and play a constructive role in international relations."
"That is the situation we socialists desire, but it can only be achieved if Iran meets its international commitments, beginning with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"According to the terms of this covenant, Iran must recognise political parties, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, the right to association, freedom of expression, etc."
"The support and solidarity of the European Union, which I now call for on behalf of those who demand more rights and for those repressed by the regime, must not be mistaken for any type of Western interference."
"Instead, it represents a wish for Iran to meet the minimum requirements necessary to enable it to negotiate with the rest of the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in European Union publications and on EU websites, we often say that human rights are the heart of the process of European integration and the key element of its external relations."
"The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights."
"Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too."
"With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them."
"When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions."
"In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran."
"I think that this could be a commitment taken on by this Parliament too, remembering that Neda Agha-Soltan was a student with a degree in philosophy, and that this symbol could unite the European Parliament as it calls upon UNESCO to take this action."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent weeks, we have seen the Iranian Government, or the Iranian regime, commit serious violations of human rights and the most basic democratic freedoms."
"So, for this Parliament and for Europe, the issue is no longer simply that of relations with a country which is thinking about a nuclear policy outside the accepted rules and the specific control elements which, as a rule, are laid down by the international community for these matters."
"There is something new, or something old is becoming more acute, relating to an even more worrying issue: human rights."
"I am convinced that Iran could potentially have a much more important role in the region in which it is located."
"However, this fresh wave of infringements of rights must, I believe, constitute a priority for us and for the High Representative."
"The clamp-down by the government has not subdued the voices of democratic dissent."
"Now it is appropriate for the international community to play an active role and to provide assistance to those who oppose the regime and believe that their fundamental rights must be respected."
"We should therefore have a permanent presence there."
"The European Parliament's delegation can, by identifying very precise objectives, go to Iran to show its solidarity with the Iranian democrats, and certainly not to back, even involuntarily, the clamp-down by the Iranian Government."
"I think that we should discuss all this further and achieve our aim."
"I have decided to use most of my time for this intervention to highlight the names of people who, reportedly, are in detention in Iran, some convicted to death, for criticising the political regime or for defending civil rights."
"Ali Mehrnia, Parviz Varmazyari, Majid Rezaii, Alireza Nabavi, Ali Massoumi and Shirin Alavi Holi are reportedly being detained and subject to the death penalty for 'Mohareb', which means enmity against God."
"Thirty-three women belonging to the Mourning Mothers of Iran, whose children have been killed, disappeared or detained in post-election violence, are being harassed."
"Other women activists and their families are detained: Atefeh Nabavi, Shabnam Madadzadeh, Mahsa Naderi, Fatemeh Ziaee Azad and Nazila Dashti."
"Eight activists from the Committee of Human Rights Reporters are detained: Saeed Kalanaki, Saeed Jalalifar, Shiva Nazar-Ahari, Kouhyar Goudarzi, Saeed Haeri, Parisa Kakayi and Mehrdad Rahimi."
"Four others went into hiding after being summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence: Hesam Misaghi, Saeed Habibi, Navid Khanjani and Sepeher Atefi."
"Others from the Liberal Student and Alumni Association are detained: Mehrdad Bozorg, Ehsan Dolatshah and Sina Shokohi."
"What these people have in common is to have reported on, or voiced, their concerns about the situation in Iran."
"What is the Commission or the Council going to do for the release of those imprisoned for political purposes?"
"What funding does the Commission provide to human rights NGOs working in Iran?"
"(RO) I personally believe that there is great potential for close economic, cultural and political ties between Iran and the European Union."
"However, this potential remains untapped."
"Relations between Iran and the European Union encounter major difficulties when sensitive subjects are touched on, such as Iran's nuclear programme or human rights."
"I think that the Iranian side needs to respond to the desire for dialogue expressed by the European Union."
"Its refusal to engage in dialogue can only limit the transfer of ideas and knowledge on subjects of mutual interest."
"I must remind you that the European Union is Iran's number one trade partner and, given that Iran's objective is to join the World Trade Organisation, a closer commercial partnership with the European Union would help Iran in its attempt to comply with the organisation's standards."
"However, as long as the Iranians display a lack of openness towards cooperation, constructive dialogue between Iran and the European Union will not be possible."
"(IT) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you, Baroness, have drawn a dramatic picture of the situation in this great country which has a great history, a great culture, and a great civilisation."
"There is the suppression of dissent and of the opposition, there are very serious restrictions on civil rights, there are infringements of freedoms, there is a worrying nuclear programme and there is a threat relating to Israel and peace."
"Unfortunately, I have not understood which initiatives Europe intends to implement in order to put an end to this situation, to defend peace, freedom and civil rights."
"I hope that in the debate's conclusions, you can list some facts and some initiatives, some positions to be taken, and perhaps also reply to the suggestion made by Mr Scurria."
"Mr President, as for Parliament, I am part of a delegation which struggled to obtain permission from the Iranian Government to go to Iran, which, when it had to cancel the trip as a protest, was not able to do so, and which also suffered the shame of being forbidden by Iran from visiting."
"I am in favour of dialogue with Iran, but the Italian Parliament and the delegation must forcefully set out our position regarding the defence of freedom and the rights which are under threat."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Iran's current administration blatantly violates human rights and tramples on the fundamental rights of its citizens."
"The most recent evidence of this is the slaying of eight people in connection with the Ashura event and the fact that five members of the opposition are currently awaiting the death sentence."
"Iran's current regime is the biggest threat to world peace."
"It is quite incomprehensible that the international community should be watching from a distance while the Iranian Government has been allowed calmly to develop a military nuclear programme and to disregard the views of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"The country's current leadership is allowed publicly to threaten to destroy another Member State of the United Nations, Israel."
"It also supports the Hezbollah terrorist group, which is active in Lebanon and Syria."
"In a way, these events recall moments from 60 years ago."
"We do not need to think about what we might have done differently to be able to prevent the hatred."
"Today, however, if we take effective action, we can prevent the same thing from happening."
"We have to start to impose economic sanctions against the Iranian administration as soon as possible."
"The situation being as it is, it would be better if the EU's Iran delegation were prevented from going, as the trip would only be exploited by the Mullahs for the purposes of propaganda."
"Let us remember: the problem in this case is not so much that there is so much bad - it is more the case that the good keep silent."
"(PL) Mr President, the end of last year saw the biggest opposition protests in Iran since the demonstrations which followed the presidential election in June, when the serving president was announced victor."
"In clashes with security forces, eight people died, hundreds were injured and hundreds were detained."
"Students supporting the opposition were attacked on the university campus, which brought a reaction from 88 of the university's professors in the form of an appeal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to stop using force against the demonstrators."
"The situation in Iran is causing rising alarm, and this is also true at international level."
"Imposition of sanctions against the government in Tehran is being considered by the Germans, whose Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, has said that Iran has not replied to the West's proposal of cooperation on ending its nuclear programme."
"Israel's Prime Minister has also appealed for the introduction of severe international sanctions against Iran."
"In his opinion, a regime which tyrannises its own people may soon become a threat to the entire world."
"While respecting the sovereignty of Iran, we should strongly stress the responsibility resting on the country's authorities to respect human, political and citizens' rights, and we should also stress the fact that in exercising its right to develop its own nuclear programme, Iran must not, at the same time, pose a threat to international security."
"The patience which the international community has shown in conducting dialogue with Tehran is now coming to an end."
"The world must not be held hostage by the aggressive and provocative policy of the current political leadership in Iran."
"The Spanish Presidency and the head of diplomacy, Mrs Ashton, should initiate talks on this matter with Russia, to include Moscow in a common policy of pressure on Iran."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally, in particular, on the Iranian nuclear issue."
"Consequently, the prospect of additional sanctions seems inevitable, or even desirable."
"I would like to know your point of view on the timetable and the nature of possible sanctions precisely so that we can make a clear link between the internal events in Iran and the nuclear issue."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to carry on listing the reasons for our disagreement with the Iranian Government."
"Since it has not been referred to here, I will only emphasise one of the most serious violations of civil rights, which relates to young people."
"The Iranian Government, having signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nonetheless continues to impose capital punishment on minors."
"After this debate, I would like, firstly, Baroness Ashton, to take on the task of setting out a common approach for Europe as a whole and the European Parliament as a whole on events in Iran and, secondly, the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Iran to note that it must change its line."
"I, together with my friends Mr Scurria and Mr Tatarella, protested to the delegation: in an official statement, it stated that it wanted to visit Iran in any case, even though it had made a peremptory request to have the opportunity to meet and talk to the opposition."
"From now on, I would like the delegation to start singing from a new hymn sheet and to sustain relations of assistance, support and debate with the exiled representatives of the opposition, not least Mrs Myriam Rajavi, who typifies this situation."
"This is what the European Union should be doing, rather than imposing sanctions."
"Mr President, I have to say to Mrs Ashton that our hopes of convincing the Iranian regime of our concerns will, I am afraid, be in vain."
"In fact, we are dealing with a dictatorship of yesterday and what is needed now is to concentrate on the opportunity for change."
"The regime is coming apart at the seams, and the Iranian people have courageously shown, since last June, that they do not trust and do not support this deceitful and aggressive dictatorship."
"Why should we continue to do so?"
"We need seriously to support civil society and the democratic opposition, including the Council of National Resistance, which is the only organisation that has come out with a very clear democratic programme for a nuclear-free Iran."
"(DE) Mr President, the German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, reported today that yesterday, Monday, the office of public prosecution in Tehran demanded the death penalty for five opposition figures."
"According to Amnesty International, these five opposition figures are 17-year old Ali Mehrnia, 54-year old Parviz Varmazyari, plus Majid Rezaii, Alireza Mabavi and Ali Massoumi."
"If a regime like the one in Tehran, which is not only anachronistic but also cracks down on its own population with the death penalty, stonings and other methods, and we, the European Union, do not take the necessary steps, we make ourselves culpable, above all, towards those who would build a reasonable society there, towards the children who grow up under conditions that are anything but those which we - in agreement with my fellow Member, who is, unfortunately, no longer present - would wish for a future society."
"I would like to hear firm and clear words from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy here, and I would like to see us not only call for sanctions against Iran but also to implement such sanctions."
"Mr President, I think it is clear to all of us here that the Iranian regime is a dictatorial and criminal regime."
"The question is: how to deal with it?"
"I would like to state very clearly my support for the delegation that would have gone to Iran from this Parliament."
"The delegation would have met, for one whole day, members of the opposition and dissidents."
"It would have strengthened them."
"They wanted that."
"So I really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place."
"I have one very concrete question to you, Baroness Ashton."
"Several Members here have talked about sanctions."
"From the experience I have as a member of the national parliament and talking with many people for a long time, I would really be in favour of smart sanctions - targeted, for example, at specific members of the Revolutionary Guard, putting them on a veto list for visits, or at other specific persons."
"I am very much against imposing sanctions on the whole country as that would probably strengthen the government, because then poverty would increase - they would not have access, for example, to petrol - and that would help to support the regime instead of weakening it."
"Mr President, I want to agree with Tunne Kelam and Mr Alvaro."
"The day of dialogue and engagement with Iran has long since passed."
"People are dying in the streets almost every day in protests against this fascist regime."
"Only yesterday, as you have heard, a kangaroo court in Tehran called for the death penalty against five protesters arrested during the Ashura riots on 27 December."
"Enough is enough."
"No more talk; no more appeasement."
"We need tough sanctions."
"That is the only way that we will show the ordinary people of Iran that we back their protests."
"(EL) Baroness Ashton, I was delighted to observe your sober stance, informed by respect for a country with the history and pride of Iran."
"Iran is a special case and I am delighted that you are applying the diplomatic approach known as 'smart power', namely sanctions on the one hand and dialogue on the other."
"I would urge you to continue with the dialogue."
"Usually, countries which condemn such countries are very far-removed from the culture and mentality of the countries of Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan."
"I would suggest that you expand the group which you have set up in order to continue with open dialogue with Iran by adding countries that traditionally have good relations with Iran, such as my country, Greece, especially now with its present socialist government."
"The region will not be able to withstand another war."
"I convey here the anxiety, not only of Israel, but also of the Emirates, about Iran's nuclear programme."
"Continue with the dialogue and I think that we shall get somewhere."
"(HU) Three short questions."
"First, the leading Iranian nuclear scientist was recently murdered in a brutal terrorist attack."
"What is the European Union's view about this case?"
"Curiously, there was no mention of it today."
"I deplore that fact very much."
"Secondly, just why is the Iranian nuclear potential a greater problem, more of a danger to peace than, let us say, Israel's?"
"Why is the EU not dealing with that too?"
"Thirdly, in 2006, the socialist liberal government of Hungary of the time ordered shots to be fired into crowds of peaceful demonstrators."
"14 people suffered eye injuries, among others."
"Many of them were blinded."
"Despite our repeated requests, the EU refused then, and refuses still, to deal with this event."
"What is the difference?"
"Similarly, they do not deal with the hundreds of political prisoners that have spent time in jail in Hungary."
"Even today, there are dozens of political prisoners in jail in Hungary."
"Thank you very much, and I look forward to the answer."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the death and disappearance of the body of Seyed Ali Mousavi, the nephew of the leader of the Iranian opposition, is one of many tragic examples that show the current malaise of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"The legitimacy of the Iranian regime following the very dubious elections last June is questionable to say the least."
"Thus, our task is to support Iranian civil society as far as possible in its resistance movement."
"Mrs Ashton, you can be sure of the full support that our Parliament will give you in order to reject this type of behaviour."
"I want to stress that by continuing to deny the role of the opposition, the Iranian regime will be unable to convince us of its will to work for the good of the Iranian people."
"The opposition's right to exist and its right to free competition among parties, allowing the plurality of opinions in Iranian society to be represented, are positive signs that we have long been waiting for."
"However, we are far from seeing that in Iran."
"Certainly, at present, many believe that it is entirely up to the Iranian regime to heed the demonstrators' calls and the wishes of the international community in order to carry out a democratic transition."
"Europe must be the main witness to what is the rule of law."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Iran is a key country, affecting the stabilisation of peace worldwide and in part of the Middle East."
"Of course, it is beyond dispute that we must defend human rights and resolutely express our concern about the violations of the rights of the opposition which have been going on for several months."
"However, I want to say that the European Union should, above all, actively implement an antinuclear programme, because Iran with a nuclear weapon would be a huge threat to a whole part of the Middle East."
"In addition, we know that the instigation of revolution in Yemen and support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip and for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan are probably also the inspiration behind part of Iranian policy."
"In relation to this, what is needed here more than anything is a certain balance, and I think Saudi Arabia should also have an important role to play."
"I think we should see very active dialogue and engagement in this matter on the part of Mrs Ashton."
"(DE) Mr President, in this context, as always, I would like to point out that we here in Europe actually only recognise individual liability and reject blanket suspicion on principle."
"I am sure that, as a Briton, Baroness Ashton might well have great sympathy for the idea of targeting the guilty parties in situations like this with a blockade, but not an entire people, who have found themselves in this situation more or less innocently."
"We should seek talks."
"My question is as follows."
"Do you see possible contacts for dialogue in Iran with whom you could make contact in order to hold a serious and objective discussion in proper political form?"
"I hold no brief for the regime of the Ayatollahs in Iran or for its anti-democratic stances."
"But I would say two things: one is that there is repression of non-violent freedom of speech even in Europe and even among EU members."
"Furthermore, the activities in Iran and the events in Iran are being used quite cynically by the United States and its allies to foment a war movement against Iran, and I think that response would be entirely disproportionate."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think this has been an extremely important and timely debate, first of all, because we have reiterated the commitment that we have in the European Union to the importance of the values of human rights."
"And indeed, in our dialogue with Iran, we ask nothing more than that they live up to the international agreements which they have willingly and voluntarily signed, and that is a fundamental part of the way in which we have to approach these questions, and Members have, both by naming individuals and by describing events in Iran, highlighted the issues which are of the greatest concern to us."
"Members, too, have made the point that in the end, as you said, Mr Gualtieri, the dialogue must be inevitable."
"It is very important that we continue to offer the approach that says 'meaningful dialogue'."
"But I do so recognising that my predecessor, Javier Solana, spent six years in dialogue, six years offering to continue that debate; so, dialogue, but not as an excuse for inaction on behalf of Iran, but rather as a means of making sure that we develop the strength of that relationship and that we achieve what we believe to be important."
"And as part of that, the talks on World Trade Organisation membership, which have been going nowhere for a long time, could be a way in which we could find the kind of debate and discussion and support to enable the regime to move forward."
"Many Members have talked about the importance of sanctions, but I think particularly - intelligent, smart sanctions: the critical importance to all of us of ensuring, as we begin to think about what next, and, if we do, and as we do, consider the possibility of sanctions, that we do so recognising that they must be aimed and targeted specifically to achieve what we wish and that no one in this House wishes to see ordinary people in Iran suffer as a consequence of that."
"That makes that debate very important, but also requires us to invest energy and time within it."
"The E3+3 senior officials met in New York on Saturday and we were able to have the dialogue, including, of course, with Russia, on that issue."
"There is no doubt, as I have said, that, though we wish to take forward the meaningful relationship with Iran through dialogue, ultimately, if Iran rejects this, then, under the dual-track policy that we have, the question of sanctions arises and, indeed, as a consequence of that meeting, consideration of the appropriate further measures has already begun."
"This, too, will be an item for discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, and that is partly why I was so keen to hear honourable Members' views as I prepare for those discussions too."
"In terms of the delegation going to the country, Mrs Lochbihler, you are indeed the chair of the delegation."
"It is very important that it has not yet officially been cancelled."
"I think it would be important to consider whether we should pursue that. I hope that meeting can take place soon, again in the spirit of trying to keep the dialogue open."
"We do, as a result specifically of the action of this Parliament, have Euronews beginning its broadcasts in Farsi in the middle of 2010."
"That is important, too, in terms of communication and looking at how we use communication and technology effectively."
"It is difficult to think about blocking access if, at the same time, we block the access to the information that people wish to get, and that, I think, is something we have to be mindful of."
"And in terms of looking at what we do for the future, honourable Members have made it clear what they wish us to consider."
"As I have said, the E3+3 is already considering these options."
"We have the Foreign Affairs Council."
"I have indicated we want to look at smart, intelligent sanctions as we consider this dual track."
"I have made it clear, and I continue to make it clear, that I am open and ready to have the dialogue - and I described in my opening remarks the potential of this great country - but we do so in the certain knowledge that we cannot continue to use dialogue as a way of preventing action."
"I have to end by saying I was very struck by the phrase that President Obama used in his Nobel Prize reception speech when he said that, when we look at the value of continuing with engagement, 'engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation."
"But [...] no repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door'."
"The door is open for that meaningful dialogue in order to move forward but, in saying that, I am absolutely committed to recognising the twin track that my predecessors laid out and to pursuing that as necessary."
"Dear colleagues, these discussions last from 15.00 to 20.00, which is five hours."
"I suggest that we take a five-minute break in order for the High Representative and everybody else who has been in the Chamber, and will continue in the Chamber, to catch their breath, and that we resume at 17.35: five minutes from now."
"Mr President, before we break, I would just like to give a point of information."
"Baroness Ashton, you were talking about the Iran delegation."
"The delegation was due to go to Iran from 8-10 January, but that delegation visit was cancelled."
"In fact, it was cancelled by the Iranian authorities."
"Many of us pressed for the delegation visit to be cancelled earlier than that - though, in fact, the chair of the delegation took no notice of us - in the light of the testing of long-range missiles, the shooting of demonstrators and all the other disturbances that took place over the Christmas period."
"As a point of information, therefore, that delegation visit has been cancelled, and that action should actually have been taken earlier in Parliament to cancel it."
"I was unaware that there was a 'point of information' procedure."
"Mr Van Orden. I allowed you to go on, but in all fairness to everyone else, this was not a point of order."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the February I part-session in Strasbourg."
"(The sitting was suspended at 17.30 and resumed at 17.35)"
"Situation in Yemen (debate)"
"The sitting is resumed."
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Yemen."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, we know the reason why Yemen is on our agenda today."
"We traced the Detroit bomber's trail from the United States to Europe, to Africa and Yemen."
"Thus, we were reminded, once again, that our own security is at risk if we do not help countries like Yemen, who are struggling to meet multiple challenges at the same time."
"Terrorism is the immediate focus but is only one of an interlinked set of challenges."
"There is instability in the north, fuelled by armed conflict with the Houthi rebels."
"There is conflict over land and water rights and longstanding tensions with the southern region, which has felt marginalised since unification in 1991."
"The government has so far been able to maintain overall stability but, as oil revenues have dwindled, the state is struggling to maintain control over parts of the national territory."
"To this we can add piracy in the Gulf of Aden, smuggling, migration and people-trafficking from the Horn of Africa and, now, a rise in jihadist terrorism."
"Yemen has substantial population growth and an increasingly discontented young population."
"An inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive."
"Amidst all this, one thing is clear: none of us can afford a zone of near-lawlessness stretching from the Horn of Africa to Afghanistan."
"We would pay the price ourselves."
"Over the last 18 months, the European Union has highlighted Yemen as a priority case in its counter-terrorism strategy and its comprehensive approach to state-building and development."
"The Council adopted extensive conclusions on Yemen in October."
"We are now seeking to rally all our key players around the strategy."
"The UK initiative to organise a high-level meeting with and on Yemen next week could, therefore, not be more timely."
"A key focus of the meeting will be security."
"A significant package is now being prepared to help boost government efforts: training and equipment for law enforcement, a better legal framework and criminal justice system, work on anti-radicalisation and conflict prevention."
"This will come on top of EUR 11 million allocated, in the Commission's development programme, to police training and juvenile justice in the last two years."
"The establishment of al-Qaeda in Yemen is a symptom of deeper problems."
"The linkage between economic, political, social and security challenges are crucial."
"This is why we need a comprehensive approach."
"It is also vital that the Yemeni state boosts its capacity to meet the needs of people throughout the country."
"The EU will propose to increase by one third its development funds foreseen for the period 2011-13."
"Humanitarian aid from ECHO will continue in 2010."
"We continuously raise with the government the problems of access to the many displaced people."
"No amount of aid, however, can substitute for commitment and action by the government itself."
"President Saleh's stated commitment to national dialogue amongst all relevant actors has the potential to build a new national consensus, if all actors are included and their interests are taken into account."
"The international community should lend sustained support to this dialogue."
"It is the only sustainable way forward."
"Last, but certainly not least, key regional players need to be engaged in the common effort to work with Yemen - chief amongst these is Saudi Arabia."
"The London meeting offers an invaluable chance to include the Saudis, the United States and others in a meaningful international dialogue on, and with, Yemen."
"I look forward to our debates."
"After the formidable stunt that the Taliban pulled off yesterday in Afghanistan, where, lest we forget, we have 100 000 troops fighting for freedom, and the failed terrorist attack in Detroit this Christmas, I believe, Baroness Ashton, that it is legitimate to wonder whether terrorism is stronger now than when freedom was attacked by the barbarous toppling of the twin towers in New York."
"We have just had a debate on Iran, we can see what is going on in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in the Middle East, in Somalia and even events in the heart of our own continent with the attacks in Madrid and London."
"The question we must ask ourselves - for we must all try to draw conclusions from these events - is whether we are doing well."
"It is true that there is a new factor, Madam President, which is that now we have armies with no apparent enemies and enemies who do not have armies."
"Yet President Obama quickly went into action after the failed attack in Detroit and General Petraeus made his third visit to Yemen within a very short space of time."
"We can see that the United States has mobilised a significant economic aid package and has developed a policy that is producing results."
"You have just spoken to us, Baroness Ashton, of the concrete measures that the European Union is thinking of implementing and you have told us about sums in addition to the EUR 11 million."
"The amount spent by the United States increased from USD 67 million in 2009 to USD 167 million in 2010."
"For this reason, Baroness Ashton, my question is this: do you believe that, when we are faced with terrorism, notions of foreign policy, security, defence, development cooperation and aid, trade - and I would even include culture or civilisation - all merge together and we have to realise that, when faced with dangers and threats that affect us all equally, the response should also be shared by us all equally?"
"You have talked about coordination with the United States."
"Could you tell us the terms on which this cooperation, which is so important and so necessary, is taking place?"
"Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, our group is very worried by the situation in Yemen because there is a global threat there: the failed attempt to blow up a US aircraft, the threats directed towards foreign embassies and the intensification of attacks by al-Qaeda, the most recent being in Afghanistan, must be taken very seriously."
"Unfortunately, Yemen's domestic situation does not help, and we should bear in mind the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world, with serious water shortages, high unemployment and an economy heavily dependent on revenue from oil and gas, which it is estimated will be exhausted within the next 10 years."
"I therefore believe action by the European Union is vital, in the shape of close collaboration between the European Commission, on humanitarian aid and development aspects, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, in relation to common security, collaboration with police forces and border control."
"I must also mention our concern over the clamp-down on representatives of the political opposition in that country, journalists and human rights defenders, which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time."
"Baroness Ashton, I therefore consider it a priority to ensure that humanitarian organisations can enter Yemeni territory and work in complete security."
"I also hope for an effort by the European Union to ensure that Yemen abides by the commitments made in 2006 at the international donors' conference, namely to step up the process of political and economic reforms, to increase democracy and people's living standards."
"Since the September 11 attack, we have realised that making at-risk areas secure depends on how much we are prepared to gamble on better living conditions."
"Baroness Ashton, democracy starts from here, from the ability to close the gaps between the rich countries and the poorest countries."
"Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new."
"Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious."
"I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen."
"We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation."
"I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe."
"The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place."
"We - and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also - must consider what we can do to counter these risks."
"As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks?"
"All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas - from the freedom of the media to women's rights - here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so."
"Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - I will continue a bit on what the previous speaker said."
"Yemen is certainly not a new crisis: it has been deteriorating for decades, and the worsening political situation was clearly stated in the Commission's mid-term review."
"I think we really need to focus on the political context: the longstanding conflict in the north between the government and the Houthis, the unrest in the south, you mentioned these - and now the northern conflict is spreading in the region and concerning Saudi Arabia and Iran."
"So the question is: what, precisely, to do."
"I have heard calls just now for the stability instrument for a CSDP mission to pour money into training more people, but I think that this is not sufficient as an approach - at least it is not a crisis response, unless we accept the concept of permanent crisis."
"I think we should push for greater involvement by the Gulf Cooperation Council in Yemen, not just Saudi Arabia."
"We need this organisation to bring together the various Yemeni parties, the government, the opposition, southern secessionists, Houthis and regional actors in some kind of peace-like process, and I think that should be supported and financed by the Stability Instrument for example; that is what I think the stability instrument should be for."
"If we have another CSDP mission and another round of Stability Instrument training without a political process leading somewhere, I do not think it will help us."
"I really urge you to use the Stability Instrument more as an early-warning political instrument to move on a political process, and to support and finance that."
"I think that that would be, from my perspective, something worthwhile."
"I would like to add another point: gender equality has been mentioned, and you raised that, and I think we really should invest heavily in that."
"Population growth is one of the main concerns in those countries, and, as we all know, we will not solve that issue until we have family planning, and that means women's rights."
"I know that you will not push for major women's rights, but I think gender equality and especially family planning is crucial if we are now considering what to do in order to help Yemeni society."
"Madam President, the eyes of the whole world were on Yemen recently, after al-Qaeda activists there claimed responsibility for what was, fortunately, an unsuccessful attempt to blow up an American airliner at Christmas."
"However, we have known for a long time that the deteriorating state of security in the country is allowing terrorist groups to find refuge from where they can plan and organise further operations."
"Terrorism had been spreading in the region for many years before 9/11, a day we all remember."
"We need only recall the al-Qaeda attack on the American warship, the USS Cole, on 12 October 2000."
"Yemen is an extremely significant country, in particular, because of its geographical location."
"We must remember that 3.5 million barrels of crude oil, which is 4% of world production, are transported every day through the 26.5-kilometre Bab-el-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and Djibouti."
"At the same time, it is a country with a very complicated internal situation."
"Apart from al-Qaeda, which is thriving there, there is also a serious Shi'ite rebellion in Saada Province in the north of the country and an outbreak of violence from secessionist movements in the south."
"If we add to this the negative effects of the world food crisis of two years ago, the recent financial crisis, the country's dwindling reserves of crude oil, which account for three-quarters of its income, and finally an increasingly serious water shortage, we have a picture of a country on its knees, the ideal target for al-Qaeda, which, in view of its problems in Afghanistan, is looking for a new base."
"Therefore, apart from military action which, in one form or another, would appear to be unavoidable in view of the passivity and helplessness of the local authorities, the international community, including the European Union - and here I appeal to Mrs Ashton - must, above all, be very active in the process of rebuilding state institutions."
"Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror."
"At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open."
"The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi'ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there."
"There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi'ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid."
"Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided - doing so merely pours further oil on the fire."
"Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation."
"A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states - such as Iran - must be initiated and promoted."
"We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels."
"Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations."
"We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US's completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, rather than being a new frontier of terrorism, as someone dubbed it, Yemen is a country of precarious stability."
"The central government's lack of control over the territory and the permeability of the borders are allowing illegal trafficking, unchecked migration, piracy and terrorist activities to grow."
"The response to the new challenges of al-Qaeda in Yemen should not, however, just consist of military pressure, but also of helping the local authorities to gain better control over the territory."
"I repeat: the local authorities, and not just the government."
"Yemen's stability should, however, be brought about with a view to national and regional ownership, without imposing external or pre-prepared solutions which are often at odds with the situation on the ground and are doomed to failure."
"This would facilitate greater commitment by the Gulf Cooperation Council, whose financial participation in local projects would be crucial."
"The European Union should work together with its partners - Yemen, the G8 and Gulf countries - with financial and development contributions backed by the Yemeni Government."
"To conclude, policies which, although excellent, are long-term ones, should be accompanied by immediate strong support for security and control over the territory, without which we risk the failure of the Yemeni State and a huge growth in terrorism in the area."
"(DE) Madam President, it is well known that Yemen is currently a hotbed of Islamic extremists, a poverty-stricken country with ineffective security and a high density of weapons that is convulsed with conflicts and suffers from an acute water shortage."
"It is a country in which the government appears not even to have the capital completely under control."
"Yemen has thus found itself in the spotlight of the fight against terrorism and is therefore another country in which the presence of radical Islamists is an unfortunate consequence of past US policy failings."
"That should be very consciously borne in mind in the debate, along with the CIA's overflights, the secret prisons and the disastrous consequences of the US campaigns thus far in the Middle East."
"In my opinion, it would be naive to equate terrorism with poverty, just as it would be irresponsible to allow ourselves to be dictated to by US policy and to trustingly believe that only increasing military aid to Yemen could solve the problems there."
"The dictatorial president is quite happy to collect the West's military millions, but in the past he has time and again fallen back on Islamists in order to permanently silence opponents of the regime."
"Of course, we cannot stand idly by and watch as this country is transformed from a retreat area of the Jihadists, which it has been so far, into their operations and training base."
"There is also a clear need to discuss how to improve development aid, even if only to take a proportion of the Jihadist recruits out of the equation."
"Finally, the EU must not allow itself to be forced into the role of the US paymaster."
"Instead, the Union must assume the role of an impartial broker in order to bring about a dialogue and pave the way for a long-term political solution."
"Madam President, I have a short comment and two questions to put to Baroness Ashton."
"It seems that the EU is now faced with a dilemma."
"On the one hand, we need to support more robust action against terrorists who directly pose a danger to the security of European citizens."
"Various Islamist extremist groups in Yemen have been more active than ever before, and al-Qaeda sees Yemen as one of its most important areas to plan attacks on Western targets and to train militia and potential suicide bombers."
"The failed operation against the Northwest Airlines plane is the most recent example of the threat we face."
"On the other hand, one should know that the Yemeni authorities have more than once been accused by various human rights organisations of torture, inhumane treatment and extrajudicial executions."
"Arbitrary arrests of citizens and searches of homes are widespread, and the need to fight terrorism has been cited as the main excuse for such unlawful actions."
"In this context, Baroness Ashton, referring to the Council conclusions on Yemen, what kind of support has the EU to offer to Yemen in terms of fighting terrorism?"
"In addition, the EU considers that there is no military solution for the crisis in the area."
"At the same time, Washington has signed the agreement with the Yemeni authorities on closer military cooperation."
"So, I would appreciate your opinion and the position of the European Union on the decision by the Americans to engage more actively in Yemen to fight terrorists, especially by signing the agreement on military intelligence and training."
"Madam President, I welcome today's debate in advance of next week's Foreign Affairs Council and the London conference called by Gordon Brown."
"Our attention may have been generated by the attempted airline bomber."
"Today I also appeal for international attention to address efforts to free the British engineer, Anthony S., and five other European hostages, who worked at a local hospital in Yemen and who remain kidnapped since last June."
"To combat levels of malnutrition that exceed some sub-Saharan African countries, such as Niger, and violations of human rights, as Mrs Andrikienhas just said, in a country which inflicts the 11th highest number of executions in the world, including children. So that, as an international community, we do not wait for the terrorists to move in before we begin to address issues of capacity, governance and development in fragile states in our world."
"I welcome the High Representative's announcement today on aid and ask her to ensure that next week's meetings address actual commitments of aid money to Yemen, from all participants, at a time when the UN's consolidated appeal for the country has generated less than 1% of the funds needed."
"Like Mrs Brantner, that the meetings pursue a ceasefire, and perhaps a peace conference, on the latest round of fighting with the Houthis in the north and to ensure humanitarian access to the region."
"To ensure the country's oil revenue should be invested in economic and social development for the country's people."
"That Europe should cooperate in finding lasting solutions for Yemeni prisoners, the largest contingent left in Guantánamo Bay."
"But I do hope the High Representative will explore the potential for a joint EU-Gulf Cooperation Council CSDP project on security sector training in Yemen, in which our efforts are critically important in so many countries."
"Finally, the Bin Ladens may come from the village of Al-Rubat in Yemen, but it is the absence of international engagement which has allowed too many of the country's young people to be radicalised in his name."
"It is international engagement which now must take place."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, an attempted attack is enough to remove any sense of triviality from the affirmation of the right to security of our fellow citizens."
"The protection of our societies obliges us moreover to permanently look for a balance between security and freedom."
"The right to protection, in particular from a terrorist attack, is laid down by Article 188R of the Treaty of Lisbon, and more precisely in its Article 4, which empowers the European Union and its Member States to act in an effective manner."
"The same paragraph makes clear that the European Council must conduct a regular evaluation of the threats faced by the European Union. I would like to ask Mrs Ashton to clarify to me whether, and to what extent, the European Union and its Member States have acted in line with this clause."
"From her point of view, can cooperation within the European Union allow her to maintain that failings by the US intelligence service, which came to light in the case of the recent attempted attack on flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit, could not have happened in the European Union?"
"One question is absolutely central to this debate: was the name of the suspected terrorist known to European intelligence services, to all the European intelligence services?"
"If not, what conclusions does she expect to draw?"
"Does she consider, at present, that the level of coordination and exchange of information between the intelligence services is good enough to rule out this type of failing in the European Union?"
"Does the High Representative consider as sufficient the capacity of Member States' intelligence services to cooperate in the spirit of solidarity set out in Article 188R?"
"Indeed, citizens have the right to demand faultless monitoring of the terrorist threat."
"They would find it hard to understand how, on the one hand, the European Union continues to send more and more SWIFT-type personal data to the United States and how, on the other, the same European Union has shortcomings in the area of prevention and intelligence."
"Madam President, unfortunately, Yemen long ago developed the characteristics of a terrorist incubator and not enough attention has been paid to this over the years."
"Conflict, lawlessness and corruption are deeply embedded."
"It is worth recalling, by the way, that the reason that British troops intervened in Yemen in the early 19th century was to put an end to piracy in the Gulf of Aden and they were very successful for over a century."
"In more recent years, of course, Yemen has both developed as a terrorist incubator, where terrorist acts have taken place, and exported terrorism to other countries."
"Terrorist groups are adept at exploiting the possibilities provided by failed states."
"We need to help counter this."
"At the moment, the UK is disproportionately providing assistance."
"I hope that the London conference will encourage other countries to do more, including the European Union, and, I agree, other regional states."
"Of course, we cannot hope to snuff out terrorism wherever it breeds, and that means we must improve the security of our own countries and have more effective controls on our own borders."
"I doubt that the EU is motivated properly on this, so each of our own countries needs to put its house in order."
"(EL) Madam President, the people of Yemen are the victims of imperialist conflict and intervention."
"The imperialist powers are, I believe, fomenting ethnic, racial and religious infighting in this country."
"For years, they have frequently resorted to military force."
"They are undermining the peaceful resolution of differences so that they can control energy reserves and the energy transmission channels in the area."
"Developments in this country have always been the result of the imperialist choices of NATO policy and the policy of supporting the deeply reactionary and anti-grassroots regime in this country."
"With the huge increase in financial and military aid from the United States on the pretext of fighting al-Qaeda, together with the classification of Yemen as a country which conceals terrorists, the bombing of areas of the country by Saudi forces, with the assistance of the USA, and the presence of foreign troops, it is possible that open military imperialist intervention will escalate."
"That is clear from the new breakout of hysteria following the attempted terrorist attack on the Delta aircraft."
"I believe that the peoples will respond by stepping up the fight against the repressive measures and imperialist interventions against them."
"Madam President, as the fictional Lady Bracknell might have said, to make one major mistake in the Muslim world is unfortunate, but to make two sounds like carelessness."
"To make three or more is an indication of stupidity, insanity or deliberate mischief-making."
"Yemen is now being called the new Afghanistan."
"US troops are already being deployed there as advisers."
"How long before they and their allies, including Britain, are deploying ground troops there against al-Qaeda?"
"What should the West in fact be doing to prevent the threat?"
"First of all, it should stop wars in Muslim countries that are killing Western troops, killing civilians and radicalising young Muslims at home and abroad."
"It should bring the troops home to work on homeland security to protect our populations and infrastructures."
"It should adopt a genuinely neutral policy towards the Middle East and abandon the partisan policy of the US, and it should stop immigration from Muslim countries and encourage radical Muslims in the West to see that they would be much happier living among their own coreligionists."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, over recent months, the conditions for the people, as well as the overall political and economic situation, have dramatically deteriorated in Yemen."
"We Europeans must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country."
"High Representative, might I ask you to please prevent Yemen from becoming a second Afghanistan."
"We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism."
"We will only be able to achieve that, however, if we also support a peace process in Yemen."
"We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there."
"The Yemeni Government could also be reminded, once again, that it needs to ensure that there is no discrimination in Yemen - only then can there be peace."
"Peace requires democratic structures that uphold the rights of minorities."
"That is our European path, and it may differ from other paths."
"I ask you, in your new role, to spare no efforts to walk this European path with us."
"Without political stability, Yemen has no chance."
"With political stability, the local economy can recover, then an economy can be built up and people can be given future prospects."
"I ask you to work hard for this."
"I also ask you to make your influence count to ensure that the auxiliary troops there can provide humanitarian assistance."
"There are over 130 000 refugees from Somalia in Yemen."
"The situation on the ground is dreadful."
"I put all my hopes on you, Baroness Ashton, in the expectation that you will use your influence here."
"Please also stand up for the six hostages, for the European citizens - one Briton and five Germans - who are being held as hostages in Yemen."
"Maybe you can also help to get them freed. Many thanks."
"(LT) I agree with the Commission and my fellow Members who have said that the situation in Yemen is tense."
"The country is exhausted and impoverished by endless partisan wars and separatist fighting and people are suffering from extreme poverty."
"Such economic and political instability has already caused concern in neighbouring countries of the Arabian peninsula and threatens not just regional but global security."
"News about the recent intensification of the activities of terrorist groups is worrying."
"Let us also remember the failed attempt to blow up a plane flying to the USA, as well as threats against embassies in Yemen."
"The USA has already announced that it will devote special attention to the situation in this country."
"Therefore, while implementing a common foreign policy, I think that it is the duty of the European Parliament, the European Commission and other institutions, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to take joint and coordinated action together with the international community."
"(SL) I will speak in Slovene, so please listen to the interpretation."
"Yemen is a country troubled by religious and tribal conflicts and by mistakes made by past colonial and US policies."
"As some of our fellow Members have said, we are dealing here firstly, with the Near and Middle East, an unstable region and one riddled with unresolved problems, and secondly, of course, with the mother of all conflicts, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Yemen is representative of all these problems and we should not delude ourselves into thinking that we are dealing with a local problem."
"Yemen is struggling with a civil war, al-Qaeda strongholds, a weak state, poor intelligence services, inefficient security and armed military forces."
"What may we expect from the London conference?"
"Madam High Representative, in my view, the hardest thing of all will be to formulate a holistic approach, but that is precisely what we need to do."
"That alone will solve Yemen's problems."
"We need an economic and developmental approach and we need to offer Yemen the kind of assistance that will help it build its state and administrative capacities."
"However, I am of the opinion that the second report, which I would like you, Mrs Ashton, to present, is about us not deluding ourselves into thinking - let no one delude themselves into thinking - that this is merely another issue or another problem that can be resolved by military means."
"I fear that there are many indications, especially in the world media, to the effect that we are preparing for a new frontline, for a new armed conflict."
"That would be the worst thing that could happen in Yemen and something that would probably poison relations in the entire region even more."
"We have drawn enough lessons from the military adventures we have witnessed, from the Near and Middle East to Afghanistan and a few other places."
"Madam President, we debated earlier the deteriorating human rights situation and brutal fascist regime in Iran."
"We heard in that debate how the mullahs have exported terrorism to Palestine and Lebanon, and how now they are exporting their vile brand of terror to Yemen."
"In late October, Yemeni officials reported that they had intercepted a vessel laden with weapons from Iran."
"They arrested five Iranian instructors."
"The weapons and the instructors were destined for the Houthi rebels."
"Iran is a past master at fighting wars by proxy; it did so in both Palestine and Lebanon."
"Now it wishes to foment a proxy regional conflict with Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia."
"I would say to Baroness Ashton that if she deals decisively with Iran, she will cut out much of the malignant cancer that threatens the Middle East."
"(IT) Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the serious political, economic and social crisis in Yemen is linked to the operational presence of al-Qaeda on its territory and the jihadist vision that motivates it."
"Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world and the management of internal conflicts bristles with difficulties because of the religious origins of the conflict between the Shi'ite and Sunni minorities."
"As the motion for a resolution stresses, aid, cooperation and support for the implementation of social assistance programmes are vital."
"We should, however, stress the risks that the West also runs if the security problems are not tackled clearly and with determination."
"The reasons that drive terrorists to acquire military training and train in acts of martyrdom are the product of jihadist ideology, which is becoming increasingly widespread and entrenched on the African continent too, partly because of the indifference and superficiality with which the international community has dealt, or rather has not dealt, with al-Qaeda and its cells in Somalia and Sudan, as well as in Yemen."
"We should remember the cause and effect relationship between the terrorist presence in Yemen and the number of acts carried out to destabilise Somalia, which is a pawn controlled by al-Qaeda forces in Yemen."
"These in turn are dependent not so much on the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia as on the Iranian ayatollahs, from whom they receive weapons and money."
"Support for Yemen cannot be divorced from the issue of security."
"(FR) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country."
"We must not confuse the causes and the consequences, and without playing down the terrorist risk, the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism."
"Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts."
"From this point of view, the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh."
"At regional level, there are - as we have just been reminded - links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa."
"There are very sizeable migratory flows, but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia."
"In this respect, I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities, which also concern Yemen."
"(PL) Madam President, Yemen is the poorest country of the Arab world."
"I was in Yemen not long ago and saw this with my own eyes."
"There is no doubt that poverty is the source, or at least a factor, which intensifies some of the many problems the country faces."
"Unfortunately, in the global world, Yemen's problems are also becoming our problems."
"The internal conflicts referred to in the draft resolution and during this debate should be resolved by political means, and the sides in the conflicts should respect human rights and international humanitarian law."
"The European Union should make efforts to prevent escalation of the present crisis."
"The development aid which we give, if it is effective and if it is sensibly spent, can be of help in bringing about political, economic and social stabilisation."
"However, a catastrophe is not far away."
"The water deficit has been mentioned, as have the dwindling reserves of crude oil, but there is also the problem of the abuse by 90% of Yemenis of qat, a hallucinogenic narcotic, which is displacing other crops."
"For example, Yemen used to export coffee, but now it cannot do this, because this narcotic is being grown instead."
"The government in Yemen and the international community must not just take stop-gap measures, because they are faced with structural problems, and even if we can stop al-Qaeda in Yemen, the problems will return if we do not eliminate the causes."
"(EL) Madam President, as we have already heard and as we all realise, the situation in Yemen is drastic from a social and economic point of view and from the point of view of social cohesion."
"The country has no water, oil reserves are running out and the inhabitants are growing drug crops."
"It is exactly what Afghanistan was 26 years ago when, in this Chamber - I mean in the old Chamber of the European Parliament - we made provision during the debate of the report on narcotics for the future of Afghanistan."
"If there is no development-type intervention right now, and if the UN is not allowed to have a constant presence at all levels, Yemen will certainly find itself in the same situation as Afghanistan is today, with unresolved problems."
"There are not many ways to combat terrorism and the way in which the West is going about it is certainly not one of them."
"The only way to help this country not to become an al-Qaeda outpost is for it to come to agreement with all the Arab countries, not just Saudi Arabia and, of course, we need to make efforts to help this nation move away from a tribal philosophy and civil conflict and to seek democratic rights."
"(RO) The failed bomb attempt on 25 December on board the Amsterdam-Detroit flight actually only served to reveal an important fact."
"It focused the international community's attention on the seriousness of the situation in Yemen because, as is well known, there are not one, but three conflicts going on in this country."
"Apart from the battle involving the separatist movement in the south, the conflict in Saada province in the north has been reignited by the offensive launched approximately six months ago by government forces against the al-Huthi Shi'ite rebels, and air strikes have been carried out against al-Qaeda bases."
"The humanitarian situation, as was also mentioned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 5 January, is deeply concerning and is at risk of deteriorating even further if none of these conflicts end."
"Looking ahead to the international conference being held next week in London, I believe that the European Union must encourage a coordinated response in order to ensure this country's stability, which could also contribute to international security."
"The path to a united, stable and democratic Yemen lies, in my view, through drafting a consistent plan for boosting both military and economic support and for combating terrorism, which needs to be backed up by specific measures supporting this country's economic development. Thank you."
"(SV) Yemen is not just a safe haven for al-Qaeda."
"That has been made clear in the debate here."
"The country could very well develop into a battlefield between two of the major powers of the region: Saudi Arabia and Iran."
"The Yemeni Government has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the Shi'ite rebellion movement."
"This is repudiated by Iran, but such accusations have, in fact, also been made in the Saudi media."
"The evidence cited for this includes the statement by the Yemeni Government that it stopped an Iranian delivery of arms to the rebel movement in October 2009 and the fact that in recent months, the Iranian state media has been covering the struggle of the Shia rebel movement more intensively and benevolently than previously."
"Eighty-two Saudi soldiers have died in the conflict with the rebels in Yemen since Saudi Arabia began its offensive on 4 November 2009."
"As has been pointed out, Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world - but it has also found itself squeezed between the major powers of the region, Iran and Saudi Arabia."
"I wonder whether Mrs Ashton can confirm this and also carry out an analysis of the situation?"
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to agree with the evaluation of the situation presented by Mrs Ashton."
"You are right, Mrs Ashton, that if we want to change the situation in Yemen, we need both humanitarian and, perhaps, military action."
"If this range of measures is to be a broad one, it also requires coordination, because it is not only the European Union which is responsible for improving the situation in Yemen."
"There are many such institutions."
"In relation to this, I would like to ask the following question: do you not think the work of the UN and the European Union on humanitarian issues should be better coordinated?"
"In the area of military matters and reconnaissance, we also need better cooperation with NATO and intelligence services - I am thinking specifically about the intelligence services of particular countries."
"For these measures must be coordinated, because they would then be significantly more effective."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, my question relates to the forms of cooperation, in your view, that we, the European Union, should develop in Yemen, for example, in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, or perhaps in the area of the provision of energy and water supplies, as communication and building up connections could play a special role in future."
"Which programmes would have priority here, for you, High Representative?"
"(PL) Madam President, the President of the European Parliament nearly had to express condolences to the families of almost 300 victims, who were in an airliner flying from Amsterdam to Detroit."
"He would have done this yesterday."
"This did not happen by accident."
"This dramatic incident was necessary for the world to discover the problem of Yemen - a new source of terrorism."
"We stand helpless, faced by a situation like we once faced in Afghanistan."
"We stand helpless, faced by what is happening today in Yemen, and Europe and this building are full of the misguided voices of the human rights defenders who felt sorry for the prisoners of Guantánamo."
"Those prisoners were released, and are now organising attacks again."
"Once again, people are going to die, and we are going to say we are powerless."
"I want to endorse in full what was said by Mr Zemke - without military cooperation, without cooperation on intelligence and without the cooperation of institutions whose role it is to pursue terrorism, we are going to put the health and lives of our citizens at risk."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, once again, an important and wide-ranging debate on an area of the world where we have, for some years, had a focus."
"I was reflecting on the fact that, over the period 2007-2010, EUR 100 million have been spent by the Commission in support and a similar amount will be spent in the future but nonetheless, an area where we have reflected again on the importance of sustainable and coordinated effort, as many Members have pointed out."
"I think that Mrs Salafranca's comments at the beginning have been picked up and reflected again in a number of contributions about how we can make sure that our coordination is effective in terms of security, in terms of the political and economic coming together to address the concerns that this nation faces."
"Mrs Giannakou raised the question of dwindling water and dwindling oil;"
"I think Yemen is the first country that is expected to run out of water by about 2015, something which we have to see as a real and significant challenge."
"In order to address this, we have to look at an integrated approach; a number of Members raised the question of what is the strategy which we should pursue."
"Let me try and outline a few of the key elements of that: first of all, the issues of security and counter terrorism."
"As we approach the London meeting, we need to collaborate effectively on this, a point raised by a number of Members: we need to get the package of assistance together and focus on the work that we are already undertaking, for example, in the Atalanta mission off the coast and the importance of that."
"The issue of improving maritime surveillance is being looked at right now; it was the subject of a discussion I had recently with the Spanish Defence Minister to see what more can be done in order to coordinate better and more effectively to deal with maritime security, bearing in mind the length of coast and the amount of space that have to be covered."
"I think, too, that we have described this comprehensive approach of how to link together the different elements and engage the neighbours of Yemen."
"Mrs Brantner, you raised particularly the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"I agree: a very significant part of how we try and address this area is to work collaboratively with the neighbours around the region and again the London meeting will, I hope, bring together the key Member States from around the area who can help us."
"The London meeting is that opportunity, of course, to pull together our thinking and to do so with the United States and with others."
"We are engaging with the United States."
"It is not true to say that their approach is confined to counterterrorism: they also support and are fully on board with what we describe as our 'root causes' approach, again the mixture of things which we need to do to ensure that we support this country."
"To answer the specific point on security, the EU Home Affairs informal meeting is taking place in Spain this weekend."
"I understand the American counterpart will be there in order to have discussions on the points which Members have raised."
"I agree with the comment that this is not a Christmas tree or wish list."
"We have to be very selective about what we believe we can do to make a difference; helping Yemen to have the type of dialogue it needs to have internally in order to support the people and to try and resolve some of the conflicts which occur in that country is going to be just as significant in my view as anything else we do."
"Asked about finding the right kind of support, the stability instruments too, can be used appropriately, I think, to provide the level of support, but this is no substitute, and could never substitute, for trying to support the government to have the internal dialogue that only they can have."
"Partners have to engage in Yemen to be able to address the problems which are of greatest significance for that."
"So for me, this has been a very useful debate, I am very grateful, because again it helps me in my mind to set the agenda of the issues that I will take to the Foreign Affairs Council as we debate this and then on to London engaging, as I have indicated, with the government on all the elements where we can provide continuing support to develop the country economically, to deal with counter terrorism, to deal with the issues of support from the neighbourhood, too."
"I think a final point is to recognise the plight of the hostages which has been raised a number of times: six hostages, one British, five German including some very young children with the German family who have been taken hostage."
"I know that Minister Westerwelle, the German Foreign Minister, was recently in Yemen."
"He and I spoke about it this week, and our thoughts will always go to the hostages who are suffering at the present time."
"We will take all of these issues into the meeting in London and I am very grateful again to honourable Members for raising these important matters."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in February."
"We have long seen the convergence of powerful geo-strategic interests in the vast area encompassing the Middle and Near East, Central Asia and Northern Africa, including the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where Yemen has a strategic position (next to Somalia)."
"These interests are increasingly being defended by military means, and with ever greater aggressiveness."
"The current situation in Yemen and the terrible suffering to which its people are being subjected should be analysed in the light of this situation."
"The growing military involvement of the US and the EU in the region must be understood and denounced accordingly."
"A brutal and disgusting manifestation of this, which we strongly condemn, was the US cruise missile bombardment of what was alleged to be an al-Qaeda terrorist base, but which is said to have resulted in dozens of civilian casualties."
"The real solution to the complex problems and dangers that menace the people of the region has to come about through demilitarisation, respect for national laws and the sovereignty of the people, and genuine cooperation that aims at the resolution of the profound social problems that they are facing."
"Madam President, regarding the problem of security and economic and political stabilisation in Yemen, a problem which has manifested itself fairly often recently, I would like, as a member of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the Arab Peninsula, to express my concern."
"Yemen, which is the poorest country in the Arab world, has become an object of the special interest of terrorist groups, which, taking advantage of its weakness, have turned it into a base for terrorist attacks far beyond its borders."
"According to observers, Yemen is at risk of breaking up as a result of the Shi'ite rebellion in the north, the separatist movement in the south and the terrorist activity of al-Qaeda."
"Therefore, I appeal for a strengthening of bilateral relations with Yemen and for drawing up plans for the most effective methods of improving security and the political situation, especially in connection with the special meeting on this subject being organised by Gordon Brown for 28 January in London."
"Situation in Iraq (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Iraq."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, when we look at Iraq today, we see real progress, though the country still faces a multitude of challenges."
"But I want to focus today on the present and the future of Iraq, as a country with great potential and notable achievements over the past months."
"Violence today is at its lowest since 2003."
"Although we have seen terrible attacks targeting government institutions, the total number of civilian deaths in 2009 was less than half of the level of 2008."
"Inter-sectarian violence, a major problem in 2006 and 2007, has been significantly reduced."
"Iraq has a new constitution and has conducted several elections with high participation at great risk."
"Thanks to the courage of the Iraqi people, democratic institutions have taken root."
"Provincial elections last year went fairly smoothly all over Iraq."
"Crucially, the next general elections, due on 7 March 2010, can be another big step towards consolidating the Iraqi democracy."
"For our part, this means our work to support Iraq must continue, and move into new areas as the situation improves."
"The European Union has provided more than EUR 1 billion in assistance to Iraq since 2003."
"It has gone towards basic services, human development, refugees, good governance, political process and capacity building - all in accordance with Iraqi priorities."
"Our Integrated Rule of Law Mission, EUJUST LEX, has been extended several times at Iraqi request and is now also training inside Iraq."
"The EU has been playing a leading role in electoral assistance, and we will continue to assist Iraq in this and other areas until Iraqi institutions can assume full responsibility themselves."
"As there is good progress, we are focusing more and more on Iraqi ownership and long-term sustainability."
"We are also developing our relations with Iraq."
"We have just signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Energy Cooperation, and we will soon sign a partnership and cooperation agreement, the first contractual relationship between the EU and Iraq."
"It will cover issues from political dialogue to trade and regulatory cooperation and development assistance."
"We want a broader and deeper political dialogue with Iraq, which should also cover human rights."
"Parliament has taken a keen interest in Iraq, and we expect to see even more cooperation between the European Parliament and the Iraqi Council of Representatives in the future."
"Clearly, Iraq must deal with the many challenges."
"The upcoming general elections will be crucial, and should be free and fair."
"With our international partners, we will be following them very closely."
"The EU will be deploying an Election Assessment Team to Iraq to assess the election and make targeted recommendations."
"Honourable Members, Iraq is on a positive trajectory."
"I am confident it will use its new institutions to find the compromises necessary for national reconciliation."
"For our part, we will continue to stand by Iraq and continue our support together with the UN and the rest of the international community."
"I look forward to our debate."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the High Representative for her words, which struck the necessary note of optimism."
"There are, indeed, positive signs."
"Amongst other things, you made reference to the lower number of deaths resulting from attacks, and the forthcoming elections."
"Yet, Baroness Ashton, even successful elections do not make a democracy, nor do they make a state under the rule of law."
"To quote a great German, Schiller, in your native English, Baroness, 'The voice of the majority is no proof of justice'."
"A mature democracy also recognises the rights of minorities."
"I do have serious concerns in that area."
"I find it disappointing that the word 'minorities' did not come up in what you had to say to the House."
"Why am I worried?"
"Human Rights Watch continues to report that non-Muslim minorities are being persecuted."
"Since 2004, there have been attacks on 65 churches."
"Local militias continue to drive Christians from their homes."
"The day before yesterday, a 52-year old greengrocer, a father of two daughters, was shot dead in the middle of the street in Mosul."
"This, of course, leads to the ongoing flight of Christian minorities from Iraq."
"In 1991, they still numbered 850 000; after the Gulf War they numbered 550 000, while after the US invasion this number was down to 385 000, 100 000 of whom are internally displaced people."
"The European Union cannot continue to stand idly by in this situation."
"Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union refers to human rights, including the rights of minorities, as literally one of the core values of the European Union."
"We require respect for minorities of our 27 Member States and it is your job, Baroness Ashton, to command that respect at the international level, too."
"Thus far, the Commission's approach - and you said so yourself - has been heavily focussed on general support for infrastructure and building up democracy, via the UN or otherwise."
"You say that we act in accordance with Iraq's priorities."
"I would like you to tell us how you will be ensuring that the European Union's Iraq policy and its Iraq budget give greater consideration to vulnerable minorities."
"That is perhaps not Iraq's top priority, but it is ours."
"I would appreciate a response from you."
"Madam President, Commissioner Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the European Parliament to take the opportunity offered by this debate with a view to the March elections in Iraq."
"The Iraqi political process has shown itself to be important - even if, as you were saying, interesting - but still very fragile."
"It is thus even more important to do everything possible to consolidate and strengthen the country's new institutions and the political equilibrium which sustains them."
"We believe this to be a vital objective if we wish the first substantial withdrawal of US troops to occur in August without it having serious consequences on the country's internal situation."
"The coexistence of Shi'ites, Sunnis and Kurds which is today embodied in the federal structures should be guaranteed by new laws, as well as by a political consensus involving all these parties."
"On this point, concerns are being aroused - and we would also like your view on this - by the electoral commission's recent decision to bar many candidates and parties with close links to Sunnis or Christians, thus running the risk of weakening the already fragile democratic process in Iraq."
"Through the measures undertaken, the European Union must follow this electoral process, as you have said, but also be more ambitious in the development of relations with Iraq."
"The Union's EUJUST LEX programme directly involves us in the process of improving Iraqi legislation and democratic institutions, and we, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, consider it a positive sign that the Council has decided to extend the mission until 30 August 2010."
"The EU should continue to maintain strong support for Iraq through its cooperation programmes, with the aim of participating in the process to stabilise and develop the country, and after the elections, it should strengthen relations between the parliaments."
"It should be remembered that many Member States are working with Iraq, including Italy, with the important cultural cooperation programme."
"Iraq's political equilibrium is essential not only for the country but also in terms of the role that Iraq can play in the region strategically, with the aim of overcoming existing conflicts and securing peace."
"In this sense, the improvement of relations with Turkey by the regional government of Kurdistan constitutes a positive step in that direction."
"However, as we know, Iraq remains a country with very serious problems in relation to security, respect for democracy and human rights, as well as economic insecurity."
"It is the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees - forming 10% of the population - ethnic minorities, women, religious minorities and children who are suffering the negative impact of this situation."
"We must therefore play a still more incisive role in this area - I am just finishing - partly through support for local and European NGOs working in Iraq and, in this regard, women can also be involved as strategic figures to overcome some of the population's difficulties."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the fact is that Iraq is not secure."
"That is a fact."
"If we look at Iran, Iran is trying to get much more influence than necessary in Iraq in the south - throughout the whole south, via the Shia minority."
"I did not hear the High Representative mention the position of Iran."
"Iran is threatening Iraq."
"How does she see the role of the European Union in keeping Iran where it should be - in Iran and not in Iraq?"
"Regarding the north, we see that there is a big problem between Turkey and Iraq concerning Kurdistan."
"Of course, there can be legitimacy in fighting guerrillas in the north of Iraq which threaten Turkey, but that is the point."
"The autonomous region in the north of Iraq - Kurdistan - should have its own development."
"Regarding the energy memorandum of understanding, this is very important, but Iraq is not a unitary state."
"So is the memorandum also being discussed with the Kurdish autonomous government?"
"Because there is a discussion in progress on Kirkuk, on who owns the oil fields, etc. Is this being taken into consideration?"
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the Iraqi security forces are still not well-trained, and are still not functioning well."
"So we should not only support the rule of law but, if asked, we should also be prepared to help them by assisting their security forces. There needs to be an integrated approach concerning energy, the economy and stability."
"There needs to be an integrated approach concerning the states neighbouring Iraq."
"Please would you give a clue about that integrated approach?"
"Thank you on behalf of the ALDE Group."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, can I thank the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, for her statement."
"I do think it is relevant to mention that the debate we are having tonight is taking place against the backdrop of the Chilcot inquiry in the UK into the illegal war on Iraq and what lessons should be learned from that, and a lot of information is coming to light which confirms what many of us believed at the time of the invasion: that the reason for the war was regime change and control of resources and not the threat of weapons of mass destruction."
"And, in terms of long-term planning for a post-war Iraq, words like 'dire', 'deeply flawed' and 'woefully thin' are being used by senior diplomats and military officers in their evidence to the inquiry, so it is little wonder that we are now seeing severe consequences of the action."
"Baroness Ashton said that some progress has been made, and of course it has, but there are severe problems still."
"There is no legislation to protect minorities in Iraq."
"There is a continuing major refugee problem."
"Trade unionists, journalists, women politicians and human rights activists have disappeared or have been killed."
"Suicide attacks continue."
"With elections due on 7 March, the Iraqi Election Commission last week, as my colleague mentioned, barred almost 500 candidates, mainly Sunni politicians, from standing."
"They are already under-represented in the Iraqi Parliament and this is certain to lead to more tension and instability."
"Last November, the EU Presidency urged the government of Iraq to suspend the death penalty and abolish it altogether, but 900 people are still on death row in Iraq and death sentences are handed out often following unfair trials, some lasting only a few minutes."
"The EU has a responsibility to help build democracy and ensure respect for human rights, and the framework for engagement with Iraq sets out three priorities to help build basic services like health and education, to enhance the rule of law and to support the Human Rights Commission."
"The partnership and cooperation agreement will be the basis for future work, but we must demand immediate action on issues like the abolition of the death penalty, on protecting vulnerable and targeted groups and on strengthening democracy and human rights."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the elections will not be free and fair in Iraq."
"Ten days ago, the Justice and Accountability Commission decided to ban Saleh al-Mutlaq, leader of the parliamentary National Dialogue Front and a member of the Iraqi Parliament for the past four years."
"He has been banned from participating in the forthcoming elections."
"I think it was no coincidence that this outrageous ban, together with the banning of over 500 further secular Iraqi politicians, was announced on the very day Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's odious Foreign Minister, was visiting Baghdad."
"Saleh al-Mutlaq has been an outspoken critic of Iranian meddling in Iraq, and now the mullahs have insisted on his removal from the election."
"I am relieved that US Vice-President, Joe Biden, has already protested about this ban, and I hope, Baroness Ashton, that you will do likewise."
"Unless Dr al-Mutlaq and the others are reinstated, we must not, and cannot, recognise the legitimacy of this election."
"Baroness Ashton, I am sorry but I do not share your optimism."
"It is good to be optimistic, but we cannot be optimistic about Iraq as things stand at the moment."
"As proof of this, the Commission has decided not to send observers because it cannot guarantee their safety."
"I believe this decision speaks for itself."
"It clearly shows that as far as Iraq is concerned - and I know that you do not want to talk about the past, but we have no option but to talk about the past - we are faced with a country that has been devastated, with more than 1 million people dead and 4 million homeless as a result of an illegal, unfair war based on lies."
"Neither were there any weapons of mass destruction nor any connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda."
"That is the plain truth of it."
"The only thing that was true was the interest of the North American oil industry in gaining control of crude oil in Iraq."
"That is the plain truth."
"Moreover, that truth cannot reasonably continue with the presence of the occupying forces, which is distorting everything."
"I would not be surprised, at the moment, if the decision that has been taken to ban the opposition parties were to result in a genuine civil confrontation."
"Some European embassies do not currently rule out the eventuality of a military coup, an actual military coup in Iraq."
"The picture is therefore very gloomy."
"I call on you to work quickly to withdraw the occupying forces as soon as possible."
"This is the factor that is distorting the true situation in Iraq."
"The United Nations should therefore assume control and allow a transition that will ensure a return to normality for something that should never have been forsaken, in other words, international law."
"Madam President, High Representative, on Christmas night, 2009 - while we were on our Christmas recess, in other words - a number of churches in Iraq, Mesopotamia, were closed."
"Threats of bombings led to this sad situation, just as they had last year."
"In any case, the churches often remain empty, with or without such threats, as more and more Christians are leaving the country."
"The violence against them just goes on increasing, despite their shrinking numbers."
"Before Christmas, there were three deadly attacks in Mosul."
"Moreover, the Christians in the previously relatively safe city of Kirkuk, too, have, for several months, faced a simply unrelenting series of kidnappings and killings, resulting in the flight of hundreds of Christian families."
"While there were around 1.5 million Christians in Iraq in 2003, more than half of them have now sought safety from religious cleansing in flight, religious cleansing that is being performed by Islamic extremists."
"Is the European Council, are the 27 Member States of the European Union, just watching on meekly as this Afghanisation of Iraq takes place, an Iraqi Christian has asked."
"I would appreciate hearing your position on this, High Representative."
"Whatever it may be, a Mesopotamia without its ancient Christian community will not face a more tolerant future, nor will that be good for Europe's security in the long term."
"(RO) The preparations for the legislative and presidential elections on 7 March have generated a frenzy of activity involving the formation of new coalitions and alliances."
"Some of the Iraqi Prime Minister's opponents want to re-establish old alliances, such as the Iraqi United Coalition."
"On the other hand, the prime minister is attempting to attract secular groups or independent candidates to join the Rule of Law Coalition."
"However, we must not forget that, after these legislative and presidential elections, the government will have to organise the referendum on Kirkuk."
"There is a strong possibility that the security situation in Iraq will deteriorate in the event that these elections are disputed by some Iraqi groups or in the case of internal conflicts."
"The main problems facing the authorities in Baghdad are the postponement of the referendum on the SOFA agreement signed with the United States and of the finalisation of the oil and gas law, the drop in oil price, the large number of executions - there are currently 900 people who have received the death sentence - and the use of torture to obtain confessions."
"The general deterioration in the human rights situation is causing the EU deep disquiet."
"Last but not least, there is the rise in the level of corruption."
"One example I would like to give you of this is the arrest of the former Iraqi trade minister."
"In terms of its relations with Iraq, Romania is aiming to switch from making a contribution to military security to the area of civilian security."
"My country has shown that it keeps its commitments to its partners by retaining its military presence in Iraq until the mission is accomplished."
"(PT) The democratic achievements of the Iraqi people still need to be consolidated and furthered, as does the security situation."
"In recent months, there has been an encouraging reconfiguration of alliances, which has done much to overcome the ethnic-religious splits that have marked Iraqi politics in recent years."
"The success of the new Kurdish 'Change' party is an example of the normalisation of political life in Iraq."
"However, the Election Commission's recent statement that around 500 Sunni politicians would be barred from standing is not conducive to national reconciliation, may jeopardise the electoral process and could reignite conflicts."
"The news about the application of the death penalty is also disheartening."
"Baroness Ashton, European leaders should strive to convince the Iraqi authorities to abolish it."
"The strengthening of the EULEX is also important in this regard."
"One and a half million Iraqis still live in neighbouring countries."
"Many will never be able to return."
"The European countries that participated in the invasion in 2003 have a particular responsibility, and should welcome more of these refugees."
"In this respect, as in the cases of support for internally displaced persons, human rights issues in general and women's rights in particular, and the fight against corruption, it is vital that the Iraqi Government rectifies the NGO law, so that society can organise itself freely."
"It is imperative that the European Union encourages interaction between Iraqi and European NGOs."
"A society that is civil, free and dynamic is a prerequisite for the consolidation of democracy in Iraq."
"(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, despite the huge commitment of international forces and hundreds of victims among the international coalition, including 23 Polish soldiers, the situation in Iraq is still bad."
"It is a country in which we have to deal with terrorist attacks and persecution of religious minorities, including the Christian minority, and, of course, in comparison with what the situation was like several years ago, some progress has been made."
"However, we still receive news of terrorist attacks which are destabilising not only Iraq but the whole of the Middle East."
"The objective of the terrorists and the sponsors of international terrorism is the destabilisation of Iraq."
"Much evidence points to the fact that Iran is responsible for sponsoring terrorism."
"What is your opinion, Mrs Ashton, as the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, concerning the role of Iran in interfering in the affairs of Iraq?"
"I would like to encourage you to adopt a more assertive stance and to cooperate with the United States in order to achieve solutions which will influence and put pressure on Iran to stop interfering in Iraq's internal affairs."
"In my opinion, only then will the possibility exist of bringing about a relative degree of stability in the region."
"(FR) Madam President, High Representative, we do not share your optimism either on the situation in Iraq or on the benefits of the Coalition, as it borders on blindness."
"Iraq was invaded and occupied on the basis of deliberately deceptive information concerning the presence of weapons of mass destruction."
"As a result, 17 of the 27 EU Member States were dragged into the attack and occupation of Iraq."
"The country lies in ruin, its heritage plundered, its population deeply divided."
"Religious fanaticism there is recruiting numerous reserves of fighters."
"Iranian tyranny intervenes there freely."
"Elections take place in a deplorable and unfair manner."
"What do you and what do we intend to do to call to account those countries which lied and which could start again tomorrow with Yemen or any other nation?"
"What measures do you intend to take to condemn the occupiers for resorting to non-conventional chemical and radiological weapons and depleted uranium shells, the consequences of which on future generations are well known?"
"How can we ensure that these arms will not be used in Afghanistan because we turned a blind eye to the situation in Iraq?"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we sincerely welcome the forthcoming elections in Iraq because they represent a further step towards democracy."
"They will not be free and fair, but we must settle for one small step after another."
"Rebuilding Iraq in economic, trade, cultural and financial terms, and guaranteeing its security, are essential conditions for the development of democracy, but we must also promote the strengthening of the country's institutions."
"The peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic and religious groups present in Iraq can be brought about through a renewal of the institutions, with the implementation of a federal formula - federalism - which allows broad autonomy for the various regions within the framework of a unitary State."
"The experience of Iraqi Kurdistan could be a useful reference point."
"I would therefore like to know the opinion of Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, on this institutional aspect of the country."
"(SV) Naturally, there is a lot of talk of violence and terrible horrors when Iraq is discussed, but it is indisputable that a democratisation process is taking place in the country."
"I would like to remind you that 3 912 women stood quite openly in the local elections in Iraq last year."
"That is roughly ten women standing for each seat."
"That must be seen as a positive thing, particularly in an Arab country."
"It also provided us with some hope ahead of this year's parliamentary elections on 7 March, particularly since the Sunnis participated in the local elections."
"As has already been stated, however, two weeks ago, a government commission refused 14 Sunni parties and several hundreds of people permission to participate in the elections."
"Among those affected are defence minister Abdul-Qadir al-Obaidi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of the Sunni-led Iraqi Front for National Dialogue."
"The Iraqi parliamentary elections are, of course, crucial to the future of the country and for the future democratisation of Iraq, particularly as regards Iraq's ethnic and religious cohesion."
"I would also like to underline that we must speak plainly as regards the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq."
"As I mentioned, the Iraqi parliamentary elections will be decisive for how we regard Iraq in the immediate future."
"What does the EU's High Representative, Baroness Ashton, believe that the EU can do to make the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Iraq inclusive and more democratic?"
"(LT) In recent years, the European Union has greatly strengthened its relations and influence in the countries of the Near East."
"The European Union has always paid much attention to Iraq and, together with the international community, has participated both in the reconstruction of Iraq and in peacekeeping and security missions."
"Different groups are still struggling for power in the country, which hinders the implementation of reforms begun in the country in various areas."
"The fact that 14 parties are banned from participating in the elections that are taking place is also cause for concern."
"Iraq has chosen the road to democracy and therefore, both the European Union and other states must demand and, if necessary, help ensure that the international commitments entered into are observed and human rights and freedoms are respected."
"I believe that Iraq really is ready for close cooperation with the European Union."
"The Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and Iraq in the area of energy cooperation which was signed on Monday demonstrates its commitment to develop a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial."
"From an energy point of view, Iraq is very important to the European Union, but safeguarding security of energy supply is inevitably linked to economic and political stability in the country, which has been lacking in recent times."
"Clearly, this is a long-term process, but I believe that the European Union, the High Representative and the international community must offer means and solutions to make the principles of human rights and the rule of law become the fundamental pillars of future politics in Iraq."
"(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to say that if I wanted to summarise Mrs Ashton's speech in one sentence, I would say it was official optimism."
"However, I think Europe and our voters expect something more specific, and they expect the truth."
"Politicians show who they are not only by what they say, but also by what they do not say, and I did not hear in your speech, Mrs Ashton, anything about some matters which have shocked a significant part of European public opinion, including public opinion in my country."
"I am thinking, for example, of the regular persecution of minorities in Iraq, including, and I stress this, of Christians."
"This is a reality of which we can be certain."
"I think my colleague, Mr Poręba, was right in what he said a moment ago about Iranian interference in Iraq."
"Is the same not true of the Iraqi authorities and their scandalous intervention in Camp Ashraf, which houses Iranian refugees?"
"Are the Iraqi authorities not doing just this?"
"It seems to me this should be stressed very strongly, especially because the Iraqi authorities are receiving financial aid from the European Union, which they then often use in a highly improper way, for example, in the intervention in Camp Ashraf."
"(PL) Madam President, I think Iraq can serve as an example of how sometimes, to break the back of a dictatorship which destroys its opponents in their thousands using chemical weapons, it is necessary to use force."
"These decisions are difficult."
"Therefore, I would like us, today, while speaking about Iraq, to remember the thousands of soldiers from the United States, Italy, Poland and other countries who have fallen in Iraq, and to remember their families."
"They went there believing they were going to serve in a good cause, and, as we are hearing here, Iraq is, today, on the way to building a democracy."
"I know that, today, we are all calling for you to be more active, Mrs Ashton, but we want the European Union to be active."
"Please go to Iraq and present an evaluation of the situation, so that the aid which the European Union is sending will be used with the same conditions attached as have been mentioned here and, in particular, with regard to the protection of minorities."
"(PL) Madam President, it so happens that only Poles are speaking at the moment, but we do have experience of the involvement of Poland and Polish soldiers in restoring security in Iraq."
"I share your opinion, Mrs Ashton, that, fortunately, the situation in Iraq is a little better than it was, but it is still in a rather fragile state."
"Alongside the diverse measures which the Union is taking, I would like to propose two specific measures, because it seems to me they are missing."
"The first matter concerns something which has not been mentioned today: I think it is exceedingly important for the development and stabilisation of Iraq to adopt a programme for the education of young Iraqis in Europe, because in Iraq, there is still a shortage of doctors, engineers and irrigation specialists."
"I think we could help Iraq greatly in this area."
"The second matter concerns protection of the cultural treasures which are to be found in Iraq."
"I think the EU should, in particular, help with the rebuilding of Babylon."
"This is a treasure which everyone in the world should take care to protect."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, my question relates to the memorandum of understanding that has been signed in the energy sector."
"Do you think it is possible to achieve further development together with either Mr Oettinger or Mr De Gucht?"
"In my opinion, economic reconstruction would be the very thing to bring more stability to Iraq."
"If we were to improve relations in the energy sector, particularly through greater provision of European equipment to make better use of the energy reserves that are present there, with us buying energy there to compensate, we would have a win-win situation for both sides."
"An initiative in the next few weeks would make great sense in this regard."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission. - Thank you all again for an important and interesting debate."
"I will just try and capture some of the clear issues that honourable Members were most concerned about."
"I would begin by recognising the importance that Members attach to the issue of minorities."
"As Members will know, one of the fundamental parts of our work in the partnership and cooperation agreements is indeed to make sure that human rights is at the heart of our agreements."
"We hope to be able to initial this agreement with Iraq soon, and I do accept and undertake to make sure that, within what we do, the issues of minorities are understood."
"That is clearly of great significance."
"I share, too, the objective raised by a number of honourable Members on the question of capital punishment."
"Our objective is indeed to get this abolished, for all the reasons that honourable Members have quite rightly indicated."
"I agree, too, that we have to consolidate and strengthen the political processes, which is going to be of great significance in everything we do, and to make sure particularly that we have, with the forthcoming elections, an understanding of what it is we want to achieve."
"I understand the points raised by a number of honourable Members, including Mr Costa and Mr Stevenson, about the issues concerning the Committee decision on the barring of candidates."
"The review of candidates was always part of the pre-electoral process."
"There is an appeals procedure, which I trust will be allowed to run its proper course."
"I should also say that we do plan to send our EU mission next week, which is six weeks ahead of election day, and that will enable us to follow first-hand and closely the pre-election process, which is of great interest."
"We trust and hope that the Iraqi authorities will ensure an inclusive electoral process, for all the reasons that honourable Members have made absolutely clear in what they have said."
"A number of Members also raised the issue of the memorandum of understanding on energy and its importance and significance."
"We are very clear in doing this that Iraq is a unitary state and that all our cooperation is with the government of all of Iraq."
"We fully support Iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state."
"Within this area, it will be important to enhance cooperation - and I heard what was said, in particular, by Mr Rübig, who described the need to think further about enhancing that cooperation."
"I will feed that back to the Commissioners-designate."
"I am also aware, when I say that there is an issue around the security question, that the issue of Kirkuk is a very important one, as well as other disputed boundaries."
"I described that as one of the major challenges which Iraq faces at the present time."
"I feel very strongly that Iraq has to solve these issues for itself."
"It is for Iraq to deal with."
"However, I am very keen to support the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, which has made significant efforts to try and begin a dialogue and a process."
"To be cautious, though, I do not expect dialogue to be of any significant level pre the elections, at this particular stage."
"Just a little bit more about energy cooperation too."
"We see this as being part of developing a comprehensive and integrated energy policy for Iraq."
"This is about the supply and security of supply between Iraq and the European Union and should, of course, include the development of renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, and to also enhance energy efficiency measures within Iraq."
"I hope, too, that we will see technological, scientific and industrial cooperation as well over the coming months and years."
"That point was well made."
"Moving to the issue of the recent cancellation of the delegation, Mr Meyer raised the issue of future security concerns."
"We do want to see an improvement in the environment, as I have indicated, to allow the deployment of the election observation mission with the participation of MEPs."
"This will clearly be of enormous significance for honourable Members in the coming electoral process and, as I have indicated, we will be sending people out very shortly."
"Honourable Members raised the question of the withdrawal of forces."
"President Obama has, of course, announced the withdrawal of all combat troops by August 2010 which, in practice, means that the withdrawal will begin soon after the national elections."
"That, again, is of significance and importance."
"I have indicated that we are sending the election assessment team shortly, which I hope will help us deal with the issues that honourable Members have raised in that context."
"In terms of Camp Ashraf, we have consistently and repeatedly reminded Iraq that this complex issue must be managed in full accordance with international law, and indeed without any violence."
"Going back to where we began, I am optimistic about Iraq."
"There are significant challenges, and honourable Members are right to remind us of those significant challenges."
"However, we can see, with the coming elections and with the opportunity for greater cooperation - an opportunity for the European Union, with its value system and the things we are particularly concerned about: human rights, the rights of minorities, the issues of capital punishment, developing strong cooperation on energy security and supply and working more closely with the government, while being clear about the expectations we have - a future for Iraq that will be peaceful and democratic."
"We must ensure that we work consistently towards that end."
"I know of only a few countries relatively close to Europe which have managed to put their 'democratisation' process off for several decades."
"Iraq, where units from EU countries have also unfortunately left a negative mark, is definitely one of them."
"At present, one of the most secular states in the Islamic world has been left in ruins, with three of its communities constantly at loggerheads."
"What has survived from the past are just memories of the country's relatively good education and health care systems, and a comparatively advanced infrastructure."
"This is the only country in the region where the Kurdish minority was autonomous, even though no ideal democratic regime ruled in the country."
"By and large, the question is which country of the region can we describe as having a truly democratic regime?"
"The fact that, following the invasion by the US Army, the Iraqi state has been totally disrupted marks, together with the partial liquidation of the infrastructure of its social, health care, and educational systems, a giant step backwards."
"The cloak of so-called democratic elections can by no means cover that up."
"The ongoing efforts aimed at distracting attention from current problems by stage-managed trials of prominent figures of Saddam Hussein's regime are naive."
"Only a person absolutely unacquainted with the situation could believe that it can be improved in this way."
"The only positive aspect of the recent period is that both the US administration and the Iraqi Government have realised that there will be no improvement without good relations with Iran."
"I am pleased at the optimistic tone of Mrs Ashton's speech, but I would rather maintain a certain caution in my assessment of the situation in Iraq."
"Despite many appearances, the country is still internally unstable, and democracy most certainly cannot be said to have 'taken root'."
"We cannot speak of stabilisation in a country within whose borders 1.8-1.9 million residents have been displaced, while a further million have left the country altogether, and the conditions under which the refugees are living are extremely poor."
"It is essential to review the methods currently being used to supply foreign aid to refugees in Syria and Jordan and displaced people inside Iraq."
"This aid needs to be supplied for a sufficiently long period of time."
"How long?"
"This we still do not know."
"However, just as a doctor does not stop treatment at the first signs of improvement, we, too, must not allow ourselves to be misled by over-optimistic prognoses."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership agreement (Cotonou agreement) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (Cotonou Agreement)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face: the economic and financial crisis, the social or food crisis, climate change, energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty."
"The dominant economic model that is the unbridled free market, and our lifestyles, have not just shown their limitations, but have actually caused these unprecedented multidimensional crises."
"We must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies."
"The report submitted to you today and adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Development seems to me to represent a first step towards this necessary revision."
"The main imperative to respect is consistency."
"European Union trade policy, fisheries and agriculture must be designed consistently and in such a way as to ensure sustainable development, to fight poverty and guarantee a decent standard of living and income for everyone."
"I am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today."
"By making trade an end in itself, and not a means to serve its development policy, the European Union is sacrificing the populations of developing countries for the benefit of its multinationals."
"Therefore, negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements are quite rightly causing controversy amongst the governments of the ACP, unions and civil society, which see them as a threat to their economies."
"Agriculture is one of the most problematic issues and remains tragically neglected in cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"Although rural areas and this sector represent more than 60% of the population and their jobs, their share of the European funds for ACP countries is virtually non-existent."
"This must change."
"How can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority?"
"Agriculture must be at the heart of the European Union's development policies."
"Helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries' governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007."
"China, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar now own thousands of hectares in developing countries."
"The European Union and the ACP countries must tackle this matter, which is likely to create violent conflicts and hunger riots, in particular, by making access to natural resources such as land and water a fundamental and inalienable right of local populations."
"Another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax havens."
"The repercussions of these are bad enough for developed countries, but are even worse for the economies and the political institutions of developing countries."
"The illicit financial flows that they allow are thought to account for as much as ten times the amount of official development assistance."
"Stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility."
"A first step could be the signing of a binding agreement, requiring multinationals to automatically declare their profits and the taxes paid in every country in which they operate, thus limiting the abuses and the losses sustained by developing countries."
"Finally, I would like to use this debate to stress once more the democratic deficit of this revision, which our parliaments were not consulted on."
"The role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly must, however, be strengthened."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the negotiators will seize the opportunity they are being given to make the necessary amendments to this partnership and to make it a success of which the principal beneficiaries will be the populations of the ACP countries."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on International Trade, over which I have the honour of presiding, has decided to take a stand on the ongoing revision of the Cotonou Agreement for two reasons."
"Firstly, trade is an essential part of the relations between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the European Union."
"Secondly, the Cotonou Agreement has brought with it the new Economic Partnership Agreements, which are essentially trade agreements."
"For these reasons, we have decided to participate by providing a report, for which I am the rapporteur."
"In this report, we are concerned with two things: firstly, respecting the details of the Economic Partnership Agreements and the parliamentary monitoring institutions which they have established, such as the Cariforum, and, secondly, making use of synergies while respecting the autonomy of both institutions."
"Respecting the synergies, in other words, within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which acts between the European Union and the ACP countries and the new inter-parliamentary institutions for the Economic Partnership Agreements."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I appreciate very much the interest that you take in the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"It is also with great interest that I read the report of the Development Committee, which provides a shrewd analysis on the matters at stake."
"Throughout the whole process, it is a priority for us to keep Parliament informed, as we have done over the last months."
"The negotiations have gained momentum and are now entering into the final phase, and the next joint ambassadorial meeting will prove the value of these discussions."
"We will be heading for an extraordinary joint ministerial meeting to conclude the negotiations in March, as foreseen by the Cotonou Agreement."
"Let me now share with you some observations on the report."
"Above all, the report has already proven helpful in upholding certain positions of the EU."
"Just to name some of them: your position on strengthening national ACP parliaments, on the International Criminal Court and on other human rights issues confirmed our negotiation position."
"Likewise, the importance that you attach to climate change and food security is shared by us and will be reflected in the final outcome."
"I would like to focus on four items, starting with the importance of the parliamentary dimension as embodied in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to which the report attaches great importance."
"The Commission is committed to strengthening the parliamentary dimension in the Cotonou Agreement."
"Therefore, our intention is not to weaken the JPA."
"On the contrary, the Commission proposal must be seen in the broader context of growing parliamentary oversight functions, in particular, with a view to existing and future Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and EDF programmes."
"We should ensure maximum synergy between EPA and Cotonou institutions, including between regional JPA meetings and the EPA parliamentary bodies."
"In this emerging setting, a reduction in plenary JPA meetings would make sense."
"The Commission accepts, however, that this matter needs to be agreed with those who are most concerned, and is therefore open to reconsidering its position."
"At the same time, we would be interested to learn more from Parliament how it sees the JPA's role and functioning in a changing political and institutional environment."
"The establishment of EPAs does not only call for the need to ensure synergy between them and the Cotonou institutions, but also requires an update of the Cotonou trade provisions, since the Cotonou trade regime has become obsolete."
"We have agreed with ACP partners that we will continue the negotiations towards regional European Partnership Agreements."
"In this context, as Development Commissioner, I would stress that it is neither politically desirable nor legally feasible to incorporate EU unilateral trade regimes such as GSP or GSP+ in Cotonou, as suggested in the draft report, since these depend on autonomous EU schemes."
"By contrast, the Commission welcomes the call for Cotonou to give more attention to the trade and development issues in general, and to aid for trade in particular."
"In your report, you express the concern that the conclusion of EPAs and increased regionalisation might undermine the coherence of the ACP Group."
"The Commission believes that regional differentiation within the framework of Cotonou is more an opportunity than a threat."
"Regional integration is crucial for the development of ACP countries and we need to integrate this reality into Cotonou to better support their own efforts towards this objective."
"This by no means signifies disrupting the ACP Group, and our ACP partners largely share this approach."
"Let me now briefly comment on sectoral policies which you are stressing in your report."
"We fully share the importance of climate change and renewable energies which are already included in the present revision exercise."
"Likewise, we will address food security in the regional dimension."
"You also stress the importance of good governance in tax matters and in the fiscal area."
"Good governance is a fundamental principle of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Building on Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is currently preparing a new policy on good governance in tax matters in the context of development cooperation."
"We are also seeking to address these aspects in the ongoing revision exercise."
"Therefore, I can confirm that we share the same objective with you, which is to create fair, effective and growth-enhancing tax systems and effective tax administrations, as well as to strengthen the participation of developing countries in international tax processes."
"Finally, I take note that you deplore that the Commission has not consulted a wider variety of actors before launching the revision process - paragraphs 2 and 8 - and I fully agree that, for the future of the ACP-EU relations post-2020, a comprehensive consultation process is needed, possibly in the form of a green paper."
"We will have to assess the results of the present revision exercise as a basis for this as a form of lessons learnt."
"I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Joly for compiling this report."
"The subject areas touched on in it are extremely important in terms of ensuring that the Cotonou Agreement remains the basis for a solid partnership with the ACP countries, as well as a relevant instrument against the backdrop of the new challenges which these countries are facing."
"The negotiations are taking place in a climate which, as we all know, is difficult and complex."
"On the one hand, the ACP countries are deeply affected not only by the economic and financial crisis, but also by the lack of food security and the consequences of climate change."
"On the other hand, there is an institutional challenge facing all the parties in the negotiations, which involves reflecting in an appropriate manner on the trends towards a regionalisation of relations between ACP countries and the European Union."
"We must ensure from now on that the revised text contains all the elements required for a cooperation promoting effective development, capable of contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in the ACP countries."
"I also wish to emphasise that I introduced five amendments on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I believe that these will offer a more finely nuanced reading of some of the proposals contained in the report."
"For example, it is important in paragraph 29 for us to insist on the concept of ownership in connection with arable land."
"In addition, on the subject of creating a mechanism where transnational companies are obliged to declare the profits they have made, I believe that this must be set up at international level."
"In paragraph 25, it is important to make a clear reference to dealing with the issue of food security in a consistent manner as part of the EU's development policy."
"Finally, in paragraph 31, the position expressed on readmission agreements with third countries does not reflect the PPE Group's vision on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her work, on the report and also on taking into account the contributions of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and, although we have again tabled some amendments, we see our contribution in the resolution that she has presented."
"For our group, the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries is part of an historic commitment, which must retain all its specific characteristics, which must not be watered down, even by the need to comply with certain rules, such as those of the WTO."
"We are most concerned that this partnership should preserve, in particular, the consistency of all European Union policies - trade policy, budgetary policy - with objectives in the area of development, but also in relation to the promotion of peace, security and democracy and human rights in ACP countries."
"It is not a question of imposing a model, but of working with these countries to ensure their development, which must be sustainable development."
"From this point of view, it is very important for this revision to enable us to take into account new elements of the last five years: the fight against climate change, technology transfers, renewable energy development aid, the fight against food crises, and therefore greater emphasis in our cooperation on agriculture, on food sovereignty, the fight against financial deregulation, good fiscal governance and the fight against tax havens."
"We see our contribution in all of that."
"I would like to stress two points."
"Trade: with the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements, certain provisions of the Cotonou Agreement will become obsolete, but we are concerned that this agreement should still mention that the trade clauses and the trade regimes from which the ACP countries benefit must not be less favourable than those from which they benefited previously."
"It seems to us that we should integrate the GSP, the interim EPAs and all these provisions in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Finally, on emigration - our colleagues in the group will emphasise this - we are concerned that it should actually be said that the migration agreements preserve the rights of migrants and that we cannot accept transit regimes to countries that do not guarantee respect for human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Joly on the accuracy and the rigour of her report, and on the very appropriate analysis that it contains."
"The second revision of the Cotonou Agreement must enhance the Lomé acquis while consolidating unity, cohesion and solidarity between the ACP States."
"This agreement must, of course, guarantee that these countries will be able to take control of their development policy."
"The programming, re-examination and monitoring of the agreement should consequently also be a prerogative for the parliaments of our partner countries."
"I know that this is obviously a huge challenge, but I think that we must make a special effort to encourage these parliaments."
"It is an expectation that we must also express very openly to the authorities of our partner countries."
"Certain governments, as you know, are reluctant to encourage parliamentary debate in their countries."
"I also call in particular for the democratic scrutiny and the role of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be strengthened, notably via the insertion in the Cotonou Agreement of clauses that would allow the JPA to receive national and regional strategy documents in order to debate them."
"In future, the national and regional parliaments must also, I believe, be consulted much more systematically on the process of drafting regional and national strategy documents."
"I would like to say a few words on the organisation of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly: I believe that we must keep two sessions."
"Reducing these to one session would send out an extremely negative message to our partners."
"Regional meetings should perhaps be organised more closely together; on 25 January, I will make some concrete proposals in this regard to the Bureau of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"For the sake of consistency and effectiveness, I insist that the parliamentary bodies in charge of monitoring the EPAs are made up of members of the JPA in order to better guarantee their development dimension."
"Furthermore, I welcome your comments, Commissioner, since you were quite clear on this declaration as the next Trade Commissioner."
"I do not, for one minute, doubt your sincerity when you say that you want to endow these Economic Partnership Agreements with this development dimension."
"Finally, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement should provide for an increase in aid and funding for ACP countries in order to help them take the measures necessary to combat climate change."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, we go on and on and on."
"We keep talking about alleviating poverty."
"This is the 10th EDF."
"We have pumped about EUR 350 billion into so-called alleviating poverty when we know that poverty has increased."
"Why is it that we have policies and programmes in our ACP countries that we never had in our own European history?"
"The provinces of Brussels or Brabant did not get richer and eliminate poverty by creating what we are trying to do in the ACP countries."
"We created wealth in Europe by creating wealth."
"How do we create wealth in the ACP countries?"
"Mrs Joly has very interestingly identified that there is a flight of capital."
"She says that eight times what we put into those countries goes out."
"Why is that capital not employed in those countries?"
"Why are we not creating the conditions for that capital to stay at home to create jobs and make wealth?"
"Until we answer these questions, we are wasting our taxpayers' money without actually eliminating one person from being poor."
"Mr President, my group supports Mrs Joly's report."
"We call for the following problems, amongst others, to be taken into consideration: the incorporation of the consequences of climate change and of the necessary adaptation measures for the ACP countries; the concern of the ACP countries that the EU's regional negotiations with groups of ACP countries will undermine solidarity within the ACP community; and the possibility of supporting necessary investments in the field of public services and public infrastructure with IB credits on the basis of the Cotonou Agreement."
"At the same time, we oppose the inclusion of quotas for the return of migrants from the EU to the ACP countries as part of these negotiations."
"The first revision of the Cotonou Agreement took up the political dimension."
"Now, it is about the parliamentary dimension, for which reason we see the idea of cutting the sittings of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to once a year as incomprehensible."
"(HU) I was shocked when, during a food conference, I saw a sign in the hand of the African delegation saying: Do not feed Africa."
"We would do better to realise that what Africa needs is not aid but food self-determination."
"Interestingly, the African population and farmers have the same interest as Eastern Europe's post-communist farmers and population, or even, carried to the extreme, the French farmers and population, namely the need for local farmers to decide what they wish to produce, how to produce it and sell it on the local marketplace."
"And the local population's interest is to be able to eat locally produced healthy and good quality food."
"The ideas of a liberalised global free market, on the one hand, and food self-determination, on the other, belong to two different systems of logic."
"Here, we should take the side of food self-determination more decisively."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement comes at a very interesting time, because it allows analysis of the provisions of the agreement in the light of a rapidly changing reality."
"Much has happened since the previous review in 2005: crises in the areas of economics, food, energy and finance and the changes resulting from climate negotiations and their effects on developing countries."
"However, something which must interest MEPs is the role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and possible attempts at restricting its frequency and role."
"I am greatly pleased by the Commissioner's declaration that the European Commission has no such intentions."
"This is important, because neither the European Parliament, nor the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, nor the parliaments of the ACP countries, took part in the decision process which has produced the changes to the agreement."
"Another important matter is the regionalisation of European Union-ACP relations and, in particular, the nature of this regionalisation."
"I am not against regionalisation, but I am convinced that regional meetings of the Joint Assembly must not replace plenary sessions."
"Incidentally, it would probably be more natural if decisions about the structures and principles of work of the Joint Assembly were made by the Assembly itself, and not the parties to the agreement."
"I endorse the desire expressed in the report to strengthen national parliaments."
"Mr Michel spoke about this."
"In future, we would like all representatives of the ACP countries who take part in the work of the Joint Assembly to be Members of their own parliaments, and not representatives of their governments."
"It is equally important that the national parliaments of the ACP countries be given the opportunity to play a significant role in cooperation on development, in preparation and implementation of programmes and in monitoring and evaluation of action taken."
"This explains the necessity of access to strategic documents."
"In addition, I agree, of course, that functions should not be duplicated and that complementarity and synergy between Economic Partnership Agreements and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is very important."
"(FR) Mr President, Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement has not been revised since 2000."
"It concerns a sensitive subject: the dialogue between the European Union and the ACP countries on immigration, fair treatment of immigrants, the principles of non-refoulement, the underlying causes of immigration and, finally, the fight against illegal immigration and readmission, and it is these two aspects that the European Union has mostly concentrated on."
"The cruel absence of a common immigration policy that is worthy of the values that Europe claims to uphold risks strengthening, in the planned revision of Article 13, the aspect of repression and the hunting down of illegal immigrants."
"The tragic example of the bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya, which has led to intolerable humanitarian situations, does not seem to have discouraged the zeal of those who want to toughen up Article 13 in order to strengthen the section on the fight against illegal immigration."
"Furthermore, in some regions - I am thinking of Calabria - illegal immigrants are now being hunted down openly and unceremoniously."
"Instead of acting on the basis of the fears aroused by the current crisis, we must point out the synergy that must be established between immigration and development."
"If the ACP countries need aid in order to take off economically, we ourselves will need immigration to face the crisis affecting us."
"We should therefore concentrate on legal immigration and mobility."
"These are the only safeguards against the hateful climate surreptitiously taking root in our own countries."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as liberal democrats, we want to take advantage of the revision of the Cotonou Agreement to affirm an idea of modernity that is backed by the ACP countries too, and when I speak of modernity I mean, above all, the assertion of policies that can stress and allow greater freedom."
"This freedom should be, first and foremost, freedom from bureaucracy, which is becoming more and more excessive in the ACP countries and is constantly an obstacle to economic growth."
"This freedom should be the possibility, above all, for students to go to study abroad, and I believe that we should take the opportunity afforded by this revision to launch an ambitious programme of study grants."
"This freedom should be through the dissemination of new IT technologies so that the Internet, in particular, can become an asset that is as widely accessible as possible."
"Finally, it should allow the free movement of workers in such a way as to resolve the serious cases of interference to which Mrs De Keyser referred when she talked about bilateral treaties."
"Cotonou, which is the direct descendant of Lomé and Yaoundé, has a long history; at one time, it led the way, and if it is able to tackle new challenges, it will again succeed in playing a major role."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Joly on the quality of her report."
"Indeed, the revision of the Cotonou Agreement must be an opportunity to finally take stock and to propose, on the basis of the lessons learned, solutions to improve its implementation, its operation and its impact."
"In this regard, the clear identification of priorities is extremely important."
"I would like to stress three points."
"First of all, we need to make the contents of the political dialogue clearer."
"We must not lose sight of the consolidation of peace, the prevention and the settling of conflicts, but making existing instruments operational and adding references to the fight against the traffic in small arms and against drugs are challenges which, once conquered, will have a positive impact politically, economically and socially."
"Secondly, the conclusion of flexible and balanced Economic Partnership Agreements that have due regard for regional development is extremely important."
"The key sectors, such as agriculture, renewable energy and the employment of young people, should be better taken into account."
"Regular dialogue with local populations will enable a realistic adjustment to be made."
"Finally, the institutional framework is vital."
"To ensure better cohesion between the different pillars of the agreement is absolutely essential."
"Strengthening the power of the JPA and of the national parliaments will automatically lead to better democratic scrutiny and, above all, to far greater transparency."
"To conclude, any instrument, whether new or overhauled, must preserve the fundamental principles and spirit of the agreement and, above all, we must not lose sight of the central objective, which is the eradication of poverty, while contributing to sustainable development and the progressive integration of the ACP countries into the global economy."
"Mr President, brevity is the source of wit."
"Congratulations, Madame Joly; congratulations, Commissioner."
"Parliament puts at its heart in these negotiations reinforcing the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses, inter alia, with regard to discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, and towards people living with AIDS and HIV."
"I am told, Commissioner, that some Member States do not want this amendment, but for Parliament it is vital."
"Human rights, as you well know, are often far too eroded, and this erosion is primarily for party political advantage."
"The defence of fundamental rights is at the heart of the European Union, and so it should therefore be at the heart and the centre of our relations with all ACP countries."
"Commissioner, this is probably the last time you will appear before us in your present portfolio, so can I please say a warm thank you on behalf of Parliament."
"You have been a staunch defender of human rights and the values of the EU, and I wish you well in your new portfolio. Thank you."
"(PT) This revised version of the Cotonou Agreement introduces key issues for sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the global economy."
"Issues such as climate change, energy security, training and education are essential for development in these countries."
"At the same time, global warming may present an opportunity."
"The costs of renewable energy that these countries have at their disposal are essential for their economic and social development, and allow them to move towards a state of independence in terms of energy, so that they can face up to the global crisis."
"Investment in education and training is equally important in combating poverty, unemployment, emigration and the brain drain, and will help to build the economy in these countries."
"To conclude, I would like to make special mention of the small island countries that are particularly vulnerable and fragile."
"In view of this, the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement should take account of the Mauritius Strategy and the Barbados Action Plan, which identify a number of measures to assist developing island countries in bringing about sustainable development."
"(PT) Mr President, Parliament has been convened at this precise moment in order to decide on the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Please allow me, however, to point out the difficulties that Haiti is facing at present."
"This situation calls for international solidarity, action and attention."
"Of course, my thoughts go out to those who have lost their lives and those who are living through a really desperate situation."
"In terms of the topic in question here, we know that Cotonou aims to create a framework for cooperation that will constitute a joint ACP-EU response to globalisation, contribute to peace and security, and foster a democratic political atmosphere."
"The 2005 revision took a few steps in the right direction."
"However, much remains to be done."
"The global economic and financial crisis, climate issues and the increased cost of food and energy are the reasons behind a new revised version."
"I will no longer vote for the European Union to maintain - and, wherever possible, to increase - the levels of aid given to ACP countries."
"I agree with the argument that the national parliaments of those countries need to be involved in the process of revising the agreement both now and in the future, and I reiterate the need for them to be invited to do so."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one objective that the second revision of the partnership agreement should have is definitely to promote a culture of responsibility."
"It will be very difficult to achieve this without the help of civil society organisations, non-State entities, and also without the parliaments."
"In fact, I do not believe that it is possible to have policies that fully meet the real needs of the communities involved."
"A second key aspect is humanitarian aid."
"The USD 300 billion of aid that has been granted over the past 40 years has had no effect, if we consider that the growth of the African continent over that period has been less than 0.2% per year."
"This is an apocalyptic scenario which the international community must start to understand."
"It must, at last, tackle the issue of developing countries as a problem that is truly ours, as a problem that concerns us, the day-to-day lives of our communities, to be tackled day by day together with the local institutions which are on an endless quest for a glimmer of legitimacy."
"Finally, allow me to stress that investing in human capital means trying to understand that the greatest resource for recovery is the very people who are living through difficult situations."
"It is they who bear the responsibility for pulling the continent out of the abyss, and it is for us to pay attention to the problems of those countries with a clear purpose: that common good which is an interest not only of the ACP countries but also our own, and the future of our citizens."
"We should look to people instead of to money, to substance instead of to advertisements."
"This will allow us to utilise our strategies to the best effect."
"(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have repeatedly criticised the fact that the national parliaments and the non-governmental organisations in developing countries are not involved in decision making regarding development aid, and that they do not have access to strategic documents."
"This must be rectified during the new revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The new agreement should also incorporate commitments by individual governments and parliaments to build functioning tax systems in their countries."
"This is important for both contracting parties."
"The ACP countries finally need their own standard fiscal administration, i.e., planned tax revenues for their own development objectives."
"This, in turn, will help the Union in its struggle against the abuse of tax havens, against tax evasion, and against the illegal flight of capital."
"As deputy chair responsible for human rights, I demand that international treaties also contain human rights clauses, and not only for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"I am sorry to note that the report by Mrs Joly, a good report in other respects, does not contain such a requirement."
"I urge the Commission and the Spanish Presidency to rectify this."
"(RO) The report we have debated today refers to many problems linked to food security in ACP countries."
"I believe that we cannot talk about this subject without also taking into account some of the realities of European agriculture."
"The European Union can and even should play the role of regulator on the global markets."
"If Europe reduced its agricultural output, the rise in food imports would contribute significantly to the global rise in food prices."
"This is why the European Union's food production must be maintained at constant levels for the benefit of Europeans, as well as for the benefit of the citizens from the ACP and other states."
"Therefore, I believe that these aspects linked to the poorer countries' food security are also closely linked to the future of the European common agricultural policy."
"(FR) Mr President, I would also like to express my support for the very good report by my colleague, Mrs Joly."
"The ACP-EU Partnership is more necessary than ever, and the tragedy taking place in Haiti demonstrates the extent to which the ACP-EU Partnership is indispensable and definitely must be strengthened."
"It is unusual to speak about all of this to a Commissioner who today is in charge of development but tomorrow will be in charge of trade and, precisely for this reason, I would like to give you three suggestions."
"Firstly, as others before me have said, when it comes to parliamentary control and the Assembly, we should continue to hold two annual meetings and not reduce these to one."
"Secondly, why not subject the Economic Partnership Agreements to parliamentary control in the case of the ACPs, rather than to a strictly commercial logic, so that, here too, parliaments can be involved and made responsible for controlling the repercussions for the populations of the Economic Partnership Agreements and the defence of their interests in this framework?"
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Cotonou agreements should promote a shift in the European Union's policy of cooperation and development aid."
"This policy should be aimed at genuine cooperation and solidarity, and should help to promote autonomous and sovereign development in ACP countries."
"There are myriad mechanisms that currently ensure that many of these countries remain subject to domination and subjugation."
"Suffocating foreign debt, paid several times over, yet always rising, plays a key role in establishing these kind of relations."
"Pressure from the European Union to implement Economic Partnership Agreements - essentially free trade agreements - has come to reflect the current priorities of the European Development Fund, which needs to be revisited, and is indicative of the path that is now being followed."
"This is a path that seeks to force these countries to submit to new relationships based on dependence and to the interests of multinationals, which leads to the overuse of their resources so as to serve interests that are not shared by their citizens."
"Development aid must not be conditional on the implementation of Economic Partnership Agreements."
"The concerns and objections of the ACP countries must be respected, along with the priorities that they set down."
"(DE) Mr President, I will come straight out and say this: I think there is little sense in paragraph 31 of the present proposal for a second revision of the agreement."
"I, too, am opposed to the kind of relay race that the various readmission agreements for migrants create, whereby the people in question are passed from one country to the next."
"In this regard, there is definitely a need for such cascade agreements to be better regulated at the international level."
"It seems to me even more important, however, that this kind of situation is avoided in the first place."
"I therefore believe that the idea of facilitating the circular visa for people from the ACP countries is the wrong way to go."
"Let us, therefore, support self-help."
"Let us promote self-sufficiency."
"Let us turn charity cases into producers with a sense of self-worth."
"That would certainly put a stop to social emigration and the flight from social poverty."
"(EL) Mr President, this afternoon, the debate was held on the massive and unimaginable disaster in Haiti and on how Europe can help to bring relief to the victims."
"This debate should remind us - and this is why I have taken the floor during this evening's sitting - that we need to approach agreements with countries which face serious economic problems and which are especially vulnerable to natural disasters, as the tragedy in Haiti has proven, in a completely different spirit from other economic agreements entered into by the European Union."
"We are talking about countries at the mercy of poverty, indigence and disease."
"We are talking about countries in which the term humanitarian crisis is tending to become the rule."
"It is therefore our responsibility, it is our duty, it is our creed, it is the foundation stone of the European Union for us to put human life above all else and any technical or economic dimensions after that."
"That is why, everything we have debated today, the red tape, the technical issues, need to be resolved as quickly as possible."
"(DE) Mr President, when I think of the Caribbean, two images come to mind: the current major disaster in Haiti, and, when you have been working in this House for many years, also the MEPs luxuriating at the meetings of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA)."
"After this long debate, in which important things have been said, it could perhaps be possible to send out a very concrete sign and, in consideration of the situation in Haiti, do without the next one or two opulent sittings of the ACP-EU JPA in these very countries and use the net profit to actually benefit the victims."
"It would only be a drop in the ocean, but it would be symbolic, and it would show that we really do mean, in practice, the many fine words that are spoken in this House."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ACP Assembly is particularly important at this political juncture where globalisation has more or less divided the world into countries producing products and countries producing ideas, giving rise to a migration of workers as well as, naturally, goods."
"At the heart of this process is the Mediterranean, the true fulcrum between Europe and the ACP countries."
"The Cotonou rules must therefore adapt to this new situation and I propose - at the request of the President of the Republic of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, who officially supports this proposal - that a decentralised office or a fixed annual meeting of the ACP Assembly be established in the most multi-ethnic, most Mediterranean European city, which is also close to the ACP countries: Naples."
"I therefore repeat - again at the request of the President of the Republic of Italy - I recommend discussing this proposal in the new agreements."
"Moreover, it has the advantage of bringing Europe closer to its citizens and the people of southern Italy, which is Europe's true logistical platform with regard to the countries of the Mediterranean."
"(PL) Mr President, I permit myself to ask for the floor after hearing Mr Niculescu's speech, and would like to support firmly the thought he expressed - that in our economic relations with other countries, including the ACP countries, we should not lose sight of the food security of European society."
"In relations with ACP countries, we can recall the reform of the sugar market, which was carried out under the noble slogan of support for those countries, but which, in reality, made the situation in the European Union, for our farmers and consumers, much worse, and was not of much help to the ACP countries."
"Let us always remember food security, and our society, which needs that security."
"Member of the Commission. - First of all, with respect to the GSP and GSP+, we have nothing in principle against these being included in the Cotonou Agreement, but we should realise that GSP and GSP+ are unilateral and Cotonou is contractual."
"I think it is therefore very difficult to put them in the Cotonou Agreement, but maybe we can find formulas that make the link more intricate."
"(FR) Democratic scrutiny: several speakers have requested that the practice of holding two annual plenary meetings be maintained."
"The Commission is prepared to reconsider its point of view in this respect, but perhaps we could nevertheless agree to let the regional meetings coincide, as far as possible, with one or two of the plenary meetings, since it seems to me that all the meetings of the European Parliament, together with those of the other institutions, create an awful lot of meetings."
"I therefore agree in principle with the idea of having two plenary meetings, but let us try to bring them closer to the regional meetings."
"Several speakers also spoke of the nature of the Economic Partnership Agreements."
"This is the term we agreed on, but in fact we should really talk in terms of development partnership agreements, and I think that this would also make the discussion with the ACP countries easier."
"I think that this would be liable to make the debate a little more open."
"In any case, if the European Parliament should agree at some point to a new Commission, of which I am a member, I will do everything possible, within my remit, to make these agreements a success and to be present at the sessions of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"There were some questions on fiscal matters."
"I think that I have already dealt with this point in my introduction, and I really believe that it is important that this becomes a crucial subject in our discussions with the ACP countries, but also among ourselves, since, let us be serious - and I know that the Spanish Presidency also has a keen interest in this subject - if we really want to do something, we also have to have the courage to intervene with our societies in these developing countries."
"The problem does not only arise there, the problem arises in particular, and I would even say above all, in the relationship between Europe and its own societies and industries in developing countries."
"This is a process that is under way and I understand that the Spanish Presidency will also take initiatives in this respect."
"Migration."
"With respect to Article 13, both sides want to update migration."
"On Article 13, the Commission has put forward a balanced and coherent proposal that builds on the three pillars of cooperation in the areas of migration and development, legal migration and illegal migration and readmission."
"The aspects put forward by the report are duly taken into account."
"All areas deserve equal attention."
"Negotiations are ongoing, and we are optimistic about finding an agreement provided the balance between the three pillars is kept."
"Mr Cashman made a remark with respect to discrimination."
"Mr Cashman is not here at the moment, but I think he is completely right."
"Sexual orientation was part of the elements proposed by the Commission and we attach a lot of importance to it, but you should also be aware, as the Commission is, that in some ACP countries, homosexuality is forbidden by law."
"We recently made representations to the Burundian President and also to the Ugandan President because they have introduced discriminatory laws, but this is a very touchy subject and I think, at a certain moment in time, you will have to come to grips with it."
"Either you insist that the text is very clear, and probably we will not get an agreement on it: that is the first possibility; or another possibility is perhaps that we have some language which is less specific."
"UN language is less specific but would also cover sexual orientation."
"That is something that should be further discussed in the course of the negotiations."
"I think I have reacted to most of the points, even if it meant that I have spoken for too long."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Cotonou agreements, poverty has not subsided."
"We have therefore failed in our development mission."
"Something has to change with this second revision."
"I am pleased to say that there is a fairly broad consensus on the measures that I am proposing, and I think that one of the measures that we can use to eradicate poverty is to really combat tax havens, and to use this instrument to do what we can."
"Within the European Union and in the ACP region, we can force multinationals to declare, on a country-by-country basis, how much they earn and how much tax they pay."
"That is also an international demand."
"However, many years will go by before this demand is met at international level."
"So let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in Europe."
"This is why I am asking you to reject the proposed amendment to paragraph 16, but to preserve the initial wording, which calls on us to put our own house in order."
"In the same vein, what we can do is also force our own investment bank to take action with regard to tax havens."
"We should prohibit European Development Fund investments in companies that do not make profits in the countries in which they operate, but prefer to make profits in tax havens."
"This was the case in Zambia, where very substantial investments - to the tune of USD 46 million, I believe - were made in the Mopani mine, for example."
"This has done nothing to improve the lives of Zambians; rather, it has improved the lives of the shareholders who have benefited from this aid."
"It is therefore totally counterproductive."
"This is within our power."
"We can change the mandate of our bank."
"Let us therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow."
"Let us take action in this regard."
"Then, there are principles to which we should remain totally committed: human rights and migrant rights, and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which, in reality, constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Wednesday, 20 January 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The second revision of the Cotonou Agreement presents an opportunity to evaluate the fields left open to incorrect or inefficient changes and is also the time when corrections can be made to the agreement according to developments in the globalisation process."
"There are numerous challenges to face, triggered by economic and social events, such as the economic and financial crisis and armed conflicts, as well as those posed by the negative trend in terms of the population's health, as highlighted by the increase in the number of people infected by transmissible diseases (TB, AIDS, malaria) and the rise in the number of victims of violence or natural disasters."
"There are also the challenges posed by climate change, which are more difficult to control, and all these challenges create the urgent need to make the developing countries' population more resistant to systemic social deficiencies."
"This also assumes that the offer of development cooperation is better focused on key elements in the public health and education systems."
"Consequently, I think that it is vital to deal with these aspects with greater clarity by consolidating title I - Development strategies - in Part 3 of the agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be voting in favour of this report, as I think that the deepening of cooperation between the European Union and the ACP states within the framework of the partnership agreements is important."
"That said, I would like to point out that this report contains the wording 'protection of sexual and reproductive health'."
"Yet what is behind this phrase?"
"Does it, first of all, mean ensuring people's physical and mental well-being in relation to all areas of human sexuality and reproduction, for example, by combating sexual violence and genital mutilation?"
"Does it, secondly, mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning?"
"Or, thirdly, does it also include abortion?"
"In the past, the Commission and the Council have made it clear in relation to questions from MEPs that this 'sexual and reproductive health' does not include abortion."
"That is exactly how I see it."
"I therefore think it important to establish that the term 'the sexual and reproductive health of women' is not in the context of abortion and I am therefore proposing a clarification to that effect in the text of the agreement."
"Today, the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement introduced in 2000 is in progress, and within the framework of this revision, the aim is to introduce a range of changes to the agreement, changes which will help us to achieve the objectives set out in the agreement: the abolition of poverty, economic development and the gradual integration of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States into the world economy."
"It should be noted that, since the latest revision to the Cotonou Agreement in 2005, there have been many new developments in the global situation (e.g. the financial crisis, climate change, rising food and energy prices, etc.), all of which directly affect the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"I totally agree with the rapporteur's opinion that all those developments in the global situation that have taken place could, if they are not dealt with appropriately in the process of revising the agreement, make it difficult to achieve the objective of the Cotonou Agreement and the Millennium Development Objectives by the year 2015."
"As is well known, the EU and ACP countries have today agreed on areas and articles that will be revised in the Cotonou Agreement, in which the above has also been partly taken into account."
"Unfortunately, this means, worryingly, that the European Parliament, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the parliaments of the Member States and the ACP countries have not been involved in the process of making the appropriate decisions, which crucially affects the transparency and credibility of the revision to the agreement."
"I am of the opinion that, in order to increase democratic legitimacy and self-accountability, the role of the European Parliament, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the parliaments of the EU Member States and the ACP countries should be increased in the process of revising the agreement."
"Procedural rights in criminal proceedings (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Council on procedural rights in criminal proceedings, by Sarah Ludford, Elena Oana Antonescu, Carmen Romero López, Heidi Hautala and Rui Tavares, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - B7-0343/2009),"
"the oral question to the Commission on procedural rights in criminal proceedings, by Sarah Ludford, Elena Oana Antonescu, Carmen Romero López, Heidi Hautala and Rui Tavares, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - B7-0344/2009)."
"author. - Mr President, I frankly and fully acknowledge that these two oral questions tabled on 1 December last year have been overtaken by events, but this debate is still worthwhile to acknowledge that the issue of procedural rights is fully back on the table after a regrettable absence of several years and to stress the urgency and priority of this programme."
"It has been a consistent complaint of the European Parliament for the last decade that procedural safeguards and defendants' rights have not received the same attention, let alone action, as moves to enhance the speed and efficiency of investigations and of prosecutions."
"We have supported the latter because, then, more criminals get caught."
"Those who reject in principle the European Arrest Warrant are the apologists for mafia criminals and absconding robbers, rapists and terrorists."
"But it is question of balance and getting 'European Arrest Warrant plus', and thus justice all round, through procedural guarantees to accompany simplified cross-border prosecutions."
"Opponents of the European Arrest Warrant of course do not want any EU action on rights either; they just want 'European Arrest Warrant minus'."
"But the application of the European Arrest Warrant without proper procedural guarantees has, in some cases, led to the denial of justice, because mutual recognition has not been accompanied by a solid basis for mutual trust."
"One of those cases is my own constituent Andrew Symeou."
"Andrew has been in prison in Greece for six months awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge which seems to be based on mistaken identity and, I am afraid to say, police brutality to witnesses, and I believe the European Arrest Warrant has been misused."
"When it was agreed upon in 2002, it was with the understanding from all sides that this measure, which would have the effect of EU citizens standing trial and being held in prison in another Member State, would be swiftly followed by measures guaranteeing their fair trial rights and guaranteeing there would be no miscarriages of justice."
"That promise was betrayed by Member States in failing to accept the Commission's 2004 proposal for a reasonably wide framework decision on procedural rights, and now a piecemeal approach is the best we can get."
"I am grateful that it was relaunched by the Swedish Presidency, but it is only a roadmap on a step-by-step basis."
"We need to see the glass is half full and be optimistic, although I regret that the Council is, worryingly, only promising to consider, not to legislate on, Euro-bail, which would have helped Andrew Symeou, who has been explicitly refused bail because he is a foreigner."
"Judges are currently asked to enforce the judgments and orders of courts in other Member States without examining the facts, and they will be subject to increasing criticism and public unease if there is no EU-wide compliance with minimal procedural safeguards and defence rights for criminal investigations and prosecutions."
"It is not just individual citizens who fear poor guarantees of rights; this also deters judges, but also police and prosecutors, from working together, too."
"I happen to believe that the human rights assurance in European Arrest Warrants should be an explicit condition of extradition, even if the Commission hates that."
"Thanks to Liberal Democrats, the UK legislation implementing the measure says that the court must be satisfied there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Puzzlingly, British courts seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender."
"Now if all Member States genuinely observed their obligations under the ECHR, there might be no need for EU measures."
"The problem is not the absence of standards but the absence of practical respect, and many Member States find themselves before the Strasbourg Court for this reason."
"Considering that the Treaty on European Union and now the TFEU obliges EU States to respect the ECHR, this is shameful and unacceptable."
"So we do need an EU mechanism for enforcement which, from now on, will be provided by Commission infringement competence and European Court of Justice supervision."
"So EU measures need both to be consistent with the ECHR and not conflict with or undermine it and, at the same time, to add value in the sense of strengthening practical implementation."
"I hope the Commission and Council agree that the standard of directives guaranteeing fundamental rights should be high."
"The Member State initiative on interpretation and translation, proposing the text which the Council agreed on last October, is less ambitious than the Commission text and needs improving."
"So we are concerned that the first measure does not demonstrate the highest standards."
"I hope we will be more ambitious and set a precedent for the next stages in building up procedural rights which, after interpretation and translation, are followed by other measures like legal advice, right to information, right to communicate with consular authorities and so on. Therefore, I want reassurance from the Council and Commission that measures in the roadmap will be rolled out fast enough to keep up the momentum towards a genuine achievement of fair trial rights, long overdue."
"I am pleased that this question has been tabled by Baroness Ludford, who spoke just now, Mrs Antonescu, Mrs Romero, Mrs Hautala and Mr Tavares, because we are indeed faced with a matter of overriding magnitude in the shape of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings."
"On this subject, I would like to say that we agree on raising the profile of the matter you have brought to our attention and we also agree that it should be harmonised at European level."
"In your question, you indicated at the outset that the Swedish Presidency made significant progress."
"The Swedish Presidency did indeed make important progress in this field."
"In October, the Council agreed on general guidelines for the text on the right to interpreting and translation in criminal proceedings and one month later, in November, the Council adopted a plan to make progress on further measures regarding procedural guarantees, in response to Baroness Ludford's call for action."
"Some of these you mentioned yourself, Baroness Ludford, such as the right to information on a person's rights - the repetition is intentional - and obligations in any criminal proceedings, on aid, on legal advice, on communication with family members and consular authorities, or on the special guarantees that must be put in place and the protection of vulnerable accused people."
"That was with regard to the Council during the Swedish Presidency."
"At this point you may well say: That is all very well, but is there any agreement with the European Parliament to continue treating this work as a priority?"
"And we can say to you: Yes, it is a priority to continue this approach."
"How?"
"Through what initiatives?"
"The first thing that the Spanish Presidency will do is to try, by working with the European Parliament, to ensure the adoption of the Directive on interpreting and translation rights in criminal proceedings proposed by 13 Member States."
"It was not possible to continue with the proposal tabled by the Commission and 13 Member States have replaced this initiative."
"We want this initiative to be approved, naturally in cooperation with the European Parliament."
"Apart from this, we hope that the Commission will put the appropriate initiatives in place for the remaining aspects of procedural guarantees."
"We are very willing for this to happen as soon as possible so that we can start the process of adopting them, again in conjunction with the Council and Parliament."
"I would like to end by telling you that the Spanish Presidency is planning to organise a seminar in Madrid this coming March, together with the Commission and the European Law Academy, on the subject of Common Standards in Procedural Guarantees."
"This shows, Baroness Ludford, that we agree wholeheartedly with you and those who supported this question on the urgency of regulating these matters, of harmonising them throughout Europe and, naturally, of keeping Parliament informed at all times on how the work is progressing."
"Thank you for this question."
"You know how much I value these procedural guarantees."
"It is true that, for many years, the Commission has been fighting to ensure that minimum common rules relating to the right of defence are genuinely applied in all criminal proceedings in Europe."
"This is necessary for judicial cooperation and it is a condition for the vital mutual confidence among the Member States."
"The Commission has worked tirelessly to ensure that European legislation is adopted in this area."
"Moreover, it is true that, thanks to the Swedish Presidency, the roadmap was adopted by the Council on 30 November 2009."
"This is a fundamental step in the creation of European legislation on minimum procedural rights."
"The Member States have, through this act, agreed on the scope of this legislation and on the need to adopt it as a matter of priority in full cooperation with the European Parliament."
"Like you, I have just listened to Mr López Garrido, who gave a very good explanation of how the Spanish Presidency also tended towards this will to adopt these initial measures, which will provide us with a range of minimum guarantees."
"It is true that the roadmap's step-by-step approach ultimately seemed to us to be a good solution."
"This approach will allow us to achieve our intended objective."
"The step-by-step approach means not only that a more thorough analysis can be made of each right in the context of the legislative proposal, but also that, in negotiations, each right can be examined individually."
"That allows us to avoid cross-sector bargaining, which sometimes characterises legislative texts that are too broad-based and can allow some Member States to hijack the negotiations in order to gain an advantage on a very specific point."
"So, Mrs Ludford, I am sure that the new Commission will work as quickly as possible to table all the legislative proposals provided for in the roadmap and to have them adopted at the earliest opportunity."
"With regard to the right to interpretation and translation, which is the first provision of the roadmap, the Commission has noted the initiative presented by a number of Member States."
"This initiative, I must say, is based on the Commission's proposal of July 2009 and on the negotiations held within the Council during the second half of 2009."
"However, it is true that the Member States' initiative is not in full conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, or with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights."
"The Commission's old proposal, which made the interpretation of meetings between the accused and defence counsel compulsory, is not completely followed up by the Member States' initiative, which limits this right to communications that take place in front of police authorities and during the trial."
"Moreover, the Commission's old proposal provided for a right to translation, a more comprehensive right in the text of the Commission."
"Of course, there will be work in this area between the European Parliament and the Council, and I think we will be able to obtain an ambitious text regarding procedural rights."
"This is essential if we want to create a truly European judicial area."
"We will also ensure that the text complies with the standards laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Therefore, I am sure that we will be able to count on Parliament to act on this matter and, once again, I note that the Spanish Presidency will also lend us its support."
"Although progress has been made in the area of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, very little progress has been made with regard to guaranteeing and ensuring the rights of suspected and accused persons."
"The importance of common standards is an essential condition for instilling mutual trust in the Member States' legal systems."
"The lack of balance between the rights of suspected and accused persons, on the one hand, and the instruments which the prosecution has available, on the other, may jeopardise the principle of mutual recognition of decisions."
"This is why the initiative launched by the Swedish Presidency in July 2009 to present a roadmap for consolidating the procedural rights of suspected or accused persons has marked a very important step forward."
"As far as the right to translation and interpretation is concerned, the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force on 1 December has established a new institutional framework."
"The proposal for a framework decision pending in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs needed to be converted into a proposal for a directive for the work on this dossier to be able to continue."
"We were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights."
"This is why we decided to submit these questions to the Commission and Council."
"Shortly after they were submitted in December, 13 Member States, including Romania, presented an initiative for a European Parliament and Council directive."
"I am confident that in the course of the whole process, we will manage to make improvements to this text, both with regard to its scope of application and to ensuring the integrity of the procedures and the quality of translation and interpretation."
"With regard to the other measures stipulated in the roadmap, we believe that they are intended to ensure access to rights, as well as to legal advice and assistance, to establish special guarantees for suspected or accused persons who are vulnerable, and to provide information about the rights they have and the costs involved."
"We would like to see clear commitments from the Council and Commission so that proposals for a regulation are submitted as quickly as possible."
"The differences which currently exist between Member States require common standards to be adopted urgently."
"I wish to welcome the Spanish Presidency and, at the same time, emphasise that this is the first initiative on procedural rights."
"We had been debating this topic but it was left in the air when the Swedish Presidency ended."
"This draft initiative is already with Parliament and the first debate has already taken place."
"We therefore believe that the question is relevant and continues to be relevant due to the importance of the topic."
"Improvements can certainly be made in this area and we hope that progress will be made as the initiative moves through the various stages."
"As Mr Barrot pointed out, the Commission proposal was certainly more ambitious and we must therefore improve on the present text in Parliament."
"It is by no means a new text, however, because it has already been debated by Parliament and the Commission, with the resistance of Member States."
"The Swedish Presidency tried to get things going again with its roadmap, but despite this, the situation is still difficult for Member States."
"The situation clearly changed after the Treaty of Lisbon, because Parliament now makes the decisions."
"We therefore believe that the Commission and the Council must re-examine procedural rights in the new scenario we find ourselves in today."
"We would like these procedural rights to be considered as a package."
"It is not possible to recognise the right to translation without recognising the right to legal assistance or the right to information."
"For that reason, the Commission's plans to carry on tabling these rights year after year must, in our view, be fast-tracked so that the subject can be considered as quickly as possible."
"It is true that anti-terrorist legislation overturns the guarantees, but if we wish to build an area of justice and freedom, we must trust in our values so that we can also convey them to the European project."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this House proposed the creation of the European Arrest Warrant on 6 September 2001."
"Our proposal would still be on a shelf gathering dust if it had not been for the events in New York five days later."
"Mr Bin Laden helped make it a reality, and it was to me that fell the honour of piloting the measure through the House."
"This House insisted at the time that it should be accompanied by minimum procedural guarantees in criminal legal proceedings."
"The Commission made its proposals in 2002 and undertook to see speedy action."
"So why is it that until recently, this has been stuck in the Council's in-tray?"
"Why has the Commission not been waging war to see all of its proposals approved, and not have them approved separately?"
"The European Arrest Warrant has replaced extradition."
"It has substantially cut the time needed for surrender."
"It has encouraged direct contact between Member States' judicial authorities."
"It has ruled out decisions based on political expediency to the extent that Member States surrender their own nationals."
"It has vastly enhanced the rule of law on our continent, but the European Arrest Warrant relies on mutual trust, and there are too many cases where such trust is called into question by our citizens."
"Two of my constituents are currently in detention in Hungary awaiting trial."
"Though their extradition was requested over a year ago, and though they have been there for two months, they have not yet been indicted and their trial may yet be months away."
"One has lost his job and his family's main source of income."
"Both are deprived of the company of loved ones. And yet both may be innocent of the crimes of which they are charged."
"Cases like this give European judicial cooperation a bad name."
"They pour shame on the inaction of governments in Council."
"The authors of this oral question are right: they require Europe's urgent attention."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"I was going to call you the 'Godfather' of the European Arrest Warrant, but I thought it could be misunderstood."
"Mr Watson, you mention Bin Laden and 9/11 as being the justification paving the way for the adoption of the European Arrest Warrant."
"Is it your contention therefore that the European Arrest Warrant should be used only against terrorists and murderers and in cases of serious violent crimes?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, with permission, I did not give Mr Bin Laden as the justification;"
"I said he helped us to speed it up."
"It was never intended solely to cover terrorist crimes; it was intended to cover all serious crimes."
"Those who oppose its use are those who, effectively, oppose the rule of law on our continent and the protection that the European Arrest Warrant gives to our citizens."
"Mr President, Mr Watson is absolutely right when he says that the European Parliament insisted right from the start that the European Arrest Warrant should be accompanied by clear minimum criminal procedural norms."
"We can now clearly see the sort of problems that many Member States are facing because the European Arrest Warrant was built on sand."
"It is indeed built on sand, because the assumption is that Member States should be able to rely on the legal systems of others: that the rule of law and norms relating to fair trials are a reality in the various Member States."
"Just like some here before, I, too, could tell you stories about how that is not actually the case and how urgent it is that the Commission acts, just as my fellow Member proposed a moment ago."
"We need to establish a comprehensive system in which minimal rights in criminal procedures are taken forward."
"I believe that the Treaty of Lisbon will also allow us this opportunity, because now, the European Parliament is a fully competent legislator along with the Council, and it was very agreeable to hear Mr Barrot say that he had confidence in this partnership between the Commission and Parliament."
"The Commission and Parliament must now form an axis of power that truly overcomes resistance on the part of the Member States that have been unwilling to make progress in this matter."
"I promised to tell you a story about what happens if the rule of law is not adhered to but the European Arrest Warrant system is."
"In Finland at present, there is a Chechen couple, Hadižat and Malik Gataev, who have been detained."
"They arrived from Lithuania where, for years, they kept an orphanage for the child victims of the war in Chechnya and, as it turns out, in Chechnya, the security police interrupted their activities on the pretext that there may have been some minor connection with violence in the family; it was perhaps mainly family-related and so not anything actually approaching serious assault, for example."
"Now this couple is in Finland."
"They are applying for asylum and Lithuania is demanding their extradition."
"The case is being heard next Monday at the Helsinki District Court."
"What on earth is one to do in this situation, given that the basic notion here is that Finland should be able to rely on the fact that in Lithuania, this couple will have a fair trial?"
"We have very hard evidence that that has not actually been the case, and I would say that there are any number of examples of everyday cases such as this, where the European Arrest Warrant has actually been meaningless."
"We must be able to make progress in this matter, as, otherwise, it will be completely impossible for us to build the trust between Member States that will inevitably be required if we are to engage in judicial cooperation."
"Mr President, I, too, will give an example, as Mrs Hautala has done."
"A certain young man from Poland was sentenced in Great Britain to life imprisonment for rape, in a trial based on circumstantial evidence, which took place under the influence of a strong smear campaign in the press and which, in the opinion of some observers, did not meet Polish standards, at any rate, for a fair trial."
"The man is now serving his life sentence in a prison in Poland, although Polish law does not provide for a life sentence for rape, only for murder - rape carries a maximum sentence of 12 years."
"We have, therefore, a situation in which there is someone in a Polish prison who has been given a sentence which is not in accord with the principles of Polish law."
"I give this example to illustrate the problem and as an argument for the urgent need to establish certain general standards, both in the area of criminal procedure and, in my opinion, in the area of the rules for carrying out sentences."
"For we are facing, with increasing frequency, situations where the perpetrators of crimes are tried in one country and serve their sentence in another."
"Therefore, I support the idea of standards and the idea of a directive."
"Mr President, the European Union need two legs to walk: one is the Member States, and the other is their citizens, who are represented by their elected representatives in this house."
"Now, it often happens that after the Member States have resolved their problems, they shut up their judicial systems; after allowing their political systems to communicate, they forget to take care of everything else and forget to lay their foundations by creating a basis of trust among the citizens of the European Union."
"This is one of those cases."
"The European mandate clearly speeds things up and makes life easier for the judicial systems within the European Union."
"However, other rights, like the right to translation and interpretation (on which we have the pleasure and honour to work with our fellow Member, Mrs Ludford), are essential if European citizens are to have confidence in their dealings with the judicial systems of other Member States."
"I am pleased to join my colleagues in requesting that the Commission and the Council make haste to produce texts which, via the codecision process, take this process forward in other procedural rights in criminal cases."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - I speak tonight because, as has been mentioned, two constituents - Michael Turner and Jason McGoldrick - are imprisoned in Unit 2 of the Central Budapest jail in Hungary."
"They have been imprisoned since 3 November and they are yet to be tried."
"There is, in fact, no trial date."
"The terms of imprisonment are burdensome."
"They are separated and have no contact with each other."
"They share a small cell with three other prisoners."
"They are confined to their cells 23 hours a day."
"They are permitted three telephone calls and one shower a week."
"They are allowed one family visit per month."
"In short, they are isolated."
"The language barrier makes the isolation worse."
"They are accused of a white-collar crime."
"They are not murderers or terrorists."
"And they are imprisoned only because of the European Arrest Warrant."
"The European Arrest Warrant swept away, at a stroke, the safeguards against arrest established in Britain over a thousand years."
"Well may you shake your head, Mr Watson: it would be better if you apologised."
"Mistaken identity and identity theft mean that what has happened to Jason and Michael can now also happen to any British citizen at any time."
"The Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party all voted in favour of a European arrest warrant."
"To restate Zola, 'J'accuse' - I accuse - the parties of the British political establishment: their support for the European Arrest Warrant has put everyone in Britain at risk of random arrest."
"(HU) As a Hungarian and a criminal lawyer, I should be ashamed because today, here in the EU Parliament, on the subject of the lack of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings, two of my fellow Members, who otherwise represent two different political views, have mentioned Hungary as a flagrant example."
"Though I am ashamed, I have to agree with them because I myself have had similar experiences."
"I ask them, and all you, the few Members still present here during the discussion of this important topic, to consider the following: if they have come to know of such serious infringements of the law in cases of foreigners who are politically quite irrelevant to the Hungarian State and Hungarian Government, what may be the fate of those who are opponents of the Hungarian Government, let us say because they are politically opposed to the government?"
"There are currently 15 persons in jail under preliminary arrest for having tried to take a stand against the corrupt dealings of the Hungarian Government."
"In retaliation, criminal proceedings were brought against them on trumped up charges of terrorism."
"To this day, not a single piece of evidence has been presented; the authorities feel no obligation to point to any kind of evidence."
"They are in custody under the same conditions that you have heard, shut off from their families, from public view and from the press."
"Please, let us join together and do something in order to normalise the situation in Hungary and make it impossible to take advantage of the lack of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings, especially for political reasons."
"Hungary must institute such guarantees."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr López Garrido will not mind if my first words are addressed to Vice-President Barrot."
"I do not know whether we will have the opportunity to be with him in Plenary before the new Commission enters into force, and so, just in case, I would like to thank him for his efforts, intelligence and fantastic collaboration with the European Parliament in this field of justice and home affairs."
"I would like to add my voice to those who consider this field to be very important."
"We do not simply want to build a safe Europe."
"We also want to build a just Europe, so any initiative that has a bearing on procedural rights is vital."
"We have to take measures to support victims and promote respect for the rights of citizens who are brought to justice."
"I believe that this message has two very clear appeals, one of which is for the Council, prompted by Mr Watson, who put it much better than me in his speech."
"It is ridiculous that after eight years, we are still at this stage of the process, and only looking at certain types of rights."
"We must be more efficient and more rapid."
"This is a job for the Council and Parliament, and Commissioner Barrot should also bring his influence to bear on his colleague, the next Commissioner, and the next Commission."
"The Commission must take the initiative in all other areas that have to do with procedural rights, not only those that relate to language and translation."
"(SK) The issue of fundamental procedural rights in criminal proceedings is one of the key topics that should resonate in the field of justice and internal relations."
"In principle, the draft framework decision defines a set of fundamental procedural rights in criminal proceedings, namely the right to legal advice, the right to interpretation and translation, the right to specific attention in sensitive areas, and the right to communicate and cooperate with consular authorities."
"This list of fundamental rights should be considered strictly demonstrative because the role of the European Union is to ensure that Member States respect the broadest possible range of fundamental rights, also with a view to Member States' membership in the Council of Europe and with a reference to its Convention."
"Our effort should be to promote such means of regulation of procedural relations in criminal matters that would provide the aforementioned rights to all participants in criminal proceedings, whether they are victims and injured parties or offenders, in order to reach a fair and democratic judgment that fully meets the purpose of any penalties imposed, which is not only repression but also social rehabilitation and education."
"The Committee calls for the Council to continue work in introducing common European procedural rights in criminal matters."
"An existing common procedure in the form of the European Arrest Warrant has removed the centuries-old safeguards against unjust arrest and imprisonment that the English used to enjoy."
"This is not an academic argument."
"The EAW is destroying innocent people's lives."
"My constituent, Andrew Symeou, is just one of a growing number of people extradited without an English court having the power to consider the prima facie evidence against them and to prevent unjust extradition."
"Extradition has now been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality."
"Mr Symeou has been held for six months in the notorious Korydallos prison without bail or prospect of trial."
"The political cynicism of the British Liberal Democrats is truly breathtaking."
"They now cry crocodile tears in London over Mr Symeou's fate despite having been materially responsible for the common procedures that caused it and while here, they work for more of the same legislation."
"The common procedures are about lowering European legal standards and not raising them."
"Let me make a suggestion."
"If you want higher standards in European criminal proceedings, then adopt habeas corpus, trial by jury and the main provisions of the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 as the common European standards."
"(EL) Mr President, it is crucial that we progress as far as possible with the creation of a common European reference framework for procedural rights during the dispensation of justice."
"The key concept is the concept of trust."
"We want European citizens taking recourse to justice to be confident that their fundamental rights will be protected."
"We also want trust between the Member States in terms of their cooperation and the ultimate dispensation of justice to each person called to account."
"Finally, we need trust from all of us in terms of the dispensation of justice."
"As long as we fail to promote these common frameworks at European level, whether we like it or not, there will sometimes be some crimes which exploit the loopholes and ultimately, we shall not achieve the dispensation of justice we are striving for precisely because no such frameworks exist."
"Having listened to the speeches, I would like to say how pleased I am to see that many MEPs, from very different groups, agree over the need to harmonise procedural guarantees at European level and to draw up a genuine European law on procedural guarantees."
"All the speakers and all the Parliamentary groups agree on the need to draw up a genuine European law on procedural guarantees."
"This illustrates the importance and need for the European integration process and the importance of a citizens' Europe, of a European judicial area and of implementing the Lisbon Treaty."
"This subject is the focus of the Spanish Presidency's programme for the next six months and has received indubitable support in all the speeches I have heard, based on a variety of arguments and seen from different perspectives: the need to move towards harmonised procedural guarantees."
"I would also like to take up the point raised by Mrs Flašíková Beňová, which I believe is very important, on the need to take this step specifically at the time when the European Union is about to sign the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I wish to end, Mr President, by stating that the Council and the Spanish Presidency will work to ensure that all these procedural guarantees are put into practice, through the directives that the European Commission will table in due course and also the directive that is already in progress, based on an initiative by 13 Member States, as far as I remember."
"I would like to make one final point about the European Arrest Warrant."
"The European Arrest Warrant has been brought up only to criticise it."
"I wish to say that the European Arrest Warrant is a fundamental example of European Union and of cooperation against organised crime in the European Union."
"I am entitled to shout this from the rooftops, coming as I do from a country like Spain, which still suffers from terrorism and for which the European Arrest Warrant is an essential weapon in the struggle against terrorism."
"Mr President, the Minister is right, and Mr Coelho put it very well earlier when he said, 'a Europe of security, a Europe of justice'."
"Yes, Mr Watson, the European arrest warrant has been very effective and very useful, even if it is true that, at the same time, we need to get the European judicial area up and running, and it is in this area that we must work for this Europe of justice, so that there really is confidence in the way in which justice is provided throughout Europe."
"In this regard, I would like once again to thank the authors of the question and indeed to tell them again that, on the basis of the text that reflects the general approach of the Council of 23 October 2009, the Commission, with the help of the European Parliament and the Spanish Presidency, will ensure that this is a higher quality text than the current one."
"I would add that we will obviously be careful to formulate all the necessary legislative proposals in due course, so that no initiatives are necessary on the part of the Member States."
"The Commission is already working on the proposal on a letter of rights."
"The Commission will endeavour to have all the measures planned in the roadmap adopted as soon as possible."
"The estimate of one year to enforce each measure is only indicative."
"If the negotiations allow, the Commission is happy to move things up a gear; this is quite clear."
"I firmly believe that opinions have changed and that, with the multiannual Stockholm Programme, we really have an obligation to produce results in this area."
"Moreover, I have to say that, since I have had these responsibilities, I have done everything possible to make progress with this issue of procedural guarantees, and, although we have chosen a step-by-step formula, I believe that we are now well on our way."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Spanish Presidency, convinced as I am that a Europe of justice will make significant progress in 2010."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I am sure there are many outside this Chamber who would like to endorse the remarks of Carlos Coelho in thanking you for your dedication and application as a Commissioner over this period."
"Thank you so much."
"The debate is closed."
"Preventing trafficking in human beings (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question to the Council on preventing trafficking in human beings, by Anna Hedh and Edit Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0341/2009), and"
"the oral question to the Commission on preventing trafficking in human beings, by Anna Hedh and Edit Bauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0342/2009),"
"As we are all aware, trafficking in human beings is one of the most serious and heinous crimes in the world."
"That is why I am very disappointed to be debating this important issue here so late in the evening before an empty chamber with no audience and no journalists."
"In 1850, slavery was officially banned throughout Europe."
"Nonetheless, nearly 200 years later, hundreds of thousands of people are suffering the modern form of slavery that is trafficking in human beings in Europe."
"The European Parliament and the other EU institutions have a huge responsibility to combat and stop modern day slavery, which takes many different forms: forced labour, sex slavery, trading in organs, adoption and begging, for example."
"That is why I am pleased that we are debating this important issue this evening."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for your good cooperation to date and I hope that together, we will ultimately be able to arrive at a common resolution."
"I also hope that the new Commission will present a directive on trafficking in human beings as soon as possible - a directive that is more forceful and goes even further than the proposal made by the old Commission, which was, in itself, a good one."
"In order to tackle the problem of human trafficking we need to have an overall perspective that takes into consideration all the affected policies; that is, not just penal law but also migration."
"We also need to have proper sanctions in place that really reflect the seriousness of this crime and that really hurt those who are making money out of trafficking in human beings."
"We must ensure that the victims receive better help and protection, that particular consideration is given to victims who are minors, and we need better coordination within the EU institutions."
"In order to really get to grips with the problem of human trafficking, however, all the Member States must put substantial effort into preventive work, and that largely means reducing the demand that exists in our countries for the services provided by the victims of human trafficking."
"If we can reduce demand, then the supply of services will also go down."
"Finally, I appeal to the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the Member States and the other EU institutions: let us stand together to put a stop to the trafficking of human beings in Europe, which is a modern form of slavery."
"There is no greater sign of the seriousness of the problem of trafficking in human beings than the fact that even in Europe, several hundred thousand people fall victim to it each year."
"This is probably so unbelievable that the interpreters said several hundred instead of several hundred thousand."
"Popular opinion is also more or less of this view."
"It feels that this is a marginal issue, and underestimates both its consequences and the weight of the phenomenon itself."
"I think that Europe has an obligation to increase the struggle against human trafficking."
"I would like to address two matters."
"The first is the protection of victims, and the second the elimination of demand."
"As regards victim protection, there is a piece of European Community legislation, which the Commission has promised to reassess by 2009."
"Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that this Directive, number 2004/81, indeed requires updating, so far, this reassessment has not seen the light of day, while the majority of victims are treated as accessories to the crime and are further victimised."
"We all know, as well, that without the victims' help, it is impossible to round up the criminal gangs, as the management of Europol has also confirmed."
"I would like to draw attention to the legislative process regarding another matter, namely, the elimination of demand."
"Human trafficking has its own market."
"The laws of supply and demand apply there as they do to other markets."
"We usually deal with the supply side, and more or less forget, or do not want to address, the demand side, although as long as we have not succeeded in eliminating demand, we will probably strive in vain to combat human trafficking."
"In addition, I would like to emphasise the need for policy coordination."
"We have found that within the Commission, certain DGs, certain Directorates-General, do not really coordinate their policies, and the flow of information between them is also unsatisfactory."
"I think that there is work for us to do in this regard as well."
"Mrs Hedh, Mrs Bauer, I could not agree more with the initiative, the question and the debate you have sparked here tonight."
"I believe that human trafficking is the greatest scourge of humanity."
"It is therefore one of the great challenges we must tackle, and one that we must tackle together."
"This is one more example of the importance of combining our efforts at European level, and outside Europe, in order to stamp out this scourge."
"In your question, you began by talking about whether the approach to be taken by the European Union should be human rights centred, holistic, and focus on repatriation and reintegration, social affairs and social inclusion."
"The answer is yes."
"We absolutely agree that this is the right approach."
"We also agree with proportionality in the severity of sentencing - this is another of the points you raised in your question - and with the need for additional measures for victim protection."
"You pointed out and stressed - and I totally agree with you - that victim protection is essential if we are to fight trade and trafficking in human beings and also that consent by a defenceless victim or child to exploitation is absolutely irrelevant; it has to be irrelevant when it comes to punishing this exploitative behaviour."
"I believe that your idea on the subject of demand is also important."
"It is a very important idea that must also be seen through."
"The same applies to the subject of jurisdiction."
"In part 2 of your question, we believe that the coordination of information is absolutely necessary."
"We therefore agree with the proposal in this question, which seems to us highly appropriate."
"You also asked us about preventive measures."
"I can say, on this subject, that the European Union is working on such preventive measures."
"Back in 2005, the Council adopted a plan in this regard, which would need to be implemented effectively."
"Also, as you know, human trafficking is also included in many agreements between the European Union and third countries, for example, the Africa-European Union Strategic Partnership."
"It is also one of the priorities of the stabilisation and association agreements between the European Union and the Western Balkans."
"I should also point out that assistance with the training and awareness raising of people who might come into contact with victims plays an important part in the fight against human trafficking."
"Examples of such people are border police and police and security officers in third countries."
"I wish to end by saying that the Spanish Presidency will work in this direction and will concern itself specifically with the subject of children affected by this trafficking, which is one of the main priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"Among other initiatives, we have called on the Commission to submit an action plan on unaccompanied minors entering the European Union at the start of 2010."
"Lastly, Mr President, during its term of office, during this six-month period, the Spanish Presidency is calling for an immediate debate on a directive to combat human trafficking and I am sure that the new Commission will table this immediately."
"When the Commission produces its draft, the Spanish Presidency will begin its discussions in the Council and with Parliament."
"You can take this as an expression of our determination to fight this modern form of slavery, as the previous speakers aptly described it."
"Mr President, the Minister has just explained how, in fact, this trafficking in human beings is a form of slavery."
"I would very much like to thank Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for having raised this question."
"We must come up with a holistic, multidisciplinary approach which is not limited to repression, but which integrates international cooperation with third countries."
"This integrated approach was that adopted by the Commission following the proposal for a framework decision published in March 2009."
"This framework decision is based on the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, but it goes further."
"Naturally, as the Minister has just said, we are going to use the new legal basis offered by the Treaty of Lisbon to present, as quickly as possible, a proposal for a directive, which will take into consideration the discussions that took place before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"With this new proposal for a directive, we hope to be able to maintain a high level of ambition."
"We feel that the European Parliament must play a central role and that its commitment is very important in terms of further strengthening the European legal framework of measures to combat trafficking in human beings."
"I shall therefore give you some information in response to the content of the question."
"Firstly, penalties: trafficking in human beings constitutes a very serious offence, and it must be punished accordingly."
"Sentences must be severe and the harmonisation of maximum penalties must continue."
"These vary greatly among Member States, from three to twenty years for basic offences and from ten years to life imprisonment for aggravating circumstances."
"While I admit that the way in which sentences are pronounced may differ from one Member State to another, such an enormous discrepancy between penalties is unjustifiable in a European context, and so in the new proposal, we will provide for very severe penalties."
"I now come to the help and protection provided to victims."
"The help, support and protection given to victims of people trafficking, notably as regards accommodation, medical and psychological assistance, advice, information, interpretation services and legal representation, are all essential."
"Obviously, as it is something the Spanish Presidency wishes, we will also consider specific and more protective measures for child victims of trafficking."
"The system for legal aid and representation should be free, especially for children."
"Finally, in the course of 2010, the Commission will publish its first report on the implementation of the directive relating to residence permits issued to nationals of third countries who are victims of trafficking in human beings and who cooperate with the competent authorities."
"Following this report, we will see whether it is appropriate to amend the directive."
"As for measures aimed at discouraging demand, in its future proposal for a directive, the Commission also intends to include a clause obliging Member States to take initiatives in this area, as well as to encourage them to criminalise the use of sexual services or labour when the user knows that the person is or has been a victim of trafficking in human beings."
"As far as jurisdiction is concerned, we must increase the capacity of each Member State to prosecute not just its own nationals, but also people who habitually reside on its territory, and who are found guilty of trafficking in human beings abroad."
"This is essential when it comes to combating the phenomenon of the so-called new mafias, namely criminal organisations made up of individuals of different nationalities, who establish the centre of their criminal interests, and therefore their habitual residence, in a country of the European Union."
"Next I come to data collection."
"The Commission has invested heavily in the development of common indicators for data collection."
"We must provide the European Union with reliable and comparable statistics."
"Several important projects have been carried out, and the results of these initiatives must be followed up in an appropriate manner, allowing the development of a common model of indicator with Eurostat, with the agencies of the European Union, Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"Finally, I will end with prevention."
"We have a financial programme, 'Prevention of and Fight against Crime' which, in 2010, will include a targeted appeal concerning the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"Then, the Stockholm Programme provides for specific action which, in the general guidelines document adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, concerns measures to strengthen cooperation with third countries."
"A more comprehensive policy for combating trafficking in human beings is therefore taking shape."
"As I have said, the Commission will present a draft directive very soon, and I am delighted that the Spanish Presidency has, for its part, announced a debate that will enable you to further enrich the Commission's proposal which, it seems to me, is timely given that this phenomenon is unfortunately far from being in decline and is still growing in our Member States."
"It is therefore time to react, and to react forcefully."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer for their initiative."
"Human trafficking, as everyone has said, is an extremely serious offence linked to sexual exploitation and illegal employment."
"These crimes are committed by unscrupulous people who recruit their victims through violence or deception, perhaps by promising an honest, well-paid job or through threats, directed not only at the victims, but also at their children or relatives."
"Unfortunately, as is often the case, it is women and children who pay the highest price."
"It is estimated that there are nearly three million victims of trafficking worldwide, and nearly 90% of these are women and children."
"In 2008, with the first European strategy on the rights of children, the European Parliament stated that trafficking in children has many criminal aims: trafficking in organs, illegal adoption, prostitution, illegal work, forced marriages, exploitation of street begging and sexual tourism, to give just a few examples."
"In that document, trafficking was described as a real scourge within the European Union, and it was said that combating trafficking and exploitation must therefore become a priority for the future agenda of the European Union, first and foremost, through the adoption of all the urgent legislative measures needed to guarantee the full protection of and provision of assistance to victims."
"The recent Stockholm Programme also talked about the trafficking and exploitation of minors."
"In conclusion, therefore, and in the light of this evening's debate, our hope is that the Commission and the Council will maintain their commitments and that the Commission will produce this new proposal for a directive, which we will assess very carefully."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the achievement of Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer today, although speaking at a very late hour, as Mrs Hedh said, is to come here tonight and hear the outgoing Commissioner, Mr Barrot, and the new Spanish Presidency use words like 'determined' and 'ambitious' for the Commissioner."
"It is worth waiting until this late hour to hear it, because there are many people in this Chamber today, including the authors, who understand the complexity of this brutal modern day phenomenon, but also understand that the EU is expected by its citizens to tackle this modern day scourge."
"Mr Barrot talked about the need for new legislation."
"We hope we will see the Commission proposal very soon."
"This morning, at the hearing of Commissioner-designate Mrs Malmström, we also saw a positive response to our proposal for an EU anti-trafficking coordinator."
"If you start to put together the various pieces of this puzzle, at least we are moving forward, but the sheer scale of the problem described by Anna Hedh means that we really have to turn words into action."
"With trafficking being such a complex phenomenon, touching on so many different areas such as forced labour, organised crime, sexual exploitation and child abuse, our response must be multi-pronged and holistic."
"Mr Barrot listed many of the things that we would like to see as a reality and, if they come together in a package across the EU, we will have a determined policy which EU citizens will see as a plan of action."
"At the moment, EU citizens understand the scourge of trafficking but they do not see the holistic approach and they do not understand what the EU is doing as a whole."
"I am happy that Commissioner-designate Malmström underlined her commitment today to come forward with a new legislative proposal very soon, and I am also happy to see the Spanish Presidency underlining not just the fight against trafficking but related issues such as violence against women."
"It is important that these all come together to show real determination and heart in this proposal."
"Although the hour is late, we now need the words to be turned into action and the authors have done a good job for us today."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment and excellent cooperation, as this really is an important subject."
"As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime."
"Europol's figures, cited in the question, show that there has been no improvement in this field."
"The opposite is true, in fact."
"In the area of forced labour, specifically, the figures are going up, whilst the figures on the trafficking of women remain unchanged."
"It is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action."
"In order for such action to succeed, it is necessary, first and foremost, to adopt an integrated approach in the most varied of areas."
"One absolutely essential element is to increase awareness - including amongst the population within Europe - that human trafficking takes place right in the middle of Europe, in every country."
"We need, above all, to get to work on education in this regard, as we did, for example, for the football World Cup in Germany, in order to bring the issue of forced prostitution to light, and to show that this really happens everywhere, and also to inspire debate amongst the populace so that there is an awareness there which will lead to the victims being helped."
"My second point concerns the protection of victims."
"Precisely when people are rescued from such a dramatic situation, the Member States, too, must ensure that there is medical and psychological care for them so that they are supported in going back to their countries of origin where appropriate or so that the way is opened to asylum or other similar possibilities here to find a new home and to begin a new life."
"Today, there was a report in a Dutch newspaper about an asparagus farmer who was taken into custody because she was suspected of human trafficking and of using slave labour by Romanians, in other words, European citizens."
"Human trafficking is not just something that takes place with citizens of countries outside the Union, but also with those of countries within it."
"A well-integrated policy on combating human trafficking cannot simply be limited to taking traffickers like this one into custody and robustly tackling those who commit such crimes, but must also properly focus on the victims."
"Their rights and their future must be top priority."
"Victims of human trafficking should never get the impression that they are alone or that they have been left in the lurch."
"We must support them in all kinds of ways: legally, medically, socially and in communities and financially, and we should possibly also compensate them."
"The ability of these victims to take possession of their rights and make use of the opportunities that our law allows for is crucial in any new directive."
"I heard good things from Mr López Garrido and Mr Barrot in this regard."
"The Commissioner also said that people who use the services of people who have been trafficked should face stiffer penalties."
"For me, stiffer penalties for such activities are certainly not wrong, but I do wonder how we help the victims if we further criminalise their function, their work - as it is still work, even if it is slave work."
"How does it help the victims if they have to be afraid that the work that they are doing at that point in time is being criminalised still further?"
"I would appreciate an answer to this question."
"In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's book, victims of human trafficking have a right to a residence permit, a permanent residence permit under certain circumstances, in order to ensure that they do not have to be afraid of being sent back to the country where it all started and in order to ensure that they are able to bring charges against the trafficker, as they are safe in the knowledge that their stay in the country is secure."
"This is because there must not be even a small chance that anyone is sent back and then comes across the trafficker again."
"Your new framework directive, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, must be about empowering the victims."
"It must give them rights and a new future."
"That is what I would like to see."
"Mr President, it is a matter of extreme embarrassment that modern Europe, which enjoys freedom and respect for human rights, has become a place of oppression and abuse for so many people."
"This is all the more shocking because it often concerns women and children, who are at particular risk and are especially helpless."
"As Minister for Justice and Prosecutor General in Poland, I supervised numerous investigations which revealed that such things are happening in Europe, that they extend beyond the borders of particular countries and are sometimes very cruel in nature."
"The main objective of human trafficking is sexual exploitation or enforced slave labour."
"In order to prevent and eliminate these phenomena effectively, it is essential that in particular EU Member States, professional enforcement agencies exist which ideally would be centralised, and would guarantee decisive and effective action as well as good international cooperation."
"European Union institutions should play a major role, especially as regards that last point."
"In addition, there are two other matters."
"Conscious of the fact that human trafficking is often the work of organised criminal gangs, individual countries should guarantee sufficiently severe sanctions for such serious crimes in order to deter and isolate the perpetrators, including sanctions in the form of seizure of assets, which would strike at the economic reason for their activity."
"Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance."
"Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission's part."
"One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims."
"Only if this succeeds - and not only through punitive measures - can human trafficking be combated at all."
"That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims."
"One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses."
"This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted."
"Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed."
"Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling."
"When dealing with children it is also necessary - coming back to this point - for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers."
"There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors."
"I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, during the hearing of the Commissioner-designate, I heard a very specific commitment regarding combating human trafficking."
"I have been pleased to hear a unanimous opinion expressed here."
"The same unanimity was not heard when, many years ago, some people occupying these seats - including myself - denounced the dangers that mass illegal immigration would give rise to, among them, a substantial boost for the criminal organisations that utilise this labour and the risks of human trafficking and even organ trafficking."
"Today, everyone has discovered this phenomenon, and we can only be pleased with the unanimous nature of the commitment."
"However, it is important for us to realise that the cause is still the same."
"The cause, the origin, the breeding ground for this trafficking has but one name, or a main name, a main cause: the scale of illegal immigration and the role played in it by local, European and also non-European criminal organisations, because now we also have trafficking in humans easily managed by organisations outside Europe."
"Now, let us take this as our starting point."
"We should take a considered view that this extremely serious and shameful phenomenon is a sub-species or sub-consequence of mass illegal immigration that has not been properly controlled."
"Europe should have the courage to call a spade a spade."
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, should like to take my turn in congratulating the authors of this very important question."
"We are living in modern times in which one would expect trafficking in human beings to have been eliminated from our society."
"Unfortunately, however, the numbers refute this."
"For example: it is estimated that over 1 800 000 children and young people fall victim to trafficking throughout the world every year."
"According to UN figures, we have 270 000 victims in the European Union."
"In Greece alone, the estimated number of victims of trafficking for prostitution has been increased to 40 000 a year, including women and children, but excluding other forms of trafficking."
"The two basic parameters that I should like to highlight, without underestimating the importance of other parameters are: firstly, the European institutional framework for combating this crime, which is cross-border and is exacerbated by illegal immigration, is - as has rightly been said - inadequate."
"That is why we need to up the ante towards a holistic approach and the directive we are awaiting is very important within this framework, as has rightly been said."
"Secondly, a particular gap has been identified in the protection of victims, especially in terms of support structures."
"It is therefore necessary - and I am delighted to have heard this from the Spanish Presidency - for resources and infrastructures to be made available in order to improve any existing infrastructures and create new infrastructures and, of course, to give the staff which can provide such support suitable training."
"This modern form of the slave trade cannot and must not have any place in a European Union based on the principle of respect for human rights and human dignity."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question, for which I warmly thank the authors, and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees."
"I am also very happy to have heard very serious commitments voiced by the Commission and also by the Spanish Presidency, and I truly hope that the new directive will soon be drafted along the lines that essentially seem to enjoy a large consensus."
"I think we know that the numbers in this field are very complex to analyse, but in brief, we are talking about almost 300 000 people, 79% of them women, many of them minors, being trafficked every year in our civilised Europe."
"Unfortunately, numbers have been rising in recent years."
"For this reason, too, we need to make very strong progress in the light of the new areas of responsibility that the European Union has and also in the light of what we have already approved in the Stockholm Programme to bring in some innovations."
"It was a great step forward when we approved, at EU level, the provision - which, for example, had already been in force in Italy since 1998 - allowing humanitarian residence permits to be issued to victims."
"However, we must also make progress on safeguarding victims in relation to protection, social and employment reintegration, the possibility of preventing there being customers - which we must think very seriously about - and more serious and effective measures on sanctions which must, as you said, Commissioner, be harmonised at EU level."
"In particular, we ask that the consent of victims to their exploitation be considered irrelevant, in view of the high level of blackmail involved in these circumstances."
"I will conclude very shortly, just adding this: we need not only special protection for minors but, above all, also forms of support for persons arriving in Europe who have already previously suffered forms of trafficking along the journeys, ever longer and ever more tragic, that they complete before reaching our coasts and our territories."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Spanish Presidency for their boldness in enabling us to finally find a serious solution to this problem."
"When we talk about human trafficking, it is extremely important for us to think about establishing a permanent policy at European Union level."
"Such a policy will contribute to a more coordinated approach and enable Member States' actions to have a greater impact in terms of law enforcement, and protection and assistance provided to the victims of this form of trafficking."
"The appointment of a European Union coordinator for combating human trafficking, working under the direct supervision of the commissioner responsible for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, will guarantee that a single, coherent political approach is used by all Member States in tackling this serious crime."
"The coordinator's role will be to identify the problems and sources of human trafficking, implement preventive measures, devise and enforce strategies at European level, including active cooperation and consultation with civil society agencies, as well as to organise information campaigns and introduce measures to increase protection for and provide help to victims, and also support them in the reintegration process."
"In order to tackle this global, transnational problem successfully, a coordinated strategy is required at European level which guides and supports Member States in their joint efforts to combat human trafficking effectively. Thank you very much for your attention."
"One who is another's property and a helpless victim of some dominating influence - you might be forgiven for thinking this is a definition of human trafficking."
"In fact, it is a definition of slavery."
"Trafficking is today's slavery."
"Trafficking of people, be it women, men or children, is a criminal offence and on the increase in all Member States."
"Extreme poverty, family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some of the root causes of human trafficking."
"In the UK, we estimate approximately 5 000 victims, of which 330 are children."
"The ECR Group welcomes this debate."
"National governments, law-enforcement agencies and border-control agencies need to work together."
"Mechanisms for victim support need strengthening."
"Initiatives must be robust, Member State-driven and EU-supported."
"(SV) If there were no demand for exploiting people as cheap labour, if there were no demand for organs, if there were no demand for the purchasing of sexual services - then in such a world, we would not have trafficking in human beings either."
"Demand is a key word as regards the combating of trafficking in human beings."
"Another important factor is that people in many parts of the world are living in poverty and in inhumane conditions, with the result that they can easily fall prey to those wanting to buy and sell human beings."
"We therefore need not just efforts to reduce demand, but also, of course, preventive measures in the form of improving living conditions for many people in those parts of the world where the victims are recruited."
"I and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left would like to thank Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer and their colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"However, I would like to see some differentiated proposals for how we can support the victims of trafficking in human beings."
"Those who are victims of forced labour need different measures and support to those who are victims of the sex slave trade."
"(ES) According to a United Nations report, in 2009, some 270 000 people were victims of human trafficking within the European Union."
"With these figures in mind, we need to ensure that European Union action is based, first and foremost, on victim protection, with special focus on the situation of women and children, who are the most vulnerable."
"We cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted, to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes."
"For this reason, I completely support the Parliament's demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted, as Mr Barrot has just told us."
"Having said that, I would like to call on the Spanish Presidency, the European Commission and the Council to use all the European legislation at their disposal, both existing and future legislation, to protect the victims of human trafficking."
"I consider that the proposed European victim protection system, which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates, and which has finally come to fruition, will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes."
"I hope for a firm undertaking, as we have already seen, from the Spanish Presidency, to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the European Union."
"I hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises."
"We really owe it to all the victims."
"(SK) First of all, I would like to express my appreciation for my fellow MEPs, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, because despite the limited space available to them, they approached this topic very comprehensively."
"I support the question and I would like to add a few factual observations and notes."
"Ordinary people usually have no idea of the enormous scale of trafficking in human beings."
"As a matter of fact, it is the third most lucrative illicit trade in the world."
"The fact that it mostly concerns women and children makes this immense business all the more inhumane."
"Our response to it must be massive and concentrated."
"Our fight has to be equally effective at all points of the trafficking triangle - it has to impact the supply and demand sides, as well as the traffickers themselves."
"Supply exists especially where there are inhumane living conditions, poverty and its feminisation, unemployment, violence against women, and overall oppression and instability engendering desperate human beings."
"Therefore, we should do everything in our power to help the people who fall victim to criminal trafficking within and outside the Union live a more dignified life."
"The demand side deserves strict sanctions."
"Those who profit from exploitation of desperate or manipulated people within the grey economy must not go unpunished."
"Those who provide such services and those who use them consciously should also be faced with sanctions."
"Finally, trafficking operators deserve exemplary punishment - organised crime in this area must be a priority target for organisations such as EUROJUST, EUROPOL and FRONTEX."
"(SV) Slavery has not yet been abolished, as many in this House have already emphasised."
"Modern day slavery takes the form of the sex trade, and it is going on here and now."
"The bodies of women, girls and boys are sold like pieces of meat, just like any other goods, and it is happening all the time."
"People are robbed of their most basic human rights and become the slaves of our times in our various Member States."
"This ought to be seen as Europe's greatest failure and shortcoming, and it must be dealt with by restricting and stopping both supply and demand."
"In my home country of Sweden, a law entered into force ten years ago under which it is illegal to purchase sex."
"This law is important, because through it, society signals that no human being is for sale."
"The slave trade to America was made illegal in 1807, but it is still going on right in our midst in Europe."
"It is time that it was consigned to the dark recesses of history."
"It is our time and our responsibility to do all we can and I would like to thank the authors, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer, for their excellent work that benefits us all."
"(PL) Mr President, a few minutes ago, the representative of the Green party very correctly emphasised that this matter - human trafficking, or the sale of living people - is not an external problem which is imported by the European Union."
"It is also an internal problem."
"Citizens of my country are also being sold to at least several Member States of the European Union."
"It is a very significant and serious problem."
"It is my conviction that, on this matter, strong, united action is needed, and not only from EU institutions, but also from individual Member States."
"I will recall, here, an incident which took place a couple of years ago, when the Italian police and administration, reacting to certain information coming from Poland, put an end to cases of human trafficking where Polish workers were being illegally employed in Italy."
"This, too, is human trafficking, and we must not be silent about it."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, every year more than one million people are abused for slave labour, and 90% of them are abused for the purpose of sexual services."
"Only 3 000 victims have received assistance, and a mere 1 500 cases have been brought to court, even though this qualifies as a criminal offence throughout the European Union."
"Studies have shown that the profits from trafficking in human beings exceed those from drug smuggling and dealing."
"This kind of organised crime has grown with the Union's enlargement to the east."
"And yet, we still have no common strategy, and there is no coordination of measures taken by the various institutions and the Member States, which should not resist harmonisation of their legislation, even though this is not anchored in the treaties."
"That is why I am asking the Spanish Presidency to complete negotiations with the Member States on the common definitions of punishments and sanctions."
"I would like to stress that the new directive we are waiting for should also combat more effectively the demand for illegal sexual services; in actual fact, it is alarming that the abuse of children in particular has been rising."
"In the case of children, the figure is nearing 20%."
"Also missing is effective prevention and education focused on children and parents alike."
"Do you know that only 4% of the parents of abused children admitted that their children had been lured to meetings via the Internet?"
"As many as 1 500 websites where children are sexually abused were discovered in 2008."
"What we undoubtedly owe to the citizens of the European Union is a new, coordinated approach, and harmonisation of legislation to also combat the demand for and naturally the trafficking in humans itself."
"Therefore, I urge the Commission to submit to the European Parliament a comprehensive legislative proposal for a more effective struggle against trading in humans, within the shortest possible time."
"(DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the authors for this important initiative, for the EU faces a huge challenge in preventing and combating trafficking in human beings."
"Trafficking in human beings is a rapidly growing lucrative business, and it is attractive because the punishments are mild compared with other money-making forms of organised crime such as drugs and the arms trade."
"Consequently, we have to come down hard on those behind it."
"The victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable and defenceless people, and they need our protection."
"We must not send them back into the arms of the human traffickers."
"They must be offered residence permits."
"In addition, we must also focus on the demand for the services that are provided by people trafficked and implement various measures such as criminalising the purchase of prostitution and increasing the sanctions against those who use trafficked labour."
"I am therefore pleased that the Commission is contemplating the criminalisation of the abuse of trafficked human beings."
"(LT) Events of recent days in Lithuania, when an organised gang was arrested for profiting from human trafficking, demonstrated once again that this crime is a widespread phenomenon that is intensifying even more during the economic and financial crisis."
"At present, almost 90% of the victims of people trafficking are women and children, the majority of whom fall victims because of poverty and attempts to seek means to survive."
"Human trafficking is a monstrous crime and an extreme humiliation of human dignity; there is nothing worse than being sold into slavery."
"Therefore, it is very important to strengthen cooperation between the Member States and with third countries, to ensure a dialogue with non-governmental organisations and to call on the Commission to establish the position of a European coordinator for these matters."
"It is also necessary to ensure the security of victims of trafficking in human beings and their complete integration."
"The accomplices, organisers or sponsors of this terrible crime must not be allowed to avoid responsibility."
"(SK) I would like to congratulate the authors of this question, Mrs Hedh and Mrs Bauer."
"I would like to say that trafficking in human beings is one of the most profitable forms of international organised crime and, according to various reports and sources, its worldwide scale is estimated to be between 700 000 and 2 million persons, some say more, of whom 300 to 500 000 individuals are victims of trafficking in the European Union alone."
"The current legal framework appears to be inadequate; therefore, I fully support the adoption in the near future of effective measures to strengthen both prevention and repression of trafficking in human beings."
"Stricter sanctions should be imposed on the direct offenders, including legal persons, as well as the users of services provided by the victims."
"On the other hand, I firmly believe that a high level of protection, together with fair and adequate compensation, needs to be provided to the victims, regardless of the Member State in which they are located or where the crime was committed."
"The protection, support and assistance provided must not lead to secondary victimisation and I would also like to say that the provisions relating to minors, who easily become victims due to their vulnerability and gullibility, deserve special attention."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that trafficking in human beings also often occurs for the purpose of organ harvesting."
"(DE) Mr President, it is quite significant that we should be debating the subject of human trafficking here today, as this is a subject that remains taboo and since, unfortunately, in our highly developed society, it is women who, in particular, are very often victims of such human trafficking."
"I am thinking of prostitution, first and foremost, but also of children."
"Very often, we do not want to see it."
"For a successful programme against human trafficking, we need to prioritise education, awareness-raising, and we will need money later on."
"We should take this into account in our considerations right from the start, as it cannot just be the aim to arrest the perpetrators and enforce a just punishment; we must also seek to have victim protection that means victims do not become victims a second time, but that we also have the funds to re-integrate them into society."
"We must aim to take away the traumas experienced by children and integrate the women, as a top priority, into our working world, a legal working world."
"Mr President, European action on this issue is long overdue, so I was very pleased to hear Mr López Garrido's remarks on children, the Commissioner's remarks and, this morning, that Commissioner-designate Malmström plans to bring forth a new directive in this area as a priority."
"I want to urge both the Council and Commission to look at the support systems for victims, particularly the specific needs of trafficked children, who have very different needs to those of trafficked adults."
"In the UK, last year alone, 325 children were identified as being suspected victims of trafficking."
"Many of those were UK citizens trafficked within the UK, not externally sourced, if I might use that expression."
"There are children in my own region who are trafficked but we find that, even after registration with social services, many trafficked children just disappear because they remain under the control of their traffickers."
"They find it just too easy to re-traffic these children."
"This occurs all over the EU and we must put a stop to it."
"Trafficked people are voiceless and vulnerable and they rely on the European Union to speak out for them, to stop this abhorrent crime, and to care for them."
"(DE) Mr President, begging, prostitution, theft and burglary - human traffickers and people-smuggling gangs need people, primarily women and children, for these and other, similar objectionable activities."
"We are talking about hard-to-monitor criminal activity here, with a very high number of unreported cases."
"At this point, I would like to point out that my home country of Austria is particularly affected, as a popular transit country, but also as a popular final destination."
"We therefore need to be aware that the vast majority of people-smuggling gangs are active in moving people from eastern and south-eastern Europe to central Europe and that the victims are not only recruited in third countries but also come from the Member States themselves."
"The fact is that there has been a rise in such cases and that our external border controls scarcely function."
"In the light of this development and the verifiable reality that these journeys are often undertaken in buses - criminal tourism - the question must be asked as to whether it would not make sense, in these circumstances, in addition to the drawing up of reports by Europol, Frontex and others, to re-introduce border controls in the relevant border regions and suspend Schengen for a limited period where necessary."
"(SK) I congratulate the authors on the submitted question and you, Commissioner, on your response."
"I would like to underline one of the many topics relating to this issue."
"The draft resolution states that children are particularly vulnerable and thus at greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human beings."
"At the same time, it says that 79% of the identified victims of trafficking are women and girls."
"However, it fails to mention that parents should play a primary role in protecting children from trafficking."
"Parents often do not even know what risks their children are exposed to or are not at all interested in how they spend their spare time."
"In the context of prevention, I have repeatedly proposed a European-wide campaign called: 'Do you know where your child is now?'"
"This campaign should alert parents to the risks that their children face."
"I firmly believe that we can protect children from trafficking only if we cooperate with parents."
"Unfortunately, parents are not mentioned anywhere in the draft resolution."
"(PL) Mr President, in the context of today's debate, it is necessary to draw attention to three matters which require particular attention."
"Too few criminals are brought to justice."
"Despite the rise in the number of criminal proceedings involving human trafficking, it is still many times lower than the number of crimes committed."
"The victims do not receive appropriate assistance, shelter or compensation."
"Bearing in mind the estimated scale of human trafficking in Europe, it should be noted that only several countries have taken measures which can be said to be a real reaction."
"Thirdly, the situation is not being monitored sufficiently."
"It is obvious that this problem does not affect only the European Union."
"It is, therefore, of key significance that the Union work yet more closely with the appropriate international organisations to create a new standard in the fight against this terribly dangerous phenomenon."
"I believe that this wide-ranging debate has served to highlight that we are faced with an enormous problem, a problem that poses us an enormous challenge."
"I am pleased that this debate has taken place on the very day that I have spoken before the European Parliament for the first time, which is undoubtedly an honour."
"I am pleased that it has happened in these two important debates that have been held tonight in this important and mighty Parliament."
"I believe that it is not enough to simply refer to or reflect on this huge problem."
"It must be tackled with all our strength because it is a very serious problem and the enemies we are facing are very strong."
"We therefore need great political will to tackle the problem."
"Here tonight, this great political will has been displayed, and how!"
"I can assure you that the Spanish Presidency is going to show it means to tackle this matter, together with all the other European institutions."
"I believe we can also say that this is a problem that must be tackled from a European perspective."
"You have stated very clearly how such things come to pass in Europe;"
"Mrs Hirsch pointed it out clearly and Mr Papanikolaou and Mrs Parvanova spoke about the cross-border nature of this matter."
"It is happening in Europe and we must tackle it from Europe."
"It has been repeated many times and I repeat it now: it is important for the Commission to propose a directive as soon as possible in order to tackle the problem from this angle."
"I believe that Mrs Roithová put it very succinctly in her speech."
"I believe that the three major aspects that we must cover and emphasise in the regulation that will be issued by Europe, in the work that will be done by Europe, must be as follows."
"The first is victim protection."
"Victim protection is a central aspect and certainly the one most discussed here tonight."
"The authors of the question, Mrs Sargentini, Mrs Ernst, Mrs Thomsen and other speakers indicated the importance of victim protection, which normally refers, above all, to women and children - the most vulnerable people."
"Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, Mrs Kadenbach and Mrs Bearder also eloquently expressed the need to introduce a victim protection system, which is an essential instrument and a priority of the Spanish Presidency."
"Victim protection, then, is in first place; secondly, we must have tireless persecution and harsh punishment for traffickers - Mr Ziobro expressed this very forcefully in his speech; and thirdly, we must consider the subject of demand for these services."
"This is something hard to tackle but it is part of the problem and, as such, I therefore believe it must be included as one of the three major aspects on which I believe a global approach must be based."
"As I stated before, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency is and will be absolutely committed to a subject of such overriding importance as this."
"Mr President, I believe that this debate has done much to clarify the preparation of the future directive, and I can, of course, confirm Minister that the Commission intends to present it this spring."
"I would like to echo the comments made by Mr Moraes, by saying that we must use the most modern means to fight against this scourge, which itself is also often carried out using the most modern methods, and that we must fight against all forms of exploitation."
"Minister, you said just now that there are three pillars: the victims, the seriousness of the penalties and then the problem of demand."
"I would emphasise somewhat the issue of victims and victim protection since, in the framework decision, we had already negotiated unconditional support for all victims, immunity from criminal prosecution, and the right to legal assistance."
"Furthermore, in the future directive, we intend to deal with accommodation, medical and psychological treatment, advice and information, in a language that is understood by the victim, and then all kinds of supplementary support."
"In response to Mrs Záborská, I would add that, indeed, as far as child victims of people trafficking are concerned, the Commission will address issues relating to the prevention of this scourge, as well as the protection, return and reintegration of these children, in an action plan on the situation of unaccompanied minors."
"Incidentally, Minister, this was a strong demand made by the Spanish Presidency."
"We will therefore present this action plan, which will be adopted by the College in spring 2010, so that it may be examined by the Council and by the European Parliament."
"This action plan will propose several areas of action to tackle the main challenges posed by this phenomenon, which affects unaccompanied minors arriving in the European Union in different contexts, and will be guided by the best interests of the child."
"However, Mrs Záborská is also right; families must be increasingly involved in supervising, in particular, use of the Internet, which exposes children, once again, to new risks."
"As you said, Minister, political will does exist in the European Parliament."
"I believe the Commission has already done some good preparation work on this draft directive."
"It will submit it shortly, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for offering not just its full support, but also a whole series of very interesting ideas that have emerged during this debate."
"Once again, I would like to thank all the speakers."
"Indeed, I believe that the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the fight against this major scourge."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the February I part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Those who are involved in human trafficking do not make any distinction between men, women or children, as long as they can make money from trafficking them."
"Often, it is children who are in the greatest danger."
"According to the ILO, roughly 218 million children are involved in child labour at present."
"It is impossible to give a definite figure, however, as these children are involved in prostitution, slavery, forced labour and so on, areas for which accurate figures are not available."
"The EU must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market."
"I find it encouraging that this issue is a priority of the Spanish Presidency and I hope that members of the Council will work together to put issues related to human trafficking and child labour at the heart of EU legislation and, in particular, that these questions will be dealt with within the context of trade agreements."
"As a result of its important role in global trade matters and its commitment to protecting human rights, the EU has a responsibility to combat human trafficking and child labour."
"in writing. - The trafficking of human beings is deplorable anywhere in the world, but particularly disgraceful in the European Union given our high levels of internal cooperation and resources."
"In particular, the trafficking of young women for use in the sex trade is a relic of Europe's fragmented past and must become an aspect of European history."
"In this regard, the Union must commit over the five-year term of the incoming Commission to increase border security, and to implore national governments to do more to tackle the sex trade, particularly when it involves young women who have been trafficked from another country."
"Currently, the laws exist in most countries but are simply not being enforced."
"The speed with which this debate has been initiated so soon after the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force is not only opportune from a legislative perspective, but is also an absolute requirement dictated by a situation exacerbated by the economic crisis."
"Poverty, job losses, the lack of prospects for young people, the absence of accurate information about the risks involved and an absence of even a minimal level of sex education are some of the factors contributing significantly to the vulnerable situation of the potential victims."
"I believe that a hard-hitting information campaign is required, especially among minors from disadvantaged areas and groups, to improve the effectiveness of preventive actions."
"We cannot talk about specifically combating the trafficking of women without considering strong measures for tackling criminal activities and the networks controlling this traffic, which is extremely busy in the Balkan and Mediterranean regions."
"I want to emphasise that measures are needed to discourage the level of demand for prostitution, which is the most direct route, with the adoption of measures to punish clients."
"I should mention that better funding is also required for the programmes intended to combat human trafficking."
"I call for the adoption of harsh punitive legislation and for closer cooperation between Member States and the authorised European institutions: Europol, Frontex and Eurojust."
"Although two pieces of European legislation currently in force deal with trafficking in human beings and its victims, the Member States of the European Union in practice often look upon these persons as illegal immigrants."
"It is very important to make a distinction between the two."
"Illegal immigrants are often obliged to leave their countries on account of some financial or social circumstance, and they arrive on European territory illegally, albeit as a result of their own decision."
"Those affected by human trafficking have not taken a free, informed decision about all this."
"They are to be treated entirely as victims."
"EU Member States must offer victims adequate protection."
"Not only should they be guaranteed legal or physical protection, but medical and psychological assistance, social rehabilitation, and those who collaborate with the authorities should be given residence permits for the duration of the investigation of the human trafficking case."
"It is important, moreover, that the Commission should use information campaigns to help make sure that all those who may be at risk should be aware of their rights, opportunities and the dangers both within the EU and in third countries, and that it should do everything possible to ensure that Member States duly transpose and implement the relevant European legislation."
"Given that the matter of human trafficking falls under the purview of several commissioners, including the commissioners for justice, freedom and security, for external relations, and for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, it would be worth considering the appointment of a portfolio coordinator who could effectively liaise in order to ensure appropriate handling of this problem."
"in writing. - Women and children are the principal victims of human trafficking."
"When a new Council Framework Decision will be formulated regarding human trafficking, women and children have to be put at the centre of action."
"Therefore, I agree with opinions stating that gender-specific violence data must be collected throughout the European Union as soon as possible."
"Victim protection costs money, and this life-saving money should be spent wisely."
"We should bear in mind that without reliable and comparable data, we will not be able to locate resources to the appropriate places in an appropriate manner."
"We also have to be aware of the fact that different Member States and especially different cultures handle the problem differently."
"There are Member States where victim protection is well organised and reachable for everyone, like in Spain, and there are Member States where it is almost a non-issue."
"That means that we not only need to locate resources wisely, but we also have to come up with practical and statistical solutions (namely with a minimum European standard at least) in order to tackle the latency problem, and in order to draw attention to this question where it is needed."
"in writing. - The problem of the trafficking of human beings has been with us for a long time, but instead of getting to grips with the issue, Member States stand indicted for our individual and collective failure to deal with this exploitation and degradation of women."
"While free movement facilitates trafficking in terms of the removal of border controls, on the other hand, one would imagine that increased police cooperation should be in a position to tackle the problem."
"What is clear is that the political will is not there."
"The May 2005 'Council of Europe Convention on the Action Against trafficking in Human Beings' has only been ratified by nine countries, two thirds of women trafficked for prostitution come from Eastern Europe and yet, countries like the Czech Republic and Estonia have not signed the convention."
"Apart from the political will not being there, the police will is not there either."
"The number of convictions is derisory in terms of the problem; the police do not see human trafficking as a crime."
"The United Nations has estimated that there were around 270 000 victims of human trafficking in 2009 in the European Union."
"The European Union must commit itself in the very near future and come up with legislative instruments which will cover both the prevention of and fight against human trafficking, as well as protection of the rights of trafficking victims."
"Future European legislation will have to review the level of sanctions against traffickers so that they are commensurate with the severity of the offence."
"International judicial cooperation, collaboration among all agencies for protecting minors and those campaigning for human rights, setting up specific funds for providing compensation, and effective protection for victims are all areas which need to be strengthened."
"Furthermore, I feel that Eurojust, Europol and Frontex must have even further involvement in the fight against human trafficking and the protection of victims, as well as collect data and compile statistics on this phenomenon."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Announcement by the President"
"I would like to inform the House that I have received a letter from the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, in which he informs me of the European Council's decision to consult the European Parliament on the proposal by the Spanish Government concerning the composition of the European Parliament and to seek Parliament's consent not to convene a Convention on this matter."
"It concerns the 18 additional Members of the European Parliament."
"I have handed the proposal to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has just begun work on this matter and will shortly appoint a rapporteur."
"Work on this will continue."
"I would also like to tell you that, following the Bulgarian Government's decision to withdraw its candidate for Commissioner-designate, it has put forward a new candidate."
"The Conference of Presidents will decide tomorrow on the final timetable, but the most likely date for the hearing of the new Commissioner-designate is 3 February, with the vote on 9 February."
"This, of course, also depends on a decision from Mr Barroso and on his talks with the Bulgarian Government's newly appointed candidate."
"Nothing has yet been established, but I wanted the House to have this general information about what our next steps will be."
"At all events, the European Parliament is in full control of the situation."
"There are no exceptional situations here, and we are acting in accordance with democratic procedures."
"These procedures are of fundamental significance to us and this is how the European Parliament will always work under my Presidency."
"I would also like to tell you about how the European Parliament envisages working with the two-and-a-half-year permanent Presidency of the European Union and the European Council and how it will work with the rotating Presidency."
"The rotating Presidency, in this case the Spanish Presidency, will always present its six-month plan of action at the beginning of the six-month period and will then present a report of its work at the end of the period."
"The permanent Presidency of the European Council will present the results of its work at European summits."
"As you know, in every six-month period, there are two summits, and the President of the European Council will present the results of the summit twice in each period, hence, four times a year."
"Presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to address my first few words to a country that is suffering pain and tragedy: Haiti."
"I know that we all share the concern, solidarity and commitment of all the institutions of the European Union, starting with the rotating Presidency, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, for a country that is suffering, for a people that is being torn apart by death, destruction and violence, following on from a history of poverty and also conflict."
"There are few occasions where we can show what we can do as Europeans in the manner in which we are going to do in response to the tragedy in Haiti."
"We are going to demonstrate our commitment to what is happening in the world and to the countries that are suffering most."
"Right from the very first moment, holding the rotating Presidency, and in coordination with the Commission and the High Representative, we have sought to respond to the tragedy in Haiti."
"Last Monday, the Council of Ministers on Development met, and next Monday the Council on European Affairs will meet in order to plan a rapid response in terms of aid and humanitarian cooperation on all fronts, for the future of Haiti."
"I am entirely convinced that the response of the international community is a strong, joint response, and that the European Union is going to rise to the occasion."
"In response to the tragedy in Haiti, the only protagonists should be the people suffering there, and I hope and trust that we will do everything we can to help set in motion a complete recovery."
"Both European society and, above all, our deep-seated convictions, demand it."
"Mr President, it is an honour for me to appear here before you in order to explain the main priorities of the Spanish rotating Presidency over the next six months."
"It is more than an honour, it is a great honour."
"It is a great honour because I am speaking on behalf of a country which, in the next six months, will be celebrating its 25th anniversary of joining what was then the European Communities."
"I am speaking on behalf of a European and pro-Europe country, a country which, in the last 25 years, has experienced a major transformation in terms of progress and welfare, largely due to being part of the European Union."
"Europe was the dream of generations, of many generations of Spaniards."
"It was the dream of democracy, of opening up to the world, of progress, of welfare, of the welfare state, of freedom."
"This is what we have seen in Europe, what has been brought to us by Europe, and what we have brought to Europe."
"Twenty-five years later, we feel loyal to Europe and committed to the Union, and there is no more powerful way to be loyal and committed to Europe than to exercise the responsibility of making commitments, taking the initiative and putting forward proposals."
"This is what we want to do during the next six months."
"These will be six months of change because we are taking on the rotating Presidency at a time of economic change, as a result of the most serious financial crisis for eighty years."
"It is a time of political change because of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is changing the way that the European Union is governed."
"It is a time of change in terms of foreign relations, because the phenomenon of globalisation is growing and there are new emerging countries."
"It is also a time of change in terms of the relationship that Europe needs to have with European citizens in order to give effect to everything set out by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It will therefore be a time of change in two circumstances in particular: firstly, the serious economic crisis that we are experiencing, and secondly, the Treaty of Lisbon and its new institutional relationships."
"Regarding the economic crisis, I would like to say the following."
"We are aware that it is a much more serious crisis than we have experienced for eighty years, and we know that, as was the case then, there has never been such a huge decline in global production and international trade."
"We are aware of the serious effects that it has caused in the world and in the European Union."
"The number of unemployed has increased by eight million, many of whom are indeed in my country."
"There has been an effect on public finances, and therefore on the prospects for financial stability, which has impelled and is still impelling us to take urgent cooperative measures."
"It has also driven us to look towards making changes to the European economy and to its production capacity, and towards improving competitiveness in the whole of the Union."
"We need to continue maintaining the fiscal stimuli until the recovery is a reality."
"We need to commit ourselves to maintaining the Stability Pact and fulfil the Commission's indications for 2013."
"We also need to set out an economic strategy for 2020, which the Commission is drawing up and which, in the view of the Spanish rotating Presidency, must be a key matter in the next six months."
"We know what the European Union's strengths and weaknesses are."
"We know that since the mid-1990s, we have been losing our capacity for economic growth, our potential for economic growth."
"We know that since the mid-1990s, we have been losing productivity relative to the big economies that we compete with. We also know that we have difficulties in some specific areas that will determine the future of our growth, competitiveness and innovation in a globalised world."
"We do, however, also have strengths, and we should remember them."
"Our strengths are clear: we represent almost a third of global GDP."
"We are undoubtedly the leading exporting power and the second most important, behind the United States in terms of research, development and innovation."
"We represent almost 60% of global development aid, which is a great strength for the European Union."
"What does Spain see as the fundamental priorities for renewing Europe's economic strength, for creating a sustainable economy from a competitive, environmental and social point of view?"
"I will mention four main themes that I want to promote, which should be included in the 2020 Strategy."
"I would summarise these by saying that, in terms of the economy, the European Union needs to bet on itself."
"It needs to move forward with economic union and cooperation, starting with the sense of responsibility of the Member States, but also ensuring that the Community institutions, specifically the Commission, have new powers to lead and achieve objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the last ten years, our energy dependency has increased by nine percentage points, and this is one of the primary areas in which we must take steps and make changes."
"Energy dependency has increased from 44% to 53% in the whole of the European Union."
"These nine percentage points amount to exactly EUR 64 million that we send to other countries as the European Union."
"Do you know what this amount represents?"
"It represents practically the same amount that all the countries of the European Union spend on public investment in research, development and innovation."
"We need to change our energy dependency and reduce it, because otherwise, our economic fragility will increase."
"What do we need to do?"
"Progress has been made in the field of energy, but not the progress that we want."
"We need to permanently create an energy common market that will strengthen the whole of the Union and the Union's economy."
"There are two key elements that we need in order to do this: energy interconnections, as the expectations set out in 2002 have not been met, and a common regulatory framework to consolidate an energy common market."
"If we achieve energy interconnections in the South, East and North of Europe, if we put it forward as a major priority, giving authority to the Commission, we will see our energy dependency reduce, and we will encourage the development of renewable energy sources which, by their nature, require versatility in energy distribution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe will not become a leading player in terms of economic competitiveness until it takes definite steps to tackle all the decisive aspects of energy interconnections and the issue of a common market."
"The second main objective: in a modern society, what brings the most growth and innovation?"
"Investment in the information society and in the new technologies that have changed almost everything in the world."
"Forty per cent of the increase in productivity in the European economy is due to information and communication technologies, ICTs."
"We are leaders in this field as Europeans, because we have leading companies, but we do not have a digital internal market."
"We want to take steps to establish a digital market."
"What does this involve?"
"It involves removing barriers, it means committing to new-generation networks and facilitating e-commerce, which is growing every day in every country, but which is not making progress in terms of being possible between several countries."
"If we make progress on a digital market, we will facilitate the creation of content and strengthen intellectual property."
"We will also ensure that, thanks to the innovation that information and communication technologies bring to all areas of the economy, we will see results in terms of productivity within a very short period."
"I would like to point out that this is the sector that currently has the greatest capacity for innovation, for increasing productivity and creating stable employment."
"The third area is the economy or sustainable industry."
"I will only give you one example of what we see as a priority in the context of combating climate change."
"We want to launch and promote, along with the Commission, a plan to develop electric vehicles."
"The vehicle industry is going to undergo a major transformation, which has already begun."
"If we make an integrated commitment in this area of industry, as Europeans, to a common, shared vision and a common strategy for electric cars, we will help to reduce our energy dependency."
"We will also contribute to combating climate change and to the technological innovation that is undoubtedly going to be opened up by electric cars and will also be directly associated with the information and communication technologies industry."
"The fourth central element of this sustainable economy and economic regeneration that the European Union needs is education, especially university education, which is the forum for research."
"In the last ten years, Europe has not made progress in terms of the number of universities of excellence in the ranking of the top 100 universities."
"We need to conclude the Bologna Process."
"We need to promote, facilitate and open up expectations for increasingly European universities and increasingly European research, because they are undoubtedly the impetus for the future."
"We are no longer competing country against country, but as Europeans, as Europe, because the other players are the size of China, India, the United States and the emerging countries."
"If we do not make the most of the synergy represented by the 500 million citizens in the economy, which means tens of thousands of enterprises with huge capacity and millions of workers, who need to be provided with increasingly better training, we will not be the real leading players of the future, in terms of economic prosperity through innovation and technology, in this scenario of globalisation."
"We will be spectators, not leading players."
"The way forward is the Union: more common economic policy, more integration, more shared vision, more Europe."
"Not putting up more barriers, but removing barriers, not dividing but bringing together, having a vision of the Union that promotes competitiveness, integration and innovation."
"We have confidence in the Commission regarding this 2020 Strategy, which must also incorporate a discussion about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is a fundamental policy in terms of environmental protection, food safety and the incomes of many European citizens."
"We are convinced that the debate that is going to take place in the European Council and the Commission and, of course, the dialogue with the European Parliament, must bring about a 2020 Strategy that involves serious governance and is demanding in its objectives and focused on the areas that I have just mentioned."
"Economic change and political change, and change in the government of the Union."
"The Treaty of Lisbon establishes new institutions: the permanent President of the Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs."
"It strengthens Parliament, the heart of European democracy, and also strengthens the Commission."
"I can make a commitment before Parliament, which represents all European citizens, that the Spanish rotating Presidency will be loyal to, and will cooperate with, the new institutions."
"We want those institutions to have the meaning established in the treaty: namely, the need for the European Union to function so that the permanent President of the Council can represent the European Union and carry out all his functions, along with the High Representative."
"We are aware that this six-month period will be the first proof of how the new institutional structure works, and we will also support a strengthened Commission and Parliament, which is increasingly the political centre of the European Union."
"We are going to do this, and I hope that we will be judged satisfactorily at the end of this period, because our commitment is very firm."
"There are various powers governing the European Union, and they need to have a common thread, which is cooperative loyalty."
"That is how we shall work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are also experiencing changes in the area of external relations, not only because of the existence of the High Representative and the launch of the European External Action Service."
"There will also be changes because in this context of globalisation and change, we have a decisive six-month agenda."
"I will tell you what our objectives are in terms of external relations for all the summits that we are going to hold."
"Firstly, shared security, secondly, energy, thirdly, promoting and extending the opening up of trade and technology transfer, and fourthly, development cooperation aid, in which the European Union is a major ethical leader in the world."
"Over the next six months, we will hold a dialogue on these objectives with North and South America, in the Mediterranean, in Africa and Asia and with the other European countries that are not part of the Union."
"We will be holding a dialogue with a large proportion of the continents and areas through an intense calendar of international summits in which we will, of course, be working in full cooperation with the President of the Council and with the Commission - because we will be making important agreements during the next six months - and also with Parliament."
"Economic changes, political changes and changes in vision, in our external outlook, as a result of new players and globalisation."
"In addition to the economy, I said a few minutes ago that Europe also needs to bet on itself in the area of external policy."
"I must say that Europe needs to bet on itself, that external policy needs to take into account European interests and how to defend them."
"The matter of neighbourhood relations must be a priority."
"In my opinion, we must establish more ambitious objectives and more intense relations, because that is undoubtedly where a large proportion of European interests are going to be settled."
"The changes that we are experiencing and that we want to drive forward through reform and renewal also have a bearing upon European citizens."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, in line with the will of Europeans, wants citizens to feel closer to the European institutions."
"It wants them to see the Union as being 'their Union' and Europe as a government that is closer to them."
"In order to achieve this, there are new instruments that we are going to launch and promote in the next six months."
"The first of these is the people's legislative initiative, which is so important to Parliament."
"The second is that we want to make it a priority during this period, in cooperation with the Commission, to make progress on the most important citizens' right that the European Union can focus on, which is equality between men and women."
"The most advanced, perfect societies in which human rights and prosperity are best realised are those that achieve greater equality between men and women."
"They are the societies that are most active and committed to fighting what is represented by gender violence and mistreatment of women, which is improper and unacceptable in an advanced society such as the European Union."
"We therefore propose launching new judicial protection systems through a European protection order and maximum extension of protection against the scourge of gender violence that a large proportion of European societies suffer from."
"European citizens also need to know, based on our deliberations, our proposals and our initiatives, that social cohesion and social inclusion in response to poverty in Europe are inalienable aspects of the Union, and that, along with democracy, the most important elements of Europe's identity are welfare and social cohesion."
"The 2020 Strategy for the economy will therefore, as I said before, have to be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable."
"In order to achieve this social sustainability, I propose that we make a major new social pact in Europe between enterprises and workers, a major social pact in the development of the 2020 Strategy."
"Social dialogue and social agreement made Europe strong when it first came to be, in periods of weakness and now, in this period of renewal and change, after a serious economic crisis; social agreement - namely the social pact - could be a major driving force behind the objectives that we are setting ourselves for effective governance."
"Mr President - I am finishing now - ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to express Spain's thanks to all the countries of the European Union, especially those that promoted our integration and contributed to our development."
"I would like to reiterate our commitment to Europe and to the European Union, our commitment to a way of life, but also to a way of thinking and feeling."
"This involves thinking that favours democracy, equality, human rights, peace, and the sense that living together, uniting our peoples, uniting our aspirations and uniting our history has enabled us to live in peace with ourselves, and today and tomorrow, it can enable us to continue to live in the great region of prosperity, welfare and ideals."
"Mr President of the Spanish Government, over the next six months, Spain will assume the rotating Presidency of the Council."
"It is a country with a great European tradition and great European commitment, in its government as well as in all its political forces and in public opinion, and a President, José-Luis Rodríguez-Zapatero, whose European credentials are unquestionable."
"The institutional engines of European integration will be operating at full power once Parliament's vote of confidence in the new Commission gives these two institutions a strong, solid basis in order to move forward with an ambitious political agenda."
"I hope that the vote will take place very soon."
"First of all, at this very tragic time for Haiti, I would like to reaffirm our complete solidarity and desire to help its people and all the victims of the earthquake."
"The devastating earthquake has been at the forefront of our minds since 12 January, and efforts began straight away to provide all the assistance we can."
"The Commission is currently in a position to mobilise EUR 130 million, and the total European Union effort in terms of immediate assistance, including that of the Member States, is more than EUR 222 million, not counting civil protection assistance."
"The Commission could mobilise a further EUR 200 million in longer-term aid."
"I can assure you that the Commission and the European Union are demonstrating the values and principles of solidarity through action."
"Haiti is a Caribbean country."
"I would therefore like to highlight the fact that there is a very ambitious external relations programme for the six-month Spanish Presidency of the Council."
"I would particularly like to note that Latin America and the Caribbean are a priority for the Spanish Presidency."
"I am sure that we can count on Spain's special vocation to ensure that the summit to be held with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in Madrid in May will be a success for Latin America and for Europe."
"Let me now turn to the policy priorities for the weeks and months ahead."
"Everything points in the direction of determined and united European action."
"The failed attack on the aircraft at Detroit was a reminder that we need to act together if we are to face up to the threats to security."
"Copenhagen was a reminder that the global community does not automatically share Europe's level of ambition: as we have been doing in the G20 discussions, we need to keep driving a positive and forward-looking international process."
"Only with a united Europe can we shape globalisation."
"But we have to look at the situation of our economy."
"We all know that the European economy is at a delicate moment."
"Determined action has succeeded in preventing the worst."
"But we still face the risk that unemployment will continue to rise, and we need to make a judgment about when to switch the focus to restoring our public finances."
"At the same time, we must learn from the crisis."
"We fully realised that globalisation is a reality and that we need to use it to our advantage."
"We have demonstrated that our social protection systems have been able to respond to exceptional circumstances and by providing new safety nets."
"But we also saw the clear limits for Member States acting alone and we saw that coordinated European Union action not only brought results for Europe, but also triggered an unprecedented global response by the G20."
"Now we have to shape the right future for Europe, its economy and its society."
"The challenges we were facing before the crisis are still there, if anything, they were reinforced: how to cope with the consequences of ageing, of our demographics, how to remain competitive in a global world, how to secure the transition to a more sustainable economy, to mention just a few."
"However, I am confident in the capacities of Europe."
"I believe that an economy rebuilding its strengths has a real chance to redirect its energies."
"A society which has proved robust in the face of economic crisis is one that can build for the future with confidence."
"And a European economic system whose resilience flows from its single market, its competition rules and the euro will now need these assets as the drivers for recovery."
"I see the next six months as a springboard to set ambitious goals, goals I have presented in my political guidelines and which we debated last autumn here in the European Parliament."
"This will constitute the 'Europe 2020' strategy."
"We need a fundamental reworking of our economy to meet the challenges of the future."
"To agree on a transformation agenda, with the European Parliament, with Member States, with social partners, with societies at large."
"To offer a clear direction towards a competitive, innovative, sustainable, socially inclusive market economy, able to prosper in the global marketplace."
"Europe 2020 must offer both a mid-term vision and short-term action."
"The more we can shape our immediate measures to put us on the road to our longer-term objectives, the more we will have a head start to future growth and employment, our number one priority."
"The renewed Lisbon Strategy was able to build an understanding of how structural reform feeds directly into growth and jobs."
"But let us be frank about it: the crisis has wiped out many of the gains and there were also some shortcomings."
"The truth is that we still lag well behind our competitors on our research effort, our investment in education, our share of high tech."
"We must now use the Europe 2020 strategy to create new sources of growth, to unleash the potential of the internal market to drive our economy forward."
"That means using knowledge and creativity to generate real value in our economies, unlocking innovation and promoting its market uptake from ICTs to new energy, clean technologies, for instance."
"It means empowering people for the future with the right skills and with a labour market ready to seize the opportunities for job creation; and targeting action on the big problems, like youth unemployment."
"It is obvious that we are now facing an emergency situation from a social and unemployment point of view."
"This requires a strong focus from the European Union."
"We need to define together actions at European Union level to complement national actions with positive social impact."
"It also means an economy shaped for the future - a sustainable and resource-efficient economy - that is also productive and innovative."
"Europe's huge industrial assets need to be re-directed to seizing the first-mover advantage in tomorrow's markets."
"But Europe must be able to retain a solid, modern and competitive industrial base."
"The crisis means that, more than ever, we must use every euro of investment to best effect."
"And, of course, we must complete our reform of financial markets to put them back at the service of the economy, and not the opposite."
"This also includes our SME-friendly approach."
"SMEs are the sector which can create more jobs in the European Union and we will be doing them, and their workers, a good service if we reduce administrative burdens and apply a better and smart regulation approach."
"In our interconnected economies, we all have an interest in what is happening - at national and European Union level, from one Member State to the next."
"The present crisis shows us not only the consequences of global interdependence but also the negative effects that a specific situation in one country may have in the whole euro area."
"So, Europe 2020 must bring with it stronger coordination mechanisms, a common vision and an effective European leadership."
"I want to thank Prime Minister Zapatero for his clear commitment to this European approach when discussing economic policies, his commitment to Community matters and his commitment to the role of the European Commission in this vision and in implementation of this vision."
"Only with a European approach, a European vision and European instruments can we deliver results for our European citizens."
"This will be one of the distinctive features of Europe 2020: reinforced coordination of economic policies, in which the Commission will make full use of the new possibilities given by the treaty, including those concerning the euro area."
"This is the vision I would like to debate with you in the coming weeks, because one thing we have learnt from the Lisbon Strategy is that a European economic strategy needs the full commitment of the European political community and the social partners."
"Let us be clear: in the past, some national politicians have resisted stronger mechanisms of governance within the Lisbon Strategy."
"I hope that, following the lessons of interdependence not only at global but also at European level - all the lessons that were given to us by the crisis - all EU governments will now recognise the need for full ownership of Europe 2020 and for a truly coordinated and coherent action in economic policy, as foreseen in Articles 120 and 121 of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Finally, let me add that I see Europe 2020 also as the way to bring confidence and hope for our citizens."
"We must not hide the fact that Europe, like most of the developed world, will go through a long period of slow growth if we remain inactive."
"The phase of 'getting worse before getting better' is probably behind us, but the getting better will be slow."
"We will have to address the real problem of the economy, that the potential growth of Europe may be reduced if we do not act now in a coherent and effective manner."
"Our citizens, be they households or entrepreneurs, should feel that the European Union is part of the solution to their difficulties and anxieties."
"Europe 2020 is, for me, above all, also a response to this."
"It is to connect the European project to the concrete needs of our citizens."
"This is why I also welcome the initiative to hold an informal European Council on 11 February to have a first discussion at Head of State or Government level."
"I also think it is crucial to find opportunities to discuss these issues with this House - with Parliament - both before and after the Commission presents its outline for Europe 2020."
"That is why I have discussed this with the Council and with the President of the European Council."
"I think we should have at least a three-step approach: the informal European Council for Heads of State or Government to discuss the issue, the Spring European Council for the first important proposals and the June European Council for the approval of the guidelines, so that we will have the time to discuss this issue broadly and with a very active contribution from the European Parliament."
"I have focused today on economic policy because I see this as our number one priority in terms of urgency."
"But, of course, this does not exhaust our agenda."
"The challenges of the coming weeks and months are manifold."
"Let me just mention one of many examples: the follow-up to the Copenhagen conference on climate change."
"While we need some time to collectively reflect on the right strategic orientations for the future of the international process, we should not lower our ambition regarding commitments already made by the European Union."
"We should also intensify our efforts namely through our internal policies of promoting the upgrading and modernisation of the industrial base of our economy, the innovation and the development of new clean technologies, energy efficiency and the energy security agenda, also by putting this matter at the top of the transformational agenda for Europe."
"This is how to make the best case for the European Union on the global stage: a European Union ready for action, with a clear vision for the future and a determination to get there."
"The more we are united and effective at home, the more our case will win through internationally."
"I am very much looking forward to working with this Parliament to help make the Spanish Presidency of the Council a success and to ensure that the next six months put us on the road to realising our common ambitions for Europe, a European Union that is closer to our citizens and that is focused on clear results for our Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Barroso."
"Before I ask the leaders of the parliamentary political groups to speak, I would like, once again, to emphasise the importance of the vision presented by Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"It is a vision of development of the European Union, based on the Community method."
"Thank you, Mr Zapatero, too, for stressing the role of the European Parliament, a role which has grown significantly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it is that cooperation between the European Council, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which will be the basis of future interinstitutional structure and balance in the European Union."
"Today, we are forecasting our role for many years to come."
"Not everything is found in the treaties."
"Therefore, what happens during the Spanish Presidency is very important, because it will establish the political customs which determine the way we work, as well as the effectiveness of the European Union."
"The Spanish Presidency is of special significance, here, and I am grateful for the presentation of a vision which concurs to a large extent with that of the European Parliament."
"I would like to thank Mr Barroso for presenting the point of view of the European Commission."
"The Commission is still working with the same composition as before, but I would like to stress very strongly here: we do have a European Commission, it still is not the new Commission, but work on this is going on all the time."
"I would like especially to thank Mr Barroso for presenting the 2020 Strategy and the way it will be coordinated."
"This is a fundamental matter: how we are going to coordinate the 2020 Strategy in the future - this, too, needs to be based on the Community method."
"Now I would like to ask the leaders of the political groups for their comments and remarks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economy, the social field, climate and energy are the major priorities of the Spanish Presidency and they will rightly be the focus of Europe's attention."
"That is why Mr Van Rompuy's first decision, namely to convene a European Council dedicated to the economy and to climate change and now also, of course, to the Haiti strategy - you spoke about this issue and it is one on which I believe that Europe has to show both its heart and its know-how and you must intervene to ensure that the Council has a greater presence in Haiti - is, in my view, a positive position."
"This is why the debate that you yourself, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, launched on a possible European economic government is also welcome, despite and maybe even because of the fact that opinions currently differ on this matter."
"That is normal; we should not be frightened, ladies and gentlemen, to speak at European level of politics with a capital P, and we have to be honest with ourselves."
"We should not fear major debates, and I wish to thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for having made your contribution, because economic and social policy is the major debate, the one that is of most concern to our citizens, the one that demands our response in the short, medium and long term."
"As Mr Barroso said, this is the right time to raise the question of the economic objectives of the countries of the Union."
"It is, in fact, a matter of survival for Europe and its social model."
"Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, you know what economic difficulties are."
"They are the record unemployment of almost 20% and a public deficit of almost 11% in Spain."
"It has to be said, yours is a country that is experiencing problems."
"I therefore welcome your will to restore growth and to create employment as the be-all and end-all of your Presidency."
"To be honest though, Mr Zapatero - I said that we have to tell the truth - I am not sure that the solutions that you and the political family to which you belong are proposing in order to end the crisis and to make social Europe a reality are the most suitable."
"For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), an end to the crisis and the creation of jobs cannot be achieved by more public spending but by an economic, fiscal and environmental regime that is favourable to enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am specifically thinking of small and medium-sized enterprises where employment in our countries and in our regions is concerned."
"Social cohesion, which has been greatly tested by the crisis and by the scandals of the bonuses and rewards for the incompetence of some managers, cannot be built on small crafts, but on lasting growth that benefits the greatest number of people."
"To conclude, I wish to address the Council, whether the rotating Presidency or the permanent Presidency, to say to you formally that, with the Treaty of Lisbon, times have changed."
"The Council and Parliament must now work in close cooperation and as equals."
"This new relationship obviously requires legal standards - and for this, I put my faith in our legal experts zealously to apply the new treaty - but it also requires mutual political trust and symbolic gestures."
"In this connection, I repeat my wish for the Presidency of the Council to regularly participate in the interplay of spontaneous questions and answers with the Members of the European Parliament, as the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has been doing for several months, and as you yourself have done this morning, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"You have six months to establish this principle."
"I therefore offer my best wishes to the President-in-Office of the Council for the coming six months and hope that, together, we can succeed in moving Europe forward during this time."
"The best of luck to you."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency has an ambitious programme, which you have described to us, Mr Zapatero."
"You mentioned the four major priorities of greater energy security, more investment in information technology, more education and training and the creation of a form of European economic governance that is to ensure that these priorities can also be implemented."
"That is the right approach and it will take Europe into a new phase."
"The challenges faced by this continent are not to do with holding parliamentary sittings or arranging one summit after another."
"We have held many summits in the past."
"The summits do not solve the problems, they delineate them."
"What we need is for the solutions to the problems to actually be implemented in the Member States."
"(Applause)"
"The reactions to your proposal for economic governance indicate that this is exactly where the problem lies."
"Where did the Lisbon strategy fail?"
"It was not that it would not have been possible to implement it."
"No, it was possible to implement it."
"The Lisbon strategy failed due to the reluctance of the Member States to keep their own promises."
"This new approach, this breath of fresh air that you want to bring into European policy with this ambitious programme, is therefore the right one."
"The old structures that we have had up to now remind me somewhat of Don Quixote's beautiful horse, Rosinante, which thought it was a racehorse."
"In reality, it was an old nag."
"We will not make it into the 21st century on Rosinante."
"For this, we need new approaches and, therefore, you are on the right path."
"What Europe needs is to adopt some aspects of the Spanish model."
"The reason why - and I am saying this only once - we as Socialists specifically support you is that we believe that your government in Spain is a forward-thinking government."
"You have succeeded, in the face of a lot of opposition and with a great deal of courage, in giving your country an enormous push towards modernisation."
"You have our greatest respect for that."
"(Applause)"
"If you act at European level with the same energy and the same determination, you will also bring this modernisation drive to Europe."
"I think it is courageous for a Head of Government to say, for example, that marital violence is not a national problem but a problem that affects the whole of society everywhere and that we in Europe, in our highly developed, civilised society, must not regard violence against women as a minor offence, but as a violation of human rights, and that is what it is."
"(Applause)"
"The political re-energising that we need in Europe is tied in very strongly with our expectations of your Presidency, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"I would therefore like to add that we also need more economic control in Europe."
"I will give you an example to illustrate the fact that social cohesion gets destroyed in society because there is not enough control or not enough courage to exert control."
"When we talk about regulation of the financial markets and regulation of the banking system, we also need to mention the fact that the same banks that, a year ago, received hundreds of billions of euros in government money in order to ensure their survival, are not using this money today to give credit, but to speculate, using taxpayers' money, in order to generate soaring profits."
"That is destroying people's trust in the economic system."
"It is destroying social cohesion."
"The part of your programme that involves finally implementing the control of the financial markets is therefore an important element that we Socialists fully support."
"(Applause)"
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will give its support to your Presidency, Mr Zapatero."
"I believe that what you have presented here is an approach that brings genuine reason for hope."
"I also hope that the Commission will act with the same intensity and the same political direction as your Presidency."
"We will do whatever we can to put the Commission on the right path in the next six months and beyond, because we hope that, as a result of the 18-month long triple-shared presidencies, there will not be a completely different programme every six months, but that we will instead have continuity."
"Therefore, over the next six and the subsequent twelve months of this trio of presidencies, you will be able to count on the support of the Socialists and Democrats."
"So, I wish you good luck, Mr Zapatero."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have, in fact, two priorities for the Spanish Presidency."
"I believe you also have, in fact, two priorities."
"However many issues are raised to be solved in the coming six months, there are, we believe, two main issues."
"First of all, there is the post-Lisbon EU 2020 Strategy."
"I believe, in any case, that this name is more appropriate as, at the end of the day, the population had ceased to differentiate between the Treaty of Lisbon and the Lisbon strategies."
"This is, therefore, already a major advance."
"However we, in this House, have to be serious."
"The fundamental question is not about knowing whether there is a desire to reduce unemployment or to increase spending on innovation."
"We all agree on this."
"We agreed in 2000, we will agree in 2010, and we will agree again in 2020 and 2030."
"No, the question concerns a different issue: in short, are the Council and the Member States ready to change the method that failed in the Lisbon Strategy?"
"I am referring here to the open method of coordination, a wonderful expression, meaning that it is the Member States, not the Union, that decides, and that all that one does is compare results from the various Member States."
"It is as if the Union has become the OECD."
"That is the reality: publishing one document after another, after another."
"(Applause)"
"Already, Mr President, your initial declarations have encouraged me greatly: 'yes, we are going to change', you say."
"Things must change; we need sticks, we need carrots."
"Where needed, we must have sanctions."
"Above all, though, do not let yourself be discouraged - I say this frankly, both to you and to Mr Moratinos - by the German Minister for Economic Affairs, who did not hesitate for one second to criticise your proposals."
"It must be a good omen, though!"
"One cannot, on the one hand, say, for example, that Greece is not making enough effort, that other countries are not making enough effort and, at the same time, fail to provide the Commission and the European Union with the resources and the instruments that they need to intervene."
"It is either one thing or the other."
"One cannot have it both ways."
"I encourage you therefore to continue on this path, and I can tell you that the whole of this Parliament supports you, together with the Commission, as you confront those who continue to dismiss the need to intensify this Lisbon method."
"Well, as for my second priority, it is to attempt to find another strategy for the issue of climate change, post-Copenhagen."
"We must acknowledge that our approach failed."
"We must say it, we must recognise it."
"There is no sense in saying 'yes, but we were right, it was the right method', and so on. No, it was not the right method."
"The strategy was bad, because the result is bad."
"Therefore, the strategy has to change."
"I myself suggest that we adopt a strategy based on three components."
"The first of these components is for the European Union to appoint a climate change 'tsar' with a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the 27 Member States, unlike what happened in Copenhagen, where we had the Danish Prime Minister, the Swedish Prime Minister, the President of the Commission, Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel, yourself, Mr Brown."
"That meant that there were at least eight European political leaders who wanted to negotiate."
"There was not enough room around the table though!"
"There was scarcely room for Mr Obama even."
"There was the South African, the Brazilian, the Indian, the Chinese, then Mr Obama, and on top of that, the eight Europeans."
"How do you expect to agree a position and be heard by others in such circumstances?"
"Let us do like the WTO then; it works for the WTO."
"There, there is someone who is in charge, who negotiates for the whole of the European Union, and who produces results."
"We need the same thing at European level if we are to avoid a repeat of what happened in Copenhagen."
"(Applause)"
"Moreover, we must, I believe, be realistic."
"We must be realistic on this matter."
"We need a trilateral agreement between the United States, Europe and China."
"That must be the aim."
"All of those strategies that consist of saying 'yes, we will see', which have no allies in the United Nations, will count for nothing in tomorrow's world."
"Tomorrow's world is one of empires, and we must be an empire."
"This means that we must be at the table."
"With whom?"
"With the United States and with China."
"It is we three who need to reach an agreement; let us not start dreaming about rallying I know not how many countries around a programme."
"At the end of the day, we have to create an alliance with the United States."
"It is with the United States that we must find common ground."
"Such common ground can be found, in my view, in the emissions trading mechanism."
"We have that, and they will follow us if we can reach an agreement on it."
"That will give us common ground in order, together, to negotiate with the Chinese."
"Those, Mr President, are my two major priorities for the Spanish Presidency, and I am convinced that, with his tenacity, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero will make this a very important and very effective Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, Mr Barroso, I would like first to reply to your remark about Haiti."
"I remember that, in 2006, a European commissioner by the name of Michel Barnier proposed the creation of a European social protection force, which was to have been known as EuropeAid."
"This was during Mr Barroso's Commission."
"If we had had EuropeAid today, Europeans would already have a greater presence in Haiti."
"Mr President, take up Michel Barnier's proposal."
"You see, I am no sectarian."
"I would like now to turn to what you said about Europe's future."
"I would like to continue with another theme, which Mr Verhofstadt discussed."
"You talk of growth, but what growth?"
"What type of growth?"
"Because one of the reasons for the crises, for the environmental crisis - because there are various crises and not just one - was growth in production, which was, at the same time, destructive."
"Therefore if, at European level, we do not discuss the quality and content of growth, we will merely repeat the errors of the past."
"That is already one issue for consideration."
"The second issue we must deal with concerns what you said about growth and a pact, for example, against energy dependence."
"One of the pillars of the fight against energy dependence is energy saving."
"We in Europe must develop a major pact for European investment in energy saving."
"The environment is about energy savings, it is about billions in investment and, at the same time, it is about creating jobs."
"So do not forget: renewables, yes, but renewables with energy savings."
"And on this matter, I ask that the European Union decides now, not to make 20%, but rather 30% in energy savings by 2020."
"We can do it, if we want to."
"Now to the second issue; you spoke about electric cars."
"Very well!"
"However, there is another consideration."
"Mobility is not just about cars."
"There is a major project that could be developed in Europe."
"You had Airbus, you have the TGVs."
"Why not develop a major European tramways project?"
"Throughout Europe, there is a need for renovation and modernisation of tramways, in central Europe, in the south, in Latin America, everywhere in fact."
"This is a source of employment, and there is a part of the car industry that you will be unable to save."
"In this way, you will be able to give it another mobility-related function."
"A European tramways project is also a solution to the climate problems linked to traffic."
"On a different note, you rightly spoke of education and the Bologna process."
"Fine!"
"The problem with the Bologna process, though, is that it has been diverted from its original purpose."
"Instead of making a Europe of equal higher education, higher education in Europe has been turned into school education, where universities are no longer places of research and reflection, but learning factories."
"Curricula have been created that students are unable to follow."
"If, therefore, you wish to pursue the Bologna process, we first need to take a step back and call into question all of the curricula which are linked to the Bologna process."
"The response can be seen on the streets of university cities throughout Europe, where students are protesting not against the idea of a European education, but against the deterioration in higher education ostensibly in the name of a European idea."
"I would like to end on your European social pact."
"A European social pact and a social and environmental pact."
"Bring the companies, bring the unions and bring the major environmental associations around a table."
"Social protection will not work without environmental protection."
"That is the new idea, and, for the Members on the right, this is one of the good ideas that Mr Sarkozy in France had; it was called the Grenelle, or round table, on the environment."
"I believe it is time to have a Brussels for the environment, bringing all of the social partners and the major representatives of the environmental organisations together around one table."
"If you go down that path, we will be in agreement, and Europe is the solution."
"As for the instruments, we shall have to develop them together."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I am happy at this crucial time in the work of the European Union that Spain takes on the Presidency of the Council."
"Along with Greece and Portugal, Spain's membership of the European Community was an early example of the way in which Europe could help encourage and support a new democracy - a path followed successfully by many others since 1989."
"Spanish Members from all parties have made important contributions to the work of this House, holding distinguished office in both Parliament and in our groups."
"Their impact has been substantial and, in this context, I would like to pay particular tribute to our friend, Jaime Mayor Oreja, one of Parliament's most influential personalities."
"The Presidency starts at a critical time for the European Union and I wish it well, but I confess I have misgivings."
"It stumbled in its first few days in office."
"The suggestion that, rather than simply coordinating plans for economic development, the European Union should be able to establish compulsory economic policies with sanctions or corrective action against Member States who do not comply is deeply disturbing."
"It reflects a very old-fashioned socialist command-and-control approach to economic policy which is not relevant to solving the problems of the 21st century."
"Without interfering in the politics of Spain, there is a saying in the United Kingdom which suggests that you put your own house in order first."
"Socialism does not do that."
"What we do need are economic policies that respect the rights of our Member States, stimulate the sharing of best practice and focus on delivering EU added value; policies which defend the benefits of the internal market and extend them further; policies which provide a climate in which entrepreneurs and businesses can thrive in order to create jobs, raise our standard of living and contribute to a stronger society."
"We in the ECR Group have high hopes of the Europe 2020 initiative as a framework for a sustainable, competitive European economy, and we have drafted our own additional proposals which we hope will help to take this debate forward."
"I would like to touch on foreign policy."
"I know that this has been given some prominence in the Presidency's programme, but I must speak about one issue which is mentioned, but without enough emphasis in my view."
"That issue is Iran."
"Its illegitimate, brutal and dangerous government must be dealt with firmly."
"If we are serious about nuclear non-proliferation, the Iranian Government must understand that, whilst Iran has the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, it will not be allowed to deceive the world in pursuing its ambition of having nuclear weapons."
"A regime which resorts to murder and violence to oppress its own people, a people cheated of a government of their choice, simply cannot be trusted, and we must take action."
"The Spanish Presidency takes office with a full agenda."
"Our group will judge its proposals and initiatives on their merits."
"If it proposes progressive policies to stimulate economic growth, to deal with climate change, to strengthen individual freedom and responsibility, and to encourage cooperation on the world stage where we share common interests, all of these are areas where Europe can offer a benefit rather than impose a burden."
"If it does that, then it will have our support."
"Welcome, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"Unfortunately, my group feels that your programme does not resolve the fundamental problems."
"In our view, the fundamental requirement of this Presidency would have been to rectify the current economic policy, through public intervention in the economy and, of course, by regulating the market through progressive fiscal policies."
"The recession in Spain and in Europe, and the unemployment figures, the like of which have not been seen since the 1930s, are the consequence of not intervening in the market and not intervening in strategic production sectors, including the financial sector."
"From this perspective, unfortunately, there is nothing new in your programme."
"Income from employment is being punished and capital gains income is being favoured, because there is no harmonisation in fiscal policies and, as part of what is meant by the liberalisation of services, the European social model is being dismantled."
"Articles 43 and 49 of the treaty protect a model that favours the market and the freedom of the market as opposed to workers' rights and, as you are well aware, we already have European Court judgments legalising social dumping."
"This is the actual reality."
"Therefore, unfortunately this part of your programme, which for us is substantial, does not change or alter anything and does not introduce anything new."
"In other words, it contradicts the slogan that you have used for the Spanish Presidency: 'Innovating Europe'."
"On this specific point, there is no innovation."
"There is continuity, due to the election of Mr Barroso, which we opposed - although you, of course, gave him your support - and we think that this continuity is damaging to the European model."
"On foreign policy, we do not agree that we need to increase military capacity."
"The images of the disaster in Haiti where combat helicopters and marines are being deployed are damaging to us."
"They are damaging!"
"This is not what is needed when there are disasters such as the one in Haiti."
"We need civil protection."
"We need doctors, architects and people to relieve the pain of the tragedy."
"Finally, Mr Zapatero, the summit with Morocco."
"We do not agree with the advanced status of Morocco while the Saharan people are not allowed to exercise their right to self-determination and they are permanently under persecution, I repeat, permanently under persecution from the Moroccan authorities."
"We do not agree with this summit."
"We believe that there should be a European summit regarding the right to self-determination of the Saharan people."
"With regard to the State of Israel, we need to be much stricter in the Neighbourhood Policy and ensure that Article 2 of this Association Agreement as part of the Neighbourhood Policy is complied with, because Israel is systematically failing to comply with international law."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, thank you."
"Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I have listened with attention to your proposals for the Spanish Presidency, and I can only wish you luck."
"I will now refer to a reality."
"I represent the south-east of England, and many of my constituents - together with other European citizens - have been suffering urbanisation abuses on the Mediterranean coast and in other parts of Spain for a long time now."
"Three reports have been adopted by this Parliament urging the Spanish authorities to take action but, other than the conviction of a few politicians and the passing of a new Land Law, no specific action has been taken to defend the people who are suffering prejudice."
"The problems my constituents face range from the dramatic situation of Len and Helen Prior of Berkshire, who saw their house being demolished because the authorities said it was built in breach of coastal law, to cases like that of Doreen Snook, also from Berkshire, in Alicante, and Mr Lohmann in Lanzarote, who cannot actually live in the houses they have purchased because of the lack of proper infrastructure and services."
"As a national of Spain, I am ashamed to see what is going on in my country."
"I have big concerns for the future of the Spanish tourism business now that the press is writing about the bad fortune of these people."
"(ES) Mr Zapatero, I will now address you in your mother tongue, which is also my own."
"The people affected are not people of great wealth, they are simply people who have used the fruits of their labours to buy a house in this country with its mild climate and good people, a place to live when they retire."
"These people are unfairly having to pay fees to lawyers and other experts in order to defend themselves in the courts, without much chance of success."
"The European Union has been convincing its population that it is there to maintain peace in Europe."
"Is this situation I describe going to bring peace to Europe?"
"You are telling us that you are going to get Europe out of the crisis."
"If you cannot solve the problem I am referring to, how much credibility can you have in solving Europe's financial crisis?"
"Mr Zapatero, we want a solution now."
"We want the people to be able to live in the houses they bought."
"If this is not possible, they need to be granted a fair compensation that allows them to buy a similar property."
"This Parliament has only threatened to block payments of subsidies to Spain, but I can assure you that, if this situation is not resolved during the Spanish Presidency, I will do everything I can to turn this threat into action."
"(ES) I am delighted to be in this very special forum with the President of the Spanish Government, someone whom I have valued very highly since the time when he was a strong law student."
"I think that by chance, the rotating Presidency of the European Union has given my country the best possible opportunity to demonstrate once again that Spain wants to play a decisive role in Europe."
"As the President said, joining Europe was a dream for the people of Spain during the long years of the dictatorship."
"We are therefore especially happy to be here and we relish the experience, because we know, ladies and gentlemen, that this Union of Member States which we represent here is the only answer to the problems that the world faces, since traditional States are incapable of finding effective solutions."
"It is very important for Europe to find its place by defining itself and defending the values that it created in the cradle of revolutions, in the books written by its brilliant minds, and in the cries of its peoples."
"Those values are freedom, the rule of reason, laicism and solidarity."
"I therefore know, Mr President, that you want to make the most of this opportunity to put the Treaty of Lisbon into practice."
"I agree with the objectives that you have proposed, although some of them are vague and also do not manage to distinguish matters which are incidental from those which are fundamental."
"One of the objectives, which concerns climate change, makes me think that the European policy implemented by the Commission is the right one, even though it failed in Copenhagen."
"What is important is that the waste of so many nations has to stop, because billions of earth's inhabitants should not have to suffer the consequences of the selfishness of rich societies."
"I would also place more emphasis on defending human rights in the world."
"When the European Union is accused of being a bureaucratic organisation with no soul, people forget that its soul is our Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In this respect, I believe that the Spanish Presidency should involve itself in the following matters: it should not hold the Morocco Summit until Morocco commits to complying with the resolutions made regarding the Sahara by the United Nations, a body that you have invoked on other occasions."
"In Cuba and Iran, you should promote joint action for the recognition of the organisations that oppose the governments, in line with the debate that took place here yesterday."
"If rights are our soul, the soul of Europe, I will venture to remind you that you place a great emphasis, as you rightly said in your speech, on the backbone of Europe being a common energy policy."
"Without this, everything is held back and even international policy runs the risk of evaporating like smoke."
"Finally, I would like to remind you not to forget your commitment to giving the cities of Ceuta and Melilla status similar to that of the most remote regions."
"I will conclude: esteemed President Zapatero, my dear friend José Luis, I wish you every success for the good of this strong, federal Europe in which we both believe."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to express my thanks for the tone and content of the speeches that have been made on behalf of the various parliamentary groups this morning."
"I will talk about the most important matters, starting with Mr Daul."
"Thank you for your words regarding this positive drive for economic governance, the common economic policy."
"You raised the question as to what is the objective of such economic governance, of such an economic policy, or, if you will pardon the expression, offered an ideological foray into the possible postulates of a social democratic idea or project."
"In particular, I heard you express your reticence regarding indiscriminate increases in public spending and your preference for an environment that is favourable to enterprises."
"I would like to clarify something."
"It has little to do with my speech, but a great deal to do with my political convictions."
"I am a strong supporter of the Stability Pact."
"I am a strong supporter of fiscal balance throughout the cycle."
"This is so much the case that in its first four years, before the economic and financial crisis, the government of which I was and still am the President had a surplus in its public accounts and decreased its deficit to 32% of GDP."
"I am therefore a convert."
"Deficit and surplus are tools, depending on the economic cycle."
"Now I, like the majority of European governments, have been in favour of responding with a fiscal stimulus that results in a public deficit, and public spending has increased slightly because private investment slowed down."
"This is not an ideological problem."
"It is a problem of reality."
"The financial crisis meant that private investment and private credit froze and was halted."
"It seems reasonable that the only way to compensate in some way for this slowdown in the economy was through public stimulus."
"This needs to be corrected, as far as circumstances allow, and we need to return to the Stability Pact."
"Like other countries, my country is going to have, and in fact it does have, a large public deficit."
"I can also assure you, however, that my country is going to fulfil its commitment to the Commission for 2013 and return to the path of stability implied by a 3% deficit."
"In order to achieve this, as the Commission knows, we have an austerity plan, a strict fiscal consolidation plan."
"It is strict in terms of our public accounts, and we will put it into practice."
"I agree that we need to create an environment that is favourable to enterprises, economic activity, initiative and competition."
"In fact, in my speech, I strongly advocated a common energy market and a European digital market."
"This means nothing more than promoting economic freedom, initiative and trade between Europeans in the field of energy and promoting competition because it reduces prices and promotes technological innovation."
"In the digital field, which I have focused on a great deal here today, we are largely betting on the future, insofar as we promote e-commerce and the transfer of all the products being generated currently in communication technologies, which represent a growing percentage of gross domestic product."
"Our proposal, and our plan, therefore, is for the 2020 Strategy to favour a Europe without trade barriers, to favour competition, innovation and an entrepreneurial environment in Europe."
"What governments also need to do, as far as possible, is not to correct the environments behind business activity, but they do need to intervene in order to correct the environments that have favoured speculation, either financial speculation or property speculation."
"This is something different."
"Sometimes, due to particular ideas, speculation is promoted, intentionally or unintentionally, in the financial field or the property field."
"Spain has been a victim of this, as have some citizens, not only British citizens."
"This is the will of the government, within its scope of competence."
"You should be aware that in Spain, there is a distribution of competence, which lies not only with the central government, but also with the autonomous communities and the councils."
"There are, of course, laws and judicial proceedings, but I am very aware of what you have said, and we will therefore act."
"Therefore: an economic environment that is favourable to business activity, initiative and innovation, but which is not favourable to financial and property speculation."
"Of course, I am in favour of reasonable fiscal pressure, and I do not represent any opposing model, because while I have been in government, I have reduced tax on businesses, income tax on workers and personal taxation."
"I am in favour, on the basis of an interventionist perspective, of what is represented by its philosophy on taxation and the fiscal position."
"Finally, I want to say to Mr Daul that I note the position of his group, which is the majority group in this House, regarding the role of the President of the Council - the permanent President - and of Parliament."
"I think this is an important matter."
"I am in favour of all the European institutions, the great European institutions, having a fluid relationship with Parliament."
"Of course, insofar as we want to make Europe bigger, we need to move towards a more powerful Parliament."
"That is my opinion."
"Mr Schulz, thank you for your words."
"I am convinced that the principles of the European Union have a great deal to do with the principles of social democracy, and that social democracy has been a major lever behind the construction of the European idea and European ideals."
"I would like to affirm - despite the force of other ideas, which have had many problems in terms of application - our commitment to a vision of social cohesion, a vision in which it is essential for democracy to be social in nature."
"Mr Verhofstadt, I am extremely grateful for your words."
"I agree with practically everything you said."
"With regard to coordination and the failure of Lisbon, open coordination failed."
"We are aware of this."
"We revised it in 2004, and now either we take it seriously or, in 2020, we will once again be saying that it did not work."
"Government requires a Community method."
"I do not know why some of you are surprised by the words 'sanctions' or 'requirements'."
"There are many decisions in the workings of the European Union that involve sanctions."
"If directives are not complied with, if the Stability Pact is not complied with, it is natural that there should be sanctions."
"Also, it works."
"What Parliament needs to be clear about, because the European Union needs to be clear about it, is that the things that we have done together are producing good results."
"These are things such as the euro, the Stability Pact and the internal market, which needs to be developed and deepened, because it is one of the major levers for growth and competitiveness."
"I completely agree with what you proposed regarding Copenhagen and the subsequent strategy, the new strategy."
"I think that it is an interesting initiative for there to be a High Authority for this issue, and it is true that Copenhagen did not produce the results that we would have wanted."
"It is true that Europe held a positive position, but that was not the result."
"Mr Meyer, with all due respect, there are some things that we do not agree on."
"Of course, aside from the fact that the European Union does not have competence, for example, in fiscal policy, I did not present a conservative programme, but rather a programme of reforms."
"It is, above all, a programme to save time in the future, to anticipate the future, which, in my view, is the best way to move forward with a progressive programme."
"A progressive programme is one which sees changes, one which anticipates them and is capable of innovating."
"I hope and trust that the European Union will keep in step with this."
"I respect your position on Morocco, but I do not share it."
"North Africa, especially Morocco, is of strategic importance to the European Union."
"Let us ensure that its modernisation process moves forward through dialogue and cooperation, and let us leave the arbitration of the Sahara conflict to the right body, which is the United Nations, which is taking steps which Spain naturally supports and respects."
"Regarding Haiti, it is true that we frequently see helicopters or fighter planes promoting conflicts and bombarding areas of the planet, and they have a difficult place in our conscience."
"It is often difficult for our conscience and our convictions, but I must say that for me personally, seeing helicopters and marines bringing food, bringing order and saving lives is something worthy of applause."
"(Applause)"
"For me personally, it is something worthy of applause."
"If Europe does have a rapid action force, as I hope we shall, I would be in support of Mr Barnier's proposal."
"As has been said here, it will have to have civil and military components, to enable us to take effective action in the shortest possible time, with the resources that we have available."
"I have taken note of your suggestions, Mrs Andreasen."
"Of course, I would like to confirm to the representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that I agree with many of the suggestions that you made in your speech."
"In the whole of my speech, I talked about sustainable growth, environmentally sustainable growth."
"I agree with you that the electric vehicle is, or should be, something that promotes another mode of transport."
"I note your suggestion that in the Social Pact, the dimension of environmental sustainability should be an essential dimension, and I do, of course, have a deeply-held conviction that the future of innovation, competitiveness and productivity lies in the so-called 'green economy'."
"It also lies in the potential of communication technologies and, of course, in a common or single vision of energy, as Mr Sosa Wagner said, as this is central to the future of the European Union's existence."
"Mr Kirkhope, I agree with what you said about the relevance of the personality of my compatriot, Mr Mayor Oreja, but I do not agree with you that there was any suggestion whatsoever of more control or of more centralisation in what is represented by the ideas, the initiatives and the political proposal that I put forward in this House."
"No, it is a political initiative so that the internal market might be bigger and cover more fields, and for there to be more competitiveness and more innovation."
"It is for us to join forces."
"Joining forces does not mean controlling, uniting does not mean leading."
"On the contrary, joining forces is more democratic, uniting promotes cooperation."
"What I think would be even more negative would be for us to continue operating 27 small, centralised control systems since, in a globalised world, this would mean that the players competing with us that have internal markets and common policies, such as the United States, China and India, would have us at a disadvantage."
"We will see that, in a very short space of time, if we do not make this major change as Europeans, and implement this new, more Community-oriented economic policy, India or China will catch up with us in terms of production and innovation."
"No, we have no interest - if you will allow me to say so, with all due respect - no interest in control or interventionism."
"That is not what we are debating."
"When we talk about 2020 and government, we are talking about our collective capacities, the sum of the synergies represented by 500 million citizens on a continent that has succeeded in generating and launching the industrial revolution, the best use of energy and the greatest scientific advances."
"If all these forces are joined, we will have the capacity to play a leading role, to maintain our economic model, our prosperity model and our welfare model."
"These are the objectives."
"Of course - I completely agree - I believe that the European Union has a clear position regarding Iran."
"Iran must comply with international rules and the international community - and, of course, the European Union needs to assert the requirement for Iran to comply with international rules regarding nuclear proliferation."
"I share your concern and your feelings on this subject."
"Mr Sosa Wagner, I am happy to be here with you in this forum, in this great institution, at this time and in this debate."
"I have taken note of your suggestions."
"I fully agree with what you said about energy, which was largely the focus of my speech."
"It is largely energy that is going to define the European Union's capacity to be a great continent, both politically and economically."
"Undoubtedly, insofar as we have more energy interconnections and less energy dependency, we will be stronger economically and politically."
"As we are well aware, energy has determined the course of history."
"It has determined how certain powers have dominated other countries."
"This has been through the control and use of energy but, of course, now it is also about saving energy."
"The European Union promotes a policy, just as it will continue to promote for the next six months, of defending fundamental rights."
"It does so intelligently and by seeking to ensure progress is made where we have the expectation and the hope that it is possible."
"It does so where we feel that offering our hand is better than closing the door."
"We will therefore maintain the summit with our neighbour, Morocco."
"We will, at all times, promote the defence of human rights."
"All in all, Mr President, I am extremely grateful for what has been said by all the spokespeople for the different parliamentary groups."
"I would like to express my respect for all their positions."
"I am taking note of the more direct, specific issues that have been raised in relation to my country, which I represent with the utmost pride given what we have achieved in the 25 years during which we have been part of the European Union."
"I also represent my country with the utmost humility, because we are here to share, and I think that the best way of sharing is to come with humility, to come prepared to unite, to join together and to defend the great ideal of the European Union together."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I believe that there has been general consensus on the priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, with, of course, some nuances depending on the stance of the various political groups, but there is one issue which has figured in several speeches and to which I wish to refer, namely the question of European coordination, or consistency, whether it be in our response to natural disasters outside Europe, or in our response within the framework of external relations, for example post-Copenhagen, or in relation to economic policy."
"And on that matter, I believe that we have a solution, which is to apply the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We do not have to go very far."
"As for our response to humanitarian crises, we have the famous Barnier report, which has already been mentioned today."
"This is a report that I and the rotating Presidency at the time, the Austrian Presidency, requested from your fellow Member of Parliament and my good friend, Michel Barnier."
"He was not a commissioner at that time, and it was on my own initiative that I asked him to draft this report."
"We received this report, which had my support and that of the then Presidency of the Council."
"Thereafter, it was not applied because the Council did not wish to apply it; let us be clear on that."
"This is why we must do more on the issue of consistency in the European Union's external humanitarian action."
"Now, I believe that the answer lies in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We have a High Representative who is the Vice-President of the Commission and, at the same time, Chair of the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"This is why, in the new Commission, I have created a new 'International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response' portfolio."
"This will be a commissioner, in this case, probably a female commissioner, for whom this will be the first task and who will need to work in tandem with the High Representative and with the Council so that we may, one day, I trust, have a true external service, but also competences in the area of crisis response and civil protection."
"That is all on the first question."
"The second question concerns international negotiations, for example, in the wake of Copenhagen."
"Here again, I have to read out the Treaty of Lisbon, because I believe many people have not read it."
"Article 17: 'With the exception of the common foreign and security policy, and other cases provided for in the treaties, it shall ensure the Union's external representation'."
"It is henceforth the Commission that represents the Union in foreign affairs, not the European Council."
"Without doubt, there will be Heads of State or Government who will represent their own countries."
"Who, though, represents the Union in foreign affairs, except for the CFSP?"
"The Commission."
"This is why I created a climate agenda portfolio and thus hope that the commissioner, in this case, a female commissioner, will, in future, have all the support required to represent the Union in the post-Copenhagen negotiations."
"Let us be clear on this point too."
"The third question concerns economic policy."
"Here, too, the Treaty of Lisbon has to be read."
"There are those who think that economic policy is a purely national matter."
"That is not the case."
"Article 120: 'The Member States regard their economic policies as a matter of common interest and coordinate them in the Council'."
"Article 121(2): 'The Council shall, on a recommendation from the Commission, formulate a draft for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and of the Union, and shall report its findings to the European Council', and, further on - you have to read the full article - 'In order to ensure closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of the economic performances of the Member States, the Council shall, on the basis of reports submitted by the Commission, monitor economic developments in each of the Member States and in the Union'."
"There is, therefore, joint monitoring."
"Beyond that, and this is something new in the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission may now make concrete recommendations, especially, and I quote: 'Where it is established that the policies of a Member State are not consistent with the broad guidelines or that they risk jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, the Commission may address a warning to the Member State concerned'."
"And further on: 'The Council, on a recommendation from the Commission, may address the necessary recommendations to the Member State concerned'."
"This is very interesting, though, because Parliament, too, will have powers in this context: 'The President of the Council and the Commission shall report to the European Parliament on the results of multilateral surveillance'."
"In other words, henceforth, we have the mechanisms in the Treaty of Lisbon - there is no need to invent anything new ..."
"(Comment made off-microphone)"
"No, yes, of course, I have already done it."
"I do not need to have your support to say it ..."
"And the truth is that we have, in the Treaty of Lisbon, if we truly wish to apply it, the instruments that we need to guarantee coordination and consistency, with no need for political or ideological divisions on this issue."
"This is my point - and this is why I must stress it here today: this is the first time that we have had a new rotating Presidency of the Council at the European Parliament."
"The Spanish Presidency has a great responsibility."
"This is the first time since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force that we have had a rotating Presidency."
"Furthermore, as Mr Zapatero has said - and he has my full confidence because of his commitment to Europe - I believe that we have a responsibility to apply the treaty in both letter and spirit."
"Both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon are very clear."
"A stronger Europe!"
"A stronger Europe, not for the sake of the institutions, but so that the institutions are better able to serve the real interests of our citizens."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Barroso."
"We have all read the Treaty of Lisbon, and we know it does not say everything."
"This is why it is so important that, working together, we establish an interpretation of what the Treaty of Lisbon does say, and that, together, we plan our work in the European Union for many years to come."
"(ES) Mr President of the Spanish Government, I would like to say to you that we are not living in just another period, we are not living in just any moment in and for the European Union."
"What you and Chair Daul said is true: the European Union and the European people know that their main concern is the crisis."
"It also needs to be pointed out here today, however, that before the economic crisis, in various elections in which there was a low turnout, Europeans were also showing signs of a growing disinterest and distance from the European institutions."
"Therefore, the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the European integration project."
"I want to say this to you because, in view of the obvious impetus which will be provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, we have our first opportunity to reduce this rift between the European people and the European institutions."
"We are therefore living - or at least we should be living - in a period of transition and of change, which you referred to."
"I would like to say, however, that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distanced from European policy."
"Transitions are always an opportunity."
"They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans."
"I would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the European institutions, in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments, in politicians, is undoubtedly much more important than the Treaty of Lisbon itself."
"It is not enough for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force in order for us to be able to talk about transition and change in the European Union and ambition in the European project."
"I therefore want to say to you that the prime ambition is for Europeans to understand us better, as they do not understand us."
"Our language is unintelligible and, at times, incomprehensible, and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself, so that we can move closer to the European people."
"We need to devote much more time, much more political energy and much more political impetus to ensuring that Europeans can understand us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, all the presidencies are going to be distinct, different and more demanding, and they are going to demand more sacrifice and more generosity from us than ever."
"I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union."
"What we need to do now is to apply them in the right way."
"I am going to tell you how the Spanish Presidency should not be measured."
"It is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold."
"The measure of a good Presidency is not conventional speeches or great words, or common places."
"It will be measured by the results, the realities, our capacity to change our attitude - in all the European institutions - and our capacity to prioritise the real problems that Europeans have."
"This will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all Europeans."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) On behalf of the Socialist delegation in this European Parliament, which, as you said, is the European parliament with the most extensive representation and democratically the strongest in the whole history of the European Union, I would like to join in extending an extremely warm welcome to the Spanish President of the European Union, and express my best wishes for success at such a crucial time."
"It is a crucial time owing to the entry into force, finally, of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is also crucial given the launch of the new institutions: the new Commission, the permanent President of the Council and the High Representative of the European Union."
"Above all, however, it is crucial because it gives us an opportunity to do what needs to be done by means of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new institutions, which is to respond to the most serious and most severe crisis that we have seen for 80 years, which has had a serious economic, financial but also social impact."
"For 10 years, European citizens have been watching an institutional debate, and on 7 June, citizens elected this Parliament, which represents 500 million people."
"Those people are watching us, they have expectations of us and they are demanding answers from us."
"They want coordination and monitoring where there was a lack of governance and, in response to a lack of transparency and greed, they want the ethics of responsibility to be restored."
"What they therefore want is for us to emerge from the crisis and to emerge better, but true to our model."
"I therefore believe that the Spanish Presidency is right to start by reaffirming values: the importance of equality."
"The European Union is built on equality, equality before the law, but also equality as the backbone of the social model, combating exclusion and discrimination, protecting the weakest in society, a commitment to combating gender violence and to the European protection order."
"It is also built on quality as a lever for the future in innovation, education and training, which have always been a way of opening up new opportunities for those who do not currently have them."
"In addition to this, the Presidency is right in terms of content, and it has referred to the importance of the 2020 Strategy, which recognises that the Lisbon Strategy did not work, and therefore we are not happy or satisfied and that we need to commit to more innovation and better energy sources."
"There is also the European External Action Service, to make a difference in Haiti, and the action plan for the area of freedom, security and justice."
"If you will allow me, I would like to say that it is also right in its attitude and in having the courage to promote change in the face of national prejudices and in the face of the decline or the resignation..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) President of the rotating Presidency, Mr Zapatero, I sincerely wish you luck and success, as this will be good for Europe and for its citizens."
"The crisis necessitates global thinking and local action, but you need to join forces with everyone."
"Make use of successful local and regional models, those based on the real economy, collaboration between the public and private sectors and proximity to the people."
"Include the regions, build decision-making processes with them."
"This also means applying the Treaty of Lisbon, which gives them a role for the first time."
"Your programme forgets the regions and does not clarify how the subsidiarity protocol will be applied."
"Take risks, innovate, but earn some credibility, because no one here believes what you say after Spain reduced its budgets for innovation."
"I am pleased that you back equality between men and women, but your programme is written in a masculine form, the language does not even address the perspective of gender."
"Does this not seem a bad symptom?"
"As far as the Basque Country is concerned, work for peace, give support to the productive economy, push forward the Basque high speed train, and integrate our fiscal system, our police and our language into the European institutions."
"Europe will be built by bringing together people, knowledge, will and political reality."
"That means Parliament, to which, if I may say, you have brought your programme and timetable poorly and too late, and which merits a level of respect which I have not seen, even at the Official Opening on 8 January."
"(ES) Prime Minister, welcome."
"I fear, however, that your Presidency runs the risk of being regarded as a political crocodile, that is to say, with a big mouth, expressing big ideas, but which ultimately has no ears to listen with."
"Nothing would please me more, I promise you, than to be able to congratulate you in six months time for having put in place measures which enable us to emerge from the crisis - something which effectively implies greater and better economic government - and for having reorganised the European Union from a social, ecological and democratic point of view."
"However, today I must confess my concern about the fact that in the Presidency Programme, the aims for stimulation plans, for example, are uncertain and references to economic government of the Union are marginal."
"Furthermore, in order to tackle a real fiscal reform, which includes European resources in order to form social policy and which clearly has a green, ecological dimension, we need to make it very clear that those who pollute must pay, and that this also applies to those who behave in a fraudulent and irresponsible manner, whether they are a bank, a multinational or a tax evader."
"However, I also see timidity in your proposals and too many concessions to those who shamelessly mortgage our social and environmental present and future."
"Nevertheless, it is certain that there are many summits planned during your Presidency, be they with Latin America or the Mediterranean, but I also wish to show my concern on two aspects."
"The first is your decision to revise universal jurisdiction, since this weakens us when faced with genocide and universal criminals, whether they be in Israel, China or Guatemala, and the second is where, in cases such as the Sahara or Columbia, for example, among many others, trade agreements take precedence over the defence of human rights."
"I wish to finish, however, by congratulating you and giving you my support on one particular matter, that of equality between men and women."
"Yes, there, I give you credibility, there, I see potential, there, I believe you can do fundamental work, because you have earned it in many areas."
"I hope and I trust - and you will have the support of this Chamber in continuing to do so - that you continue to set an example to many other countries which are very behind in this respect."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, your country has taken over the Presidency at an exceptionally difficult time - the last, I hope, phase of the worst economic crisis to hit our continent for 80 years."
"Therefore, it is fully understandable that you have made returning to a path of economic development and the fight against unemployment your main priorities for the next six months."
"However, if you are talking about a growth in competitiveness of the European economy, we must remember that this cannot be achieved without reform of the economy and without completion, for example, of building the common market, or without fighting against the revival, for example in France, of economic nationalism."
"I am glad that the matter of energy security has also been included in Spain's priorities."
"Mr Zapatero, I come from Poland, which understands better than most countries the need to diversify the supply of materials used for power generation, and that means diversification of the sources of supply and not only the channels of distribution, as lobbyists working for the Russian firm Gazprom are trying to convince us."
"I hope that in six months' time, you will be able to show some real successes in this area, too."
"Finally, the matter of EU enlargement, which Mr Moratinos rightly recognised recently as a matter of fundamental importance."
"We are debating, today, at a moment when our important neighbour, Ukraine, which is also an important neighbour from the point of view of energy security, has just passed its next examination in democracy."
"I hope that in six months' time, we will be able to say that Ukraine is closer to membership of the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, the Spanish Presidency, in describing the priorities for consumers, devotes a total of two lines to the governance programme."
"That is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection."
"We therefore wonder what the Presidency is intending to do about the rights of its citizens."
"Does it intend to safeguard them by revising the proposed full harmonisation downwards or to restrict the commitments announced?"
"The lack of vision in the social sector is not limited solely to consumers."
"Unemployment as a consequence of the recent crisis is hitting citizens of the Union hard and they are waiting for action to be taken."
"Young people in particular are in a quagmire."
"In response, the Presidency is promoting the employability of young people through apprenticeship schemes, thereby exacerbating their exploitation and the excessive profits of undertakings."
"We call on the Spanish Presidency to revise its programme so as to safeguard permanent jobs for its citizens."
"(LT) I also hope that the Spanish Presidency will be a success and that, in addition to the priorities laid out, Spain will also devote attention to a problem that is particularly relevant these days, that of human rights and freedoms."
"Following an investigation carried out by the Lithuanian Parliament into CIA prisons, it came to light that in another state, a European state, the infrastructure had been established for the illegal imprisonment of people."
"The European Union and the United States of America are like two cornerstones of global politics and economics, allies and partners enjoying equal rights, but this does not mean that CIA agents are entitled to play the master in sovereign states in our own backyard."
"I think that the European Parliament should renew its investigation into the illegal rendition of people and their imprisonment in European states."
"The conclusions of this investigation should crown a document obliging Member States to ensure the rights and freedoms of every citizen without condition."
"(NL) The Spanish Presidency's statements on immigration policy, and border controls in particular, blow hot and cold very curiously."
"In particular, Spain's creed that such matters should be regulated at European level rings very hollow in view of the country's recent mass legalisation of illegal immigrants; of which the - shall we say - more northerly European countries, too, will soon pay the price without ever having a say in the matter."
"It also struck me that the Spanish Presidency is continuing to advocate an active immigration policy at a time of very serious economic crisis, when no one knows how many million Europeans are unemployed."
"What we really need is to close our borders, put a real stop to immigration and, of course, provide economic support to countries that need it."
"The further large-scale immigration you are advocating can only lead to large-scale problems."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I must compliment you on your eloquence."
"However, what do you really have to say?"
"What is your message to us?"
"What is the substance of what you said?"
"I have heard many speeches - you are the 32nd Head of Government that I have witnessed - but I have rarely heard anything so non-committal in content."
"In view of the crisis, the forthcoming summit, the necessary stringency of financial market regulation and the fact that the Council has left the Commission to its own devices over the last few months, where is your strategy?"
"Mr Schulz must have been in a different room if he is recommending that we adopt your Spanish Government model here."
"I would like to make one thing clear: Europe cannot afford a 20% unemployment rate."
"What is so good about this Spanish model then?"
"How have you responded to the crisis?"
"How can you coordinate things here?"
"We call for your leadership."
"Then we will support you."
"However, what can we do with something so non-committal?"
"Of course we are opposed to marital violence, who would not be?"
"Your only concrete proposal was the electric car - and with the crisis and the summit in mind - is that all you can come up with, Mr Zapatero?"
"I am also amazed by the fact that the President of the Commission had to read the Treaty to you with regard to economic policy coordination, and you listened very attentively because it was clearly the first time that you had heard it!"
"All I can say to you is that you should follow the recommendations of your fellow party member, Mr Almunia."
"He resisted the opposition of the Council to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"He is the example you should follow."
"Help him to secure the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Help him to do this and you will have us on your side."
"However, with this non-committal pie-in-the-sky approach, we will not make any headway in Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not think that Mr Langen was listening very closely, because otherwise he would have heard a clear modernisation strategy and a social pact mentioned."
"I am not surprised that you did not hear the social pact mentioned, because it is an important part of this strategy."
"Mr Zapatero most definitely mentioned unemployment, including unemployment in his own country."
"Unemployment as a whole is something that worries us."
"However, he is not the one responsible for this; it is those who, in the last few years, have pursued a policy of maximum deregulation who are responsible."
"Those in your ranks who played their part in causing this bear the responsibility."
"This social pact is needed now in particular, because we know - and this is the point on which you are right, although only partly - that we must consolidate the budgets."
"However, we also know that this must not be at the expense of the vulnerable members of society, as there are currently many - you only need to read today's newspapers - who, for example, do not have unemployment insurance."
"It is not only a tragic fate for these individuals, it is also something that affects economic growth, because we know very well that people in the lower levels of society tend to cut their consumer cloth accordingly, and one of the reasons that economic development and economic growth is at risk is because there is not enough consumer spending."
"If we do not protect the vulnerable members of society by means of a social pact, it will not only be humanity that we will be failing, but we will also have failed to bring about economic development."
"Therefore, this social pact is very important."
"Mr Zapatero, with regard to the social pact in particular, you have our full support."
"(ES) Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, last September, the Commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, appeared in Parliament before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"After reporting on the recovery of German exports and the growth in French consumption, Mr Almunia said that the crisis would be much longer and deeper in Spain."
"In fact, the European Commission foresaw a continued increase in unemployment and a large deterioration in public finances for Spain in the next few years, and this year it is very probable that we will see a reduction in bank credit for families and businesses."
"I asked Commissioner Almunia in September why Europe was already recovering and why Spain would continue to fall into the mire and he replied literally 'because the Spanish Government is not carrying out the reforms that you and I agree on'."
"The crisis is global, but the solutions are local."
"Many European countries quickly acknowledged the crisis, acted quickly and are already recovering."
"You have wasted two years and are still not providing concrete solutions."
"Mr Zapatero, you have broken the fine tradition of the PSOE in Europe."
"Felipe González had the European social-democrat reformists as a reference point, but you are much nearer to revolutionary South American populist policies."
"Reforms help nations to progress more than revolutions and Europe is a model of good practice in this regard."
"Come here with humility and learn, do not seek to lecture."
"Two specific questions: when will we be able to speak Catalan in this Chamber?"
"And, finally, when will the Spanish state revoke the international treaties which prohibit flights from twenty three countries into Barcelona airport?"
"(ES) Hello, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"A couple of years ago, you assured us that Spain had exceeded Italy's per capita production and that it would soon surpass that of France."
"However, at present, according to international rating agencies, Spain heads the European Union poverty index, with 20% unemployment and a deficit of EUR 78 billion."
"What has happened, Mr Zapatero?"
"Will your economic prescriptions for Europe be the same as those you have applied in Spain?"
"Furthermore, this deficit has not been used to build extensive communication infrastructures."
"When will we, the citizens of Europe, benefit from a rail freight axis uniting the north and south of the continent which passes along the Mediterranean coast?"
"It is a deficit that has not been used to propel change in the productive model, either."
"How can we Europeans have confidence in your will to implement the European Digital Agenda when you have just halved the budget for research."
"Finally, in contrast to your fellow European members represented here, Spain still refuses to recognise Kosovo."
"For how long will you continue to take advantage of the international community's patience, refusing to accept referenda on self-determination as the democratic expression of the will of the people?"
"(ES) It is quite significant, and also symbolic, that the Prime Minister of a country which now has the highest rate of unemployment in the European Union should be speaking about the importance of creating employment."
"For this reason, I would like to ask the Prime Minister of the Spanish Government what, specifically, are the most important measures to achieve the objective of reducing unemployment, not just in Spain, but also in Europe."
"The Spanish Government's programme is extremely ambitious."
"It wishes to adopt a new strategy of growth and employment."
"At the same time, it is forgetting the Community Lisbon Programme, which had forecast the transformation of Europe into the most competitive region in the world."
"How can one envisage a new strategy and prepare it within a month, without first analysing the reasons for the failure of the previous programme?"
"(PT) Mr President, this period should herald a sea change in European Union policies and priorities."
"Unemployment has reached alarming levels, with more than 24 million unemployed and an increase of over 5 million in the last year alone, a situation that has also exacerbated poverty, which now affects more than 80 million people."
"We need a social development and progress pact that aims at production, particularly in the fields of agriculture and industry, at employment with rights and social inclusion, instead of coming back to insist upon the Stability Pact, with its liberalisations and neoliberal diktats, as the President of the Council has done."
"As we have already seen, they were the ones who contributed to the rise in inequality, to the prioritisation of greater profits and gains for the main economic and financial players."
"At the same time, an average of more than 21% of young people cannot find a job in the European Union, one in five children lives in poverty and discrimination against women is on the rise once again."
"In view of all this, the challenge now is to make a break with these current policies ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the Eurobarometer indicators, Spain has the fourth highest percentage of people - 21% - who live on the poverty line, after Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria."
"Under these circumstances, and with the data that has been brought to light on several occasions, not least regarding unemployment, what kind of immigration policy does the Spanish Presidency propose?"
"The Spanish Presidency says it wishes to increase immigration."
"At present, all this appears to me to be clearly contradictory."
"From Madrid's point of view, why does Spain and why do European countries - Spain is not the only one to have this unemployment situation - need to import a new workforce?"
"Do we want new immigrants who have no homes or jobs?"
"Do we want to increase this already worrying number of people who are living on the poverty line?"
"I believe that we must focus, instead, on a fundamental objective in the field of immigration, that of integrating the immigrants that we already have in our country and stopping ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero."
"I confess that as a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, I had prepared myself for this debate as if it were a bullfight; however, you have spoken of equality and human rights in such a way that I can now recognise what unites us, not what divides us."
"You have been a cautious matador;"
"I will be a cautious bull and I will remain in my enclosure."
"However, please allow me to return to two extremely tiresome questions on the contribution that you can make to the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon's implementation."
"You have laid down in your country various policies based on the principle of subsidiarity, thus supporting the identity-related demands of many communities, from the Catalans to the Basques, from the Valencians to the Galicians, and not without controversy."
"How do you now intend to defend the principle of subsidiarity in the relationship between the Member States and the European Union, in other words, the Member States' request to have their own traditions, their own identities, their own values recognised, so that the founding principle of the European Union - 'United in diversity' - is affirmed?"
"My second question concerns the role of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs: after Lisbon, who among yourself, President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, is responsible for explaining to Baroness Ashton that perhaps after 12 days, it is time to get on an aeroplane and fly to Haiti?"
"That it is time that the European Union's foreign policy had not only a budget but also a face and a human capacity to support, just as the other leaders of international organisations have done?"
"Unless, of course, we are confusing Haiti with Tahiti."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is the first to take place under the new Lisbon Treaty."
"Here is the first challenge."
"We have the treaty, but we need its proper enhancement and even more than that."
"The European Social Pact and European economic governance might be part of this 'more', but all these parts require more European financial resources and harmonisation of Member State tax policies."
"Unfortunately, such endeavours have always been undermined by national governments."
"I hope that the Spanish Presidency will be able to bring them together more than in the past."
"The Spanish Presidency should cope with the two main contradictions of the European Union: the contradiction between pan-European needs and European national egoists, and the contradiction between the level of development in the western territories of the Union and that in the eastern territories, with their consequences in terms of political sensitivity."
"There is a political sensitivity which is different in the two parts."
"There is a sense of the need for more Europe, which is slightly different in the two parts following social and economic cleavages."
"I hope that the Spanish Presidency will be able to cope with this."
"These really are challenges which again require more common resources and better political coherence."
"I therefore think that we not only need to read the Treaty, which is very right and gives us possibilities for more coherence, but also to provide..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain is now taking on the Presidency of the European Union for the fourth time."
"You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations."
"We now have the Treaty of Lisbon, which means that the European Parliament is now your key contact partner."
"In your programme, you say that you want the EU to take root in the will of those who render it legitimate, namely European citizens."
"That is a very ambitious aim."
"The path to achieving it can only be found via the representatives of European citizens, in other words the parliaments."
"I am therefore very pleased to hear you say that cooperation between the national parliaments, the parliaments of the EU Member States, and the European Parliament is the cornerstone of such a path."
"You want to bring the parliaments closer together in order to bring citizens closer together."
"That is a good thing."
"You have a great responsibility in this regard, as you are the first Presidency following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Other Presidencies will use you as an example."
"You are therefore creating the blueprint, so to speak."
"I would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned."
"I wish you much success!"
"(NL) The Presidency wishes to accelerate accession negotiations, including with Iceland."
"My group does not oppose that country's accession per se, but the uncertainty about the repayment of the Icesave loans to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands is too great at present."
"Iceland and Icesave have been taking great risks for many years."
"The sky seemed to be the limit, and the consumption and granting of loans just kept on going."
"International bodies such as the International Monetary Fund warned against these risks but, no, this behaviour continued unhindered until the recession struck."
"Curious, then, that the government in Reykjavik is now shedding crocodile tears."
"The writing had been on the wall for a long time that things would go seriously wrong."
"Forewarned is forearmed."
"In short, Iceland can join the EU if it meets its international obligations, and it has been laid down clearly how and when the Icesave loans are to be repaid."
"That is the only way of building the confidence required for accession."
"(PT) Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, you know as well as I do that growth of production in Europe will be slow and lacklustre over the coming years."
"Given this, I fail to understand why you are insisting on the withdrawal of the Stability Pact in its original form, or with the shrinking of public investment and social spending."
"I would also like to ask you about what you omitted from your speech."
"Why was nothing said about tax havens?"
"Why was nothing said about the opposition to banking secrecy by certain Member States?"
"Why was nothing said about a real European initiative for the taxation of financial transactions?"
"In short, the question that I would like to put to you is this: why do your commitments always fall short of justice in the economy, a modicum of justice in economic matters?"
"(HU) Among the joint objectives, I would like to highlight overcoming the economic crisis and the creation of new jobs."
"We are all aware that there are signs of recovery appearing in some countries, but this is not reflected in the overall employment situation."
"What the citizens of the European Union really need is jobs."
"This is the only acceptable basis for renewing the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have to make sure that the new EU 2020 programme does not repeat the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy."
"For now, we cannot see the factors that will make it different and more credible than its predecessor."
"So far, we have heard only about slogan-like targets, and an extremely tight schedule for adopting it."
"If the European Parliament is involved in the process in a way that is commensurate with its significance, it is impossible to finish the process before the end of the second quarter."
"We need a mature and harmonised programme instead of a hastily mounted communication campaign."
"Let us consider the following. How to share responsibility between the Member States and the Union?"
"How to control the implementation of the strategy?"
"Whom do we want to benefit with the new strategy?"
"How will the Union represent the interests of all its regions, not only of certain industries, companies, or countries?"
"How to harmonise the cohesion and the structural policies?"
"When working under pressure there will be no time to answer all these questions."
"Haste comes at the expense of quality."
"I draw your attention to two European-level issues included in the targets of the future Hungarian Presidency."
"The first one is to establish a common water management strategy, as water is our common treasure."
"The concept of the Danube as a green corridor is related to this."
"Our other aim is to lend a hand to the European regions."
"We have to take advantage of the strength of these communities."
"(SV) Thank you for a strong social agenda - you have our full support on that."
"I have two questions."
"The first concerns the Copenhagen Summit."
"It was a failure and the question now is how can we regain the initiative as regards the fight against climate change?"
"Can Spain pave the way for a binding climate agreement in Mexico in which we do not increase the gap between the poor countries of the world and the richer countries of the world?"
"Is it possible, for example, to attempt to secure financing of climate initiatives that does not take funds from regular EU aid for fighting poverty?"
"That would be an important matter for the Spanish Presidency to address."
"As far as the social pact is concerned, it sounds very interesting."
"However, there is a serious problem: there is no longer a reasonable balance between Europe's employees and Europe's employers."
"We have a Posting of Workers Directive that has upset that balance and which puts such a social pact at risk."
"There is too much wage dumping and too much crude exploitation."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his very sincere and European speech at the opening of Spain's Presidency."
"This is normally a moment to be polite, and my colleagues know I am always very polite, but I have to return to the issue of the many British citizens and other European citizens who are having problems with losing their homes in Spain."
"I approach it not like the former speaker from an anti-European perspective."
"I approach it from a pro-European perspective, where this Parliament has, time and time again, done reports and had hearings through our Petitions Committee."
"It is a European problem."
"It is a problem of free movement."
"It is a problem of European citizenship."
"It is a problem of European justice, access to civil justice."
"I am sorry, Prime Minister."
"You made many wonderful comments about European citizenship and fairness and honesty."
"I do hope, Prime Minister, that you will be able to translate those comments to those European citizens who face homelessness and the loss of their savings in your country because, I am sorry to say, of what appears to this Parliament to have been administrative abuse."
"(CS) Mr Prime Minister, in the programme of priorities for your Presidency, you also mentioned, in the chapter on transport, the Galileo project."
"The Galileo project ranks among the European Union's biggest and most complex projects."
"During the Spanish Presidency, this project should already be scheduled into its implementation phase."
"I would like to ask you to devote more attention to this project, which is complex not only in technical but also in economic terms, since its funding has not been completely clarified."
"I believe that thanks to the Spanish Presidency, this programme will be successfully fulfilled and the entire project launched."
"This is a huge task for the Spanish Presidency, since it is to be followed by other highly significant projects in the sphere of innovation, telecommunications and other related matters."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Barroso, Commissioner Almunia, I, too, wish to focus on the EU 2020 strategy, as the need for Europe to work for its citizens and their jobs is greater than ever in these times of crisis."
"You have announced that EU 2020 is an important priority area, but at the inauguration of your Presidency in Madrid, you made some controversial political statements and received a great deal of criticism, even though it is actually an important responsibility to get Member States singing from the same song sheet, and one that requires diplomacy."
"Are you, the Spanish Presidency, perhaps hampering President Van Rompuy with these statements?"
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, as colegislator and important partner for the European Parliament, should you perhaps now be working towards the legislative programme?"
"Is it not in fact your job - and this is also in your programme - to ensure decisive financial market regulation?"
"After all, in that regard, Parliament was disappointed in the compromise on financial supervision reached by the Council last December."
"Should you perhaps be focusing your energy much more on this, and also on the internal market, where there is much room for improvement?"
"This is important for our small and medium-sized enterprises, our driving force for jobs."
"Where EU 2020 is concerned, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) also wants to see an end to the free-for-all for Member States, of course, and instead specific proposals - here I am also looking at President Barroso - for a solid, transparent governance structure, one that also respects subsidiarity."
"Brussels' remit does not cover the retirement age, for example."
"Should Brussels be taking decisions on reforms of labour markets or education systems in Member States?"
"Let us be decisive, but let us also respect subsidiarity."
"(SK) The programme you have presented is very ambitious - it may allow the European Union to make quite a lot of progress and, since I have had the opportunity to meet several members of your government, I know that they are professionally very capable and well-prepared to implement this programme - my congratulations."
"I am particularly looking forward to cooperating with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Interior, because this is the area I focus on as the Vice-Chair of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"We have before us a large amount of work and an array of measures, including those mentioned at our session yesterday evening, mainly relating to the fields of justice and internal affairs, which the Spanish Presidency has decided to deal with courageously."
"There are many questions and many solutions are needed in the area of fundamental rights of European Union citizens, including material and procedural rights of participants in civil and criminal proceedings and the issue of protection with respect to the reintroduction of the social dimension of European policy."
"We have to pay attention to issues relating to immigration and asylum, and I believe we will ..."
"Mr President, one of the changes the Prime Minister spoke of this morning is the Citizens' Initiative."
"Indeed, I think it is fitting that one of the countries whose citizens voted 'yes' to the constitution is the country that will start the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Indeed, many times when I was canvassing for a 'yes' vote in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty, I quoted Spain and the Spanish people."
"But we as politicians have a responsibility to ensure that, while citizens are aware of the real potential of the Citizens' Initiative, they are also aware of its limitations."
"We know that it is not just a question of one million signatures on any issue."
"The issue must come within the competence of the Union and we must not promise more than we can deliver."
"Secondly, this morning, you mentioned food security, Prime Minister."
"I am pleased to see that in the Agriculture Council, you are making progress with the issue of improving the functioning of the food supply chain."
"Food security cannot - and will not - be guaranteed unless our farmers can earn a fair and reasonably stable income."
"Finally, Prime Minister, well done on your initiative to stamp out gender violence;"
"I look forward to hearing the details."
"(RO) Let me begin by expressing the hope that, in spite of the fairly general nature of the programme, the Spanish Presidency will achieve concrete results by the end of June."
"I welcome the fact that the Presidency is concerned with developing the European Research Area and ensuring mobility for researchers."
"However, at a time when there are labour market restrictions, this task is going to be difficult to achieve."
"I hope that the informal meeting of employment ministers at the end of this month will end with specific results in this area."
"The programme also includes the review of the TEN-T action guidelines."
"It would be desirable for the review also to take into account the Danube Strategy which, although not mentioned directly in the Presidency's programme, is a European Commission commitment for 2010."
"In the energy sector, it would be desirable to improve the European Action Plan for Energy Efficiency and adopt the 2010-2014 Action Plan for Energy."
"With regard to the former, I believe that its revision should also include a proposal on financial resources, especially with a view to making buildings energy efficient."
"The European Economic Recovery Plan has included the European Union's involvement in funding the Nabucco gas pipeline."
"It is in the European Union's interest for this funding to continue in the 2010-2014 Action Plan for Energy as well."
"As far as the Eastern Partnership is concerned, it is worth stating that the European Union's relations with Ukraine are extremely important."
"I would also take this opportunity to ask you not to forget the Southern Caucasus region, which is an important alternative energy resource for the European Union, or the Republic of Moldova, which is in great need of EU assistance during this period of transition to democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Zapatero, thank you for the great commitment you are making during this parliamentary term regarding the items you have announced, even though this is no longer the time to list all the useful items, but to make practical efforts to revive Europe."
"We need to end this period of defining institutional structures and to face the major issues which still prevent Europe from being able to compete on an equal footing with its international partners."
"We need to know whether the European Union will be able, one day very soon, to have a seat in the United Nations, whether it will be able to have a seat, as the European Union, at the G20, whether it wants greater fiscal and social harmonisation, and what resources it wants to put into the European economic circuit so that it can truly do what its other international competitors have done."
"We need to come here - and I say this also to President Barroso - with concrete measures to revive Europe, because, in six months' time, we will not see the same results as we have seen previously with other previous experiences."
"We would also like to know whether the time has finally come when, as Kissinger would say 30 years ago, the major world leaders know which telephone number to call when they need to speak to someone in Europe, and do not just contact the Member States."
"At stake is Europe's dignity as it emerges from the Treaty of Lisbon, but also the European social model, that fundamental democracy which we Members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament strongly demand and on which we want the future well-being of our citizens to be based."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, Mr Barroso, I would like to make it clear that there are certain ambiguities in the speech that we have heard here, particularly with regard to economic matters."
"The aims and stated aims are sound, but certain ambiguities remain."
"Specifically, there are no concrete measure to combat unemployment."
"However, despite this reservation, I would like to focus my speech on institutional matters."
"The Spanish Presidency talks a lot about the issue of the Citizens' Initiative, and about the swift and rapid installation of the system for the External Action Service."
"At present, on an institutional level, I think that some statement about the relationship with the remaining institutions would also be important, since we are in the initial stages of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I also believe that it is important that the Council and the Spanish Presidency clearly demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with the Commission and Parliament, so as to clarify how relations between the Commission and Parliament will play out in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, as the Spanish Presidency now has a unique opportunity to set precedents."
"Whatever the Spanish Presidency does in terms of the aforementioned relations with the Commission, on the one hand, and with Parliament, on the other, and with the President of the European Council himself, clearly attests to what will come to be seen as the success of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In view of this, I would like to be given clearer information about how you view the structure of relations between the rotating Presidency, the Commission, Parliament and the Presidency of the Council."
"(ES) Dear Prime Minister Zapatero, welcome, good luck and thank you for your speech."
"Thank you, above all, for that reference to the European Social Charter."
"Finally, somebody in the Council understands that Europe cannot be formed without workers, and much less so against workers."
"Finally, somebody in the Council is beginning to understand that we have a very serious problem, with millions of disillusioned people, with trade organisations which feel they are being kept out of the process of European integration, which only looks at the business aspect, has lost its political ambitions and has little social ambition."
"Two actions have poisoned this relationship with the Parliament and with the trade union movement."
"One is the movement of workers throughout Europe, which creates a threat to national social models, and the other is the Working Time Directive, which threatens historical achievements and the conciliation of professional and working life."
"Prime Minister, you have spoken of six months of change."
"Change the procedures, change the course."
"You will not be able to change everything, but set off on a new route, a route which Europe needs, because Europe needs workers and it will not be possible to construct just an economic Europe; it needs to be a political and social Europe, too."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been told that there is a delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea in the gallery to whom we extend a warm welcome."
"We wish to welcome them and the leader of the delegation, Lee Kang Rae, on the occasion of the twelfth inter-parliamentary meeting between our Parliament and their country's Parliament."
"The European Parliament has always supported peace and stability and the defence of human rights in the Korean Peninsula."
"Naturally, we welcome the increasingly active role of the Republic of Korea on the international stage and we also wish them all the best when they chair the G20 this year."
"We are aware of the broad association agreement between the Republic of Korea and the European Union which will shortly enter the ratification process."
"We congratulate our Korean colleagues, therefore."
"We hope that their attendance is successful and, above all, that they enjoy the privilege of following a debate as fundamental as the one currently taking place in our Chamber."
"Presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency (continuation of debate)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us continue with the debate on the presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for this Parliament, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency attaches importance to the fulfilment of the structural reforms provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, with regard to the European External Action Service, to the Citizens' Initiative, and to the European Union's adherence to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, for which my committee has already appointed a rapporteur, the Spaniard, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, whom you already know."
"However, in an interview published in the Spanish newspaper, El País, last Sunday, you expressed the wish, Mr Zapatero, that the law on religious freedom might result in Spain taking steps towards normalisation within all its public institutions."
"Thus, I would like, in this respect, to suggest that we reflect very briefly on the fact that Europe's structures are a means of achieving an objective, and the European Union's objective is confirmed in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon: the promotion of dignity, equality, freedom and solidarity."
"I must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading."
"Cultural unity comes before economic unity."
"Europe's spirit is stronger than the public - excuse me, judicial - structure."
"Europe's spirit is rooted in the instinct for truth and beauty belonging to ancient Greece, in the cult of justice belonging to Rome, and on the basis of this extraordinarily great heritage it is Christianity that has added the value of human beings, always as equals from conception to natural death."
"Today, it is in the name of the Cross of Christ that we ask to go to Haiti, to be present in Haiti, because all human beings, and the poorest in particular, are at the heart of this."
"And so I ask you: what does 'normalisation' mean with regard to religious freedom?"
"Does it mean perhaps preventing all citizens from publicly expressing their religion?"
"Does it mean forgetting the roots, including the Christian roots, of our countries?"
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Zapatero, Mr Buzek, ladies and gentlemen, in this period of crisis, trade policy occupies an ever more important place in public debate, as Europeans are increasingly finding that the trade strategy introduced at Union level has a direct impact on growth and employment."
"Against a background of increased international competition, the race for reduced costs has led to too many job losses or relocations."
"In the face of this situation, our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation, the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development."
"During his hearing, the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, appeared to agree that trade could not be an end in itself."
"I should therefore like to know if, in the course of your Presidency, you will support a reform of European trade policy to ensure that it creates more jobs and is linked more closely to a true industrial policy."
"Will you also take action to support fair trade at world level, fair trade that is capable of promoting development, decent work and respect for human rights?"
"In other words, will you introduce binding social and environmental standards into our agreements?"
"(ES) Mr Zapatero, for a Spaniard, such as I am, it is an honour to greet you here, as you take your turn as the President of the European Union."
"This is a period of many expectations and challenges and, of course, we must not fail to live up to those expectations."
"It is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems."
"You know that we agree with the programme you have put forward."
"You know that, for the Spanish Partido Popular, this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of Europe and that is important to Spain."
"It is an ambitious programme and, hopefully, a programme full of content."
"I hope that in this album of the Spanish Presidency - since it will surely be colourful and varied - people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them."
"The crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the Apocalypse."
"You have had the honesty to recognise that there is 20% unemployment in Spain, but that does not curtail you."
"I believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together."
"It is a real problem."
"The time available does not allow me to say too much, Prime Minister."
"However, I do want to tell you that Spain faces many challenges ahead, that I am certain of Spain's capability as a nation and that I want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge."
"At this time in Europe, we must not fail to live up to these expectations"
"On the other hand, the globalised world - and you have referred to it with intelligence - means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests."
"Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming irrelevant."
"Finally, Prime Minister, we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals."
"We have that right."
"We must also have the humility to accept the advice that Don Quixote gave to Sancho Panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the Isle of Barataria."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister's very positive and ambitious programme for the Spanish Presidency."
"His emphasis on jobs and growth is vital to us all as we come out of the financial downturn, and I very much look forward to working with a fellow socialist government."
"The next six months are crucial for the EU's economic and environmental future, and we look forward to the February Council for ambitious leadership in reforming the financial sector."
"In the wake of the failed climate change negotiations at Copenhagen, I am keen to hear how the Presidency will work with the Commission to put forward a common EU target for emissions reductions for the 31 January target."
"It has already been mentioned, but I urge, finally, that, during your Presidency, Prime Minister, you will take the opportunity to resolve the issue of land grab and other issues which cause such distress and heartache to tens of thousands of law-abiding property owners across southern Spain."
"We really do need action now."
"Mr Zapatero, it is good to see you here, and I wish you a very successful term in office."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency will be judged on the basis of its institutional implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Prime Minister, I wish you every success."
"To stimulate economic recovery and the creation of new jobs, your challenge is to bring about the completion of the EU's internal market, including opening up services markets in areas that are still treated as exceptions."
"Until this has been achieved, the success of any EU strategy will have a limited effect."
"I support your commitment to the creation of a common energy market, interconnecting energy grids all around Europe."
"I wish you would use to this end Parliament's position on external energy security and solidarity that was adopted back in 2007 and is awaiting implementation."
"Agenda 2020 means introducing information and communication technologies into everyday practice, making use of the best practices of Member States that have already made progress in this field."
"I hope that your Presidency can decide about starting a central agency for administration of IT systems that Europe clearly needs."
"What we also urgently need is to work out a reliable European cyber defence security strategy."
"I hope that the EU will play a more active role in stabilising the situation in the South Caucasus, too, within the framework of the new Eastern Partnership strategy."
"Last but not least, I suggest that you remain committed to the EU's common position on Cuba until real changes there can be confirmed."
"Sadly, the refusal of the regime to allow our socialist colleague to enter Cuba because he wanted to contact the opposition is not a sign of real change."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Zapatero, thank you first of all, Mr Zapatero, for reintroducing ambition, political perspective and also energy, at a time when the European Union has to bounce back from the crisis and in the wake of the failure in Copenhagen."
"I expect the Commission and the Presidency to enable us to put the creation of more and higher quality jobs, the fight against social exclusion, and sustainable development at the heart of the 2020 strategy."
"This is true in particular for the agriculture budget, and also for the fisheries budget."
"You have committed yourself to this."
"Mr Zapatero, we are counting on you to provide the resources for this policy, to associate the decontamination of soil with food security, to create the conditions for green jobs and for the preservation of fisheries resources, to ensure food security and to create fairer trading conditions for the countries of the South."
"We need an ambitious agriculture budget, and I would also ask you to link the fisheries budget with this budget."
"On these points, our jobs, but also our policy, will be judged on the basis of the results achieved."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Zapatero, among the matters which were presented today by the Prime Minister in a somewhat general and broad fashion, there are many matters which require elaboration and the presentation of specific proposals."
"These matters will fall into two categories - those which, objectively speaking, the Spanish Presidency will have to deal with, and those it will want to deal with because it will be trying to achieve its objectives."
"Among those which must be acted upon are questions of the relations between European institutions, and here, I would like to draw Mr Zapatero's attention to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon which, in the protocol on subsidiarity, talk about the necessity of defining the roles of regional and local authorities within Member States, too."
"Spain's experience, if we are talking about regionalisation, suggests that perhaps it is the Spanish Presidency which will try to clarify the wording on the roles of regional and local authorities."
"This is particularly significant when Mr Zapatero talks about how one of his objectives is the matter of developing innovativeness and education, which, as we know, is, in large measure, achieved with European funds at regional and local level."
"The European Parliament awaits with great interest the elaboration of certain matters, the resolution of institutional matters and proposals concerning the future of the cohesion policy, which, as we know, will be forthcoming first in Saragossa, and then at the Week of Innovative Regions in Europe."
"We are waiting with great interest for decisions and specific proposals."
"(EL) Mr President, Prime Minister, the fact that Spain is taking over the Presidency of the European Union at this difficult juncture is a huge challenge and a huge opportunity for those of us who maintain that the European recipe to date for dealing with the crisis has been unilateral and has not done enough to limit the impact on the real economy and employment, for those of us who maintain that the recovery strategy should also have been a strategy to change the development model, thereby safeguarding the economic, social and environmental welfare of the citizens of Europe."
"The Spanish Presidency is a huge challenge for those of us who believe that European economic governance is needed, alongside democratisation of the economic policy instruments that will safeguard financial prudence and the required solidarity, where deemed necessary, in order to protect the interests of European citizens."
"(ES) I am pleased to have the opportunity to say that José Luis Zapatero has not failed to surprise European women with highly innovative and progressive measures."
"He has, of course, done so by forming a truly equal government and through the brave manner in which he has brought the matters of gender equality and mutual respect to the national and European agendas."
"Prime Minister, I warmly congratulate you on your ambitious programme of action against gender violence, which is a social scourge."
"The creation of a European watchdog on gender violence is an avant-garde proposal which the women of Europe support and applaud."
"Prime Minister, on behalf of the Portuguese socialists, I wish you luck."
"You can count on our solidarity. Women for Zapatero!"
"(ES) I would like to tell you most sincerely, Prime Minister, that you have given a magnificent presentation of what form the Spanish Presidency will take."
"I think it was an exceptional speech."
"I wanted to ask you about Latin America, Prime Minister."
"I think it is very important for Europe and, of course, Europe is also important to Latin America."
"There are many human links, many business interests and many emerging nations in Latin America, such as Argentina, Brazil or Mexico, which form part of that new world governance, and which must form an alliance with Europe."
"I wish to ask you, Mr President, what are the plans of the European Union and your Presidency with regard to Latin America, what is expected from the summit with Latin America and what plans does the European Union and your Presidency have with Latin America?"
"(ES) As I only have a minute to speak, I will concentrate on citizens' rights."
"The Spanish Presidency is an opportunity for us to put our house in order."
"One example is the Canary Islands and the people who live there."
"Last year, I was there to take a course in Spanish."
"To my surprise, I discovered that, if I take a Spanish course at a school on the mainland or in the Balearic Islands, costs are reimbursed, but not if the school is in the Canary Islands, as it is not part of Europe."
"It is part of the European Union, but not part of Europe, with the consequence that language schools in these islands, even where the quality of the courses is excellent, are deprived of the opportunity..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the Prime Minister spoke in his opening remarks about the need for Europe to develop a more effective foreign policy, especially with regard to its near neighbours, amongst which we must include Israel."
"Here we have a country which is in military occupation of another people's territory, which infringes human rights, which maintains the blockade of Gaza and applies collective punishment to one and a half million people, and yet we regard it as a normal trading partner."
"Our principles and our policies are clear: they were restated by foreign ministers just last month, but our words do not seem to be backed up by any deeds."
"I think the true test of this Presidency over the next few months will be whether we start to apply some independence in our relations with Israel, and whether we start to demonstrate that our principles mean something and that we will apply them."
"(HU) I also wish the Spanish Presidency, which is the first Trio Presidency in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, a lot of success."
"Regarding the 2020 strategy, it has been repeatedly mentioned that it would play a key role in recovering from the crisis."
"However, those Member States who are competent for the policies in this area have a major responsibility."
"Please let me draw your attention to the fact that we have Community policies and Community budgets which can work as a tool in reducing the effects of the crisis."
"From this point of view, it is extremely important that the negotiations on the new budget period should start at the beginning of 2011, and that the Commission should submit its budget proposal at that time, allowing us to elaborate these policies."
"I would like to ask the Commission to do so in time."
"(ES) Prime Minister, I hope that you, as the Prime Minister of the Spanish Government, really have the courage and the ability to put into practice and implement your very ambitious programme, especially the programme on violence against women."
"I have two questions."
"One relates to foreign policy."
"You have said that Europe must bet on foreign policy but also on the defence of European interests."
"I wish to ask you, what are European interests?"
"Are they the interests of large, transnational companies which want to make profits without regard to social or environmental agreements?"
"Or are they the interests that are enshrined in European values, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, such as human rights, democratisation, strengthening of civil society and the rights of minorities?"
"To what interests do you refer?"
"Another question."
"You have not said a single word about the subject of migration, which is so important in Europe."
"We need a programme..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, you started off today, Prime Minister, with a very pro-European agenda."
"What I would like to tell you is that this agenda is not working."
"The euro at this moment in time is in dire straits in certain countries."
"Greece is on its backside; Spain, your country, is in dire straits as well."
"You have got a country of your own making with unemployment for 18- to 24-year olds currently running at 40%."
"The Spanish people can speak for themselves."
"In your role now for the next six months, you are also speaking on behalf of people from my country."
"Initially you mentioned further integration."
"I ask you, before you bring more integration in, that you go back to the people of my country, the United Kingdom, and give them the choice of a referendum."
"(HU) Mr President, you have mentioned the importance of change, invoking as justification the global economic crisis, which has been the gravest one in the last 80 years, causing the loss of 8 million jobs."
"The tools listed are worth supporting, but do not mean a real turn for the better."
"After drawing a lesson from the crisis, we need real economic revolution."
"Do you agree that the liberalised market is unable to self-regulate?"
"Do you agree that the liberal dogmas should be reviewed?"
"Do you agree that it is necessary to increase the regulatory role of the Community, and that government interference is indispensable in a market economy?"
"Your response would be most welcome."
"Mr President, I note with satisfaction that the European Parliament has more strength and vitality behind it than ever."
"There have been a very high number of interventions, specific questions, which would be impossible to deal with completely in my response, without prolonging this session entirely unacceptably."
"Allow me to make a compromise and to refer in my intervention to certain questions which I think are most relevant and must be clarified."
"My compromise is that each and every one of the specific questions which have been raised by members will get a response at the final sitting that I attend at the end of the six-month period, when Spain's rotating Presidency will be assessed and judged."
"I therefore hope to satisfy all Members on certain specific matters, which I have taken note of."
"Allow me to say a few words about the interventions of my compatriots, the Spanish MEPs."
"I wish to thank the Spanish Partido Popular for the support it has shown at this sitting, which was confirmed in the national political debate and endorsed through a motion."
"This is undoubtedly an extraordinarily positive factor for the job in hand, and highlights our shared European desire, the combined effort and the work that we are prepared to continue to do focused on the very difficult times we are living through as we confront the economic crisis."
"I wish to refer to immigration."
"One of the honourable Members highlighted the question of what our immigration policy is and even said that no reference had been made to it."
"It is true that there was no reference to it in my speech but, in short, one has to prioritise."
"It has been expressly stated that I am in favour of mass immigration and that is categorically not true."
"What I am in favour of is respecting the human rights of all, of every single person, wherever they may come from."
"(Applause)"
"We have a European pact on immigration, promoted and endorsed during the French Presidency."
"We must abide by that pact and, of course, that pact includes border controls, cooperation and political dialogue with the countries the immigrants come from, as the best way of avoiding a massive flow of immigrants."
"However, I must add that integration forms part of the policy of the European immigration pact, integration in respect of the human rights of immigrants."
"I speak on behalf of a country which has, in the last few years, experienced very intense levels of immigration, but not in vain, as, since the year 2000, the Spanish population has increased by six million people."
"It has also had experience of emigration since, at the time of the dictatorship, there was economic emigration to many European countries."
"We well know, through experience, what it is to have to leave your own country in search of a future or some shred of economic dignity."
"We know that it is difficult to swallow and we know that countries and nations are not measured purely by their political, military or economic power."
"Nations, along with Europe, are also measured by their treatment of and respect for human rights and for the people who come to work in our lands in search of a future which they cannot have in their own."
"(Applause)"
"Furthermore, the European Union must be aware - as indeed it is - that by 2025, 30% of its population will be over 65 years of age."
"This will not occur in any other area or region of the world."
"We will be the area, the continent with the greatest number of people over 65, and this will result in a decline in our capacity to produce, a decline in the active population and in labour capacity, and this will put pressure on our social protection systems."
"In the medium term, Europe needs workers."
"Beyond the crisis, it will need workers, it needs to get women into the jobs market and it needs that increase in the active population in order to maintain social protection."
"This is a fundamental conclusion."
"Secondly, subsidiarity and languages."
"Of course, we will be faithful in our application of the Lisbon Treaty, and I would like to point out that it was my government that promoted the use of Spanish co-official languages in the European institutions."
"There is no doubt, however, that at the moment, balance between the institutions is highlighted in the application of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"There has been some comment, which I believe to be unfair, although I must admit that it has been very isolated in nature."
"As the President of the rotating Presidency, I have expressed, declared and supported the institutional role of the permanent President of the Council, of course, the High Representative, and the full collaboration of the Commission, and I will continue to do so."
"The new powers of the European Parliament will be set in motion by the rotating Spanish Presidency, in full collaboration with the President of the Commission, who has always demonstrated his continuous working relationship with Parliament."
"I refer to the work carried out by Mr Durão Barroso."
"I have been criticised for giving him my support."
"Yes, I have supported him and I do support him, because I have seen him work in favour of a strong and united Europe, and that is very important, over and above ideological positioning."
"Thirdly, the financial system, tax havens and new regulation and supervision."
"I did not refer to this so as not to exhaust all subjects, but I fully agree with the application of the rules on new financial supervision and regulation."
"As for the requirement to put an end to tax havens, the rotating Presidency will be firm and strict."
"(Applause)"
"It will, of course, promote, encourage and demand all countries to push forward with the necessary agreements for fiscal transparency and for the provision of information in the context of the international community."
"On the subject of climate change, on 11 February the Council will carry out an analysis of the Copenhagen Summit, with the help of the Commission."
"Of course, the European Union should continue to take steps in favour of a strategy which will bring us to a progressive agreement to promote the reduction of climate change."
"I am in favour of the European Union knowing how to intelligently align its own ambition, which it has laid down for 2020 or for the period 2020-2030, with the demands of other players with regard to reducing their emissions."
"In support of European unity and a common strategy, we must entrust this task to the European Commission."
"I also fully agree that the United States and China are the two lead players for whom we can see a much more active role."
"Of course, I am fully convinced that the common agriculture policy should include fisheries and that the social pact which was referred to by some Members needs revision, a change to incorporate the interests, legitimate representation and the constructive position of a large proportion of those who represent workers in Europe."
"They represent the workers, the unions that are the expression of the European social pact which, in the last few decades, has made us the region with the greatest social welfare and the greatest prosperity since the Second World War."
"(Applause)"
"The future of the European Union and European prosperity cannot be written down without the workers, without social rights and without social welfare policies and therefore, we must actively incorporate them."
"There was a question concerning the area of foreign policy."
"The Middle East, Latin America in particular, and an allusion to Israel."
"We hope in the next six months to push forward an agreement on the Middle East."
"We know that peace in the Middle East is a necessary, fundamental condition for peace in other regions, where terror and conflict have spread, driven by radicalism and ideological and religious fanaticism."
"The European Union will fulfil its role by contributing to that peace process through a commitment to take up talks again."
"We know what the aims and the conditions are."
"We know that that dialogue must include the recognition of the Palestinian State as one of its fundamental conditions."
"(Applause)"
"To work with Israel is to work for peace."
"If we do not work with Israel, in spite of the criticisms that it deserves for many of its actions, we will not be able to see peace on the horizon."
"To work with Palestine is to work for its right to a state, a territory, to be able to see prosperity on the horizon and to deal with all the outstanding issues."
"We will do this in a determined manner and, of course, with the collaboration of other major international players."
"Regarding Latin America."
"Latin America is a young, immensely vital continent, with a great future."
"It has a population of 500 million people and has a great European imprint, not just a great Spanish imprint, but a great European imprint because, over there, democratic values and progressive values now exist, after a long time, and some difficulties consolidating what its stability and its consolidation as a group of nations mean."
"At the Latin American Summit, we wish to achieve or make progress towards trade agreements with Mercosur, with Central America and with the Andean Community."
"This is all in the interests of development and progress, for Latin America as much as for European economic interests, which, in my opinion should also be defended."
"European interests."
"When reference was made, and agreed on by other Members, to Union policies on equality between men and women, I considered this to be a very good example and a policy of citizenship."
"Those are European interests."
"The European interests I uphold in foreign policy action are the interests involving the values of what Europe represents, which has its origins in the Enlightenment and in all the cultural, religious and civic traditions that have flourished and developed in Europe."
"To standardise is to tolerate, to standardise is to respect European tradition, the best of European tradition, which means that this land is the land of religious, ideological, political and cultural freedom."
"That freedom demands tolerance and equality of treatment between all faiths and beliefs, so that democracy can be complete democracy."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I basically wanted to refer to some isolated interventions, about my country, about Spain, from other countries, and particularly Mr Langen's reference, a particular reference to Spain, about our economic characteristics, which I feel obliged to answer."
"I must say that when I began my speech this morning, I spoke as a European country, as a pro-European country, thankful to be in the European Union, thankful to those countries who encouraged our entry into the European Union, and having experienced a great transformation and great progress in these past 25 years."
"So much so, that since we entered the European Union, we have reduced the difference in per capita income by 15 points, exceeding the current European average."
"This has been thanks to the efforts of many Spaniards, of its workers and its enterprises."
"Currently, after making such significant progress, we are experiencing the economic crisis, which is affecting employment."
"It is true that we have a high level of unemployment, as happened during the crises of the 70s and 90s."
"This has been a characteristic of our country, just as when there is growth, we create more employment than other countries."
"However, I can assure Mr Langen, if the rate of unemployment should increase in his country tomorrow, whoever may be governing it, my response as a political leader, as Prime Minister and as a pro-European, would be one of support and solidarity, and not one of recrimination, which was your response in this House this morning."
"(Applause)"
"It would be a response of support and solidarity."
"That is my way of feeling and being European, with the admiration I hold for your country, and I hope this does not happen."
"In short, Mr President, we will work during this Presidency towards a European project of solidarity, of cooperation, of more economic union, of reforms and of convictions."
"I thank you for your references to Mr Almunia, amongst other reasons, because he was proposed by me for the responsibilities he undertakes."
"We also know that in the next six months, Parliament can count on the collaboration, respect and appreciation of my country and my government and that, at the end of this Presidency, I will be here, I will be held to account exhaustively and I will answer any questions that may come up with respect and solidarity."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Zapatero, for your speech."
"Our cooperation, cooperation between the European Parliament and the Spanish Presidency, is very important."
"We work in the area of making law, which is why the governments of successive presidencies are essential for us to be able to carry out the legislative process."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I enjoyed the speech by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Spain, especially the balance between economics, social issues and the environment."
"I support the idea of a social pact based on the social partners because, besides it being a condition for the achievement of a major social ambition, I am convinced that it is a factor in Europe's economic performance."
"At a time when the Iberian peninsula holds two important presidencies (the Council of the European Union via the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and the European Commission via Portugal's José Manuel Barroso), I regret that the Spanish Presidency has not demonstrated its capacity to bring added political value to relations with the continent of America outside the United States and Canada."
"It is regrettable because the sixth European Union-Latin America/Caribbean (EU-LAC) Summit is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2010, whilst the EU-Mexico and EU-Brazil Summits are to be held in the first and second halves of 2010, respectively."
"I would like to take advantage of this speech to express my regret, once again, that the new President of the European Council, who was elected in mid-November and took office on 1 December 2009, has still not been to greet the Members of the European Parliament or even sent them a simple message."
"I would like to point out that I was a member of the AFET delegation which prepared the priorities for the Spanish Presidency in Madrid, in October 2009."
"Based on my knowledge of these objectives, I have noted points in common with those of Romania."
"The Spanish Presidency's main interest is the Mediterranean area, which can bring major benefits to Romania as well."
"Romanian companies will have the opportunity to return to markets in the Mediterranean area (in countries such as Algeria, Turkey, Syria and Egypt)."
"The major common objective is to ensure the European Union's energy security, with Romania entering on the agenda in this area: Nabucco, the Constanţa-Trieste pan-European oil pipeline and the interconnection of gas networks in neighbouring states: Romania-Hungary (Arad-Szeged), Romania-Bulgaria (Giurgiu-Ruse) Isaccea and Negru Vodă."
"At the same time, I feel that the Spanish Presidency must focus particular attention on the Eastern Partnership countries."
"Romania has a major political objective, which is that the Republic of Moldova should be included, from the point of view of its prospective accession, in the group of Western Balkan countries."
"The negotiations on signing the Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova started in Chişinău on 12 January 2008."
"Moldova is in need of financial and political support at the moment."
"This should be a priority for both the current Presidency and subsequent presidencies."
"Mr President, for the next six months, you will hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union."
"Many challenges await you in the field of foreign policy, especially as regards the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"What do you intend to do to relaunch the Union for the Mediterranean, the headquarters of which are located in Barcelona?"
"The Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean has recently been appointed."
"How do you envisage your collaboration with the Union for the Mediterranean's first ever Secretary General?"
"We need an ambitious policy for the Mediterranean that goes beyond economic partnerships to make way for real political partnerships."
"Spain is picking up the baton of the Presidency of the European Union, just as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force."
"This means that the presiding state will be able to cooperate more closely with the European Parliament in implementing its ambitious programme."
"I support the most important priorities provided for in Spain's agenda on the EU 2020 strategy, the safeguarding of employment and social progress, on initiatives in the areas of education and innovation and matters of energy security."
"As a Lithuanian MEP, to me it is very important that the presiding country should also further continue the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, adopted during the Swedish Presidency."
"These years are the years of Europe's struggle with poverty and social isolation."
"I would like to ask Spain to take the necessary measures during its Presidency for the struggle with poverty and the safeguarding of minimum social guarantees."
"Sweden, a country in the north of the EU, had a successful Presidency, and I wish the southern state of Spain useful work for the good of EU citizens."
"I would like to draw the Spanish Presidency's attention to a number of matters which I regard as priorities and for which I believe that we need to find solutions in the coming months."
"Patients' rights in cross-border health care must be treated as a priority as all patients in Europe must enjoy equality of rights."
"I call on the Presidency to make efforts to unblock the situation at Council level on this dossier."
"I also ask the Presidency to give its support to the directive regarding informing the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescriptions, which the Council is opposed to."
"Maintaining the status quo in this area is of no benefit to patients or the pharmaceutical industry."
"The business sector requires support so that we can emerge from the economic crisis, particularly in new Member States which have severe problems in this area."
"In this respect, I believe that support for SMEs is absolutely imperative."
"The Spanish Presidency must show strong support for the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions, which is vital to SMEs."
"I wish the Spanish Presidency every success in achieving its priorities and in finding solutions to the challenges which the European Union is currently facing."
"in writing. - Europe's objective is a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East with a two-state solution at its heart."
"We want a secure state for Israelis and a viable democratic state for Palestinians, based on the pre-1967 borders."
"But we are at one minute to midnight for such a solution."
"The clear Council statement of December 8 needs to be driven forward with vigour and determination by you."
"Creating conditions for early Palestinian elections is a key to progress."
"Europe should make it clear that it will deal with those elected in new elections regardless of their political affiliation, on the basis of a commitment to implementing agreements accepted by the Palestinian people."
"European policy from now on concerning Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas must be predicated on the movement by them without delay into serious final status negotiations based on the Quartets Roadmap and the Arab Peace Initiative."
"We must insist that the Israeli siege of Gaza and the appalling human suffering that it is causing for the 1.5 million inhabitants should be lifted immediately and without preconditions."
"Unless Europe takes courageous steps now and encourages the USA to do likewise, the situation could very quickly become irretrievable."
"The current Spanish Presidency has been entrusted with the important task of drafting an action plan for implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"This plan must include among its most important objectives the whole package of issues dealing with immigration and asylum, border controls and security, as well as the fight against organised crime and terrorism."
"In a nutshell, guaranteeing EU citizens' security."
"Achieving these objectives will require, in the future, an even wider exchange of information between institutions and specialist agencies, as well as a consolidation of the EU database, therefore, the ongoing collection of citizens' personal data."
"However, a stable balance must be maintained between the provision of security and respect for the citizen's right to privacy."
"Consensus must be promoted between Member States with regard to finding a reasonable correlation between the two objectives mentioned."
"Respect for fundamental human rights must be the key objective of all European policies and must be given the most attention by the three countries which are going to hold the EU Presidency during the next 18 months."
"I wish the Spanish Presidency the greatest success."
"Spain is the first Member State to actually give life to the new institutional model that has come into force with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We hope that the priority already stated by Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero - to pull Europe out of the crisis and consolidate the resumption of economic growth - will be realised, and that we can continue to combat climate change and defend energy security."
"It is also important to adopt an integrated forestry policy and pursue greater efficiency in water management."
"In this European Year for Combating Poverty and at this time of economic crisis, we hope that there will be consolidated policies for the most vulnerable in society."
"I hope that the Member States and the European institutions will cooperate so that the EU will become more prosperous and united, and will have a greater presence on the international stage."
"I also hope that relations between Portugal and Spain will be strengthened through this Presidency."
"Everyone is aware of the interdependence and interconnectivity between our respective economies."
"A good example of unity of effort is the Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, in Braga, which will allow the development of scientific research, innovation and knowledge, leading to greater competitiveness for our companies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office has put forward his priorities."
"They are all important matters, but the deafening silence regarding the fight against illegal immigration, defined as a non priority, is unmistakeable."
"No reference is made to strengthening the FRONTEX programme, or to the need to make the agreements on the allocation of refugees more binding; no commitment has been made to increase our cooperation with the countries of departure of illegal migrants, or to support, within the UN, the need to establish in-situ identification centres for asylum seekers, which will verify who is really eligible for asylum."
"This shortcoming is a very serious indication that we are diverging from the positions recently reaffirmed by the European Council and from the position of the Italian Government, which has always fought to put matters relating to immigration control at the top of the European agenda."
"I hope that the Spanish Presidency, beyond making general appeals regarding human rights, can review its priorities and act on the immigration-related commitments made by previous Presidencies-in-Office."
"We will continue to put pressure on Mr Zapatero and his government until this occurs."
"I welcome the fact that the programme of the Spanish Presidency lists ensuring equal opportunities for women and men as a priority regarding the European labour market, along with agricultural development and relations with third countries."
"It is also welcome that the programme lays emphasis on the fight against gender-based violence and the protection of victims of such crimes, while also stressing among the general goals the role gender equality plays in the growth of the European Union."
"It is an extremely important development that, in the chapter on anti-discrimination, the Presidency commits to reducing the existing wage gap between men and women, promoting the gender equality roadmap 2011-2015, establishing a European Monitoring Centre on Gender Based Violence, and organising a forum assessing the result to date and future challenges of the UN's 'Beijing Platform for Action'."
"Although the programme does not mention its plans for the social integration of the Roma people, I truly hope the Presidency will continue the work started by its predecessors and, in light of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, will use all means to support the social and economic integration of the Roma people, the largest and most vulnerable minority in Europe."
"I further hope that at the summit to take place on International Roma Day in Córdoba, the Spanish Presidency will also contribute greatly to the rapid finalisation of the European Roma Strategy currently being shaped."
"I am glad to hear about the 'Innovating Europe' programme introduced by the Spanish Presidency, because it has set the acceleration of developing a policy on tourism as a priority, including giving consideration to the viewpoints of tourists regarding the EU policies related to the industry."
"To this end, the Presidency is focusing on creating a European model of tourism, taking into account group tourism as well."
"I call your attention to the fact that the interests of persons with disabilities should also be given maximum consideration."
"Furthermore, in the field of transport, the Presidency proposes to support intelligent transport systems, which I fully agree with, and I take the opportunity here to repeat: the European Union should discontinue the legal practice of adopting and keeping in force as many regulations as there are means of transport."
"At present, people with different transport needs are not provided with the same level of transport services, in spite of all having the same passengers' rights."
"I suggest the Presidency take into consideration the statement made by Siim Kallas, Commissioner-designate, in which he referred to free movement as one of the most fundamental freedoms of European citizens, manifested in modern transport."
"The Commissioner-designate agreed with the initiative, and promised to create a uniform Code of Conduct pertaining to all sectors of transport."
"By doing so, he can ensure during his mandate that all European citizens have clear and transparent rights, and the Spanish Presidency could and should play an important role in this."
"I am very pleased that the Neighbourhood Policy is among the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"I know how important it is to Spain to develop cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, and the importance Spain attaches to the concept of the Union for the Mediterranean region."
"I understand, of course, that this concerns many countries which are neighbours of the EU and important economic partners of the Union."
"I was even more pleased to hear the declarations of Mr Zapatero and other representatives of the Spanish Presidency that they want to continue the efforts of their predecessors, especially the Czechs and the Swedes, to develop cooperation with the EU's eastern neighbours, in particular, the states included in the Eastern Partnership programme proposed by Poland and Sweden."
"In this context, I would like to appeal to the Presidency, and personally to Mr Zapatero, to take a special interest in the situation in Belarus."
"It is extremely important to rethink strategy towards Belarus and to monitor the country's internal politics."
"The EU should demand that the Belarusian authorities respect human rights and change their attitude to the institution of civil society."
"Mr Zapatero emphasised the importance of human rights."
"Unfortunately, prisoners of conscience are still being held in Belarus, and the attitude of the authorities to the democratic opposition, free media and non-governmental organisations, including ethnic minority organisations, falls far short of European standards."
"Democratisation and respect for basic civil rights is a factor which should be a condition for the development of cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the Eastern Partnership."
"One of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency is stimulation of the EU economy, which is to be achieved by approval and realisation of the European strategy for sustainable development by 2020."
"The document presented by the Commission shows that this mainly concerns promoting a knowledge-based and more environmentally friendly economy."
"Another idea put forward by Spain was a system of financial penalties, consisting, for example, of a reduction in subsidies from the EU budget for countries which do not achieve the objectives contained in the strategy."
"Spain is now going back on this idea, in response to resistance from many countries and interest groups."
"I have, however, a question: why were consultations not carried out before announcing such a revolutionary idea?"
"Does Spain not realise, bearing in mind its own experience, that poorer countries might have problems meeting such ambitious conditions, not because of a lack of will, but because they are not able?"
"Do you not think, Mr Zapatero, that the introduction of additional penalties will cause an effect opposite to the one intended, that it will lead to the appearance of still greater disproportions in the development of particular regions, and that this will weaken the entire Union?"
"We all want a strong Union, and a strong Union means a Union of strong parts."
"The policy of evening out the differences between regions is working, so let us not squander its results with drastic measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has assumed the task of guaranteeing the European Union's energy security as a priority."
"With this in mind, diversification of gas supply sources is vital by completing the Nabucco Project in good time."
"After signing the Intergovernmental Agreement on Nabucco, the European Union must take action."
"I would like to emphasise that the Spanish Presidency's priorities must also include relations with the Eastern Partnership states."
"In this regard, I believe it is important for us to give powerful political support to the successful completion of the negotiations which started recently between the EU and the Republic of Moldova."
"These negotiations must lead to the signing of an Association Agreement, marking a significant step in the implementation of European values in this European state in the EU's immediate vicinity."
"I think that it is vital for us to send out a positive signal to the Republic of Moldova's citizens, the majority of whom declared themselves in favour of the Coalition for European Integration at the 2009 elections."
"It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling for us to combat the economic crisis and wants to make implementation of the economic policy objectives mandatory."
"Coming from a country whose unemployment rate, at almost 20%, is twice the European average, this sounds absurd."
"What is even worse is that it is promoting the old idea of European economic governance."
"Such violation of the principle of subsidiarity must be rejected in the strongest possible terms."
"The EU must remain a union of diversity and of nation states - it owes that to its citizens."
"It also owes it to its citizens to finally do some plain talking in the negotiations with Turkey."
"The Spanish Presidency is shutting its eyes to reality, in other words, to the fact that Turkey is not part of Europe, either geographically or from a spiritual and cultural point of view."
"Ethnic and religious minorities are still being discriminated against in this Anatolian country and Ankara stubbornly refuses to recognise Cyprus, which is an EU Member State."
"To say here that the conflict that has been going on for decades will shortly bring 'positive results' is nothing more than a pious wish."
"For financial reasons alone, the EU could not cope with Turkey's accession."
"A mass influx of Turks and exploding parallel societies would finally finish the EU off."
"It is high time that we ceased our accession negotiations with Ankara at once and worked to secure a privileged partnership."
"I welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency is assuming in the agricultural sector priorities which are really the most important among the objectives during this period: the continuation of the debates on the future of the common agricultural policy and the adjustment of the common agricultural policy to the ever-changing realities of present-day Europe."
"Furthermore, I noticed other important ideas in the Spanish Presidency's programme: guaranteeing sufficient resources for European agriculture and continuing the process of phasing out milk quotas according to the results of the Health Check."
"Last but not least, I welcome the discussions already under way during the first session of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on Monday on a better functioning food supply chain in order to control price fluctuations and ensure a fairer distribution of the surplus within this chain."
"All these are ambitious objectives and, at the same time, of fundamental importance to Europe's citizens."
"Thank you, Mr Zapatero, for your inaugural speech."
"However, it lacked a clear reference to the problem of huge deficits."
"I cannot imagine that the Spanish Presidency will not take up this problem and make it a priority."
"Mr Zapatero, the situation not only in Greece, but also in Spain and other countries, would appear to be your most important task."
"Are you not afraid that, if you do not bring public finances in Spain under control, there will not be any money for the purchase of your 'electric cars'?"
"You must be told that the cavalier policies of some European governments, including the Spanish Government, are reducing Europe's competitiveness, limiting the numbers of jobs available in Europe and putting off enlargement of the euro area with new countries, and all because of Europe's internal instability."
"Please face up to this challenge very seriously."
"You are obliged to do so."
"The Spanish Presidency comes just as the Treaty of Lisbon is entering into force."
"The practices which will be developed in relations between the permanent President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the one hand, and other Community institutions and leaders of Member States, on the other, depend in large measure on the Presidency which is just beginning."
"I would like to appeal, here, for the new institutions to be given the maximum recognition, in accordance with the letter of the treaty and the spirit of the reform being undertaken."
"It is important that the European Union speak in the international arena with one voice."
"It is even more important, however, that its voice should not be ignored, but that it should create new trends and have a key influence when decisions are being made."
"To avoid a repeat of the situation at the COP 15 conference, the Presidency must take action already to create a climate which will make it possible to take decisions at the COP 16 summit which accord with the position of the European Union."
"The Union must also speak with unanimity about the fight against the crisis and building a new financial order."
"It is the role of the Presidency to take an active interest in all kinds of intellectual reflection on changes in the European economic and social model which have resulted from conclusions drawn during the current economic crisis."
"For my part, however, I am counting on sympathetic support from the Presidency for work on reform of the common agricultural policy."
"This will soon be one of the most important political questions in the European Union."
"The plan of the Spanish Presidency includes important objectives which must be achieved, thanks to which we will be able to feel secure in a competitive and economically strong Europe."
"Most important among them, I think, are three matters:"
"1."
"Resolute and rapid action to slow down rising unemployment."
"The creation of new jobs requires much preparatory work and large financial support, including for market research and training."
"The year 2010 is the best time for people to raise their qualifications and even to retrain, in accordance with the needs of an economy which is coming out of a crisis."
"2."
"The fight against domestic violence, including the proposed draft directive on EU protection for the victims of domestic violence."
"The scale of this phenomenon in Europe leaves no doubt that many women feel least secure in their own home."
"This is an absurd situation, and it also compromises the Member States of the EU, because they are not coping with this very important social problem."
"Politicians are very much at fault here, because they do not sufficiently oppose violence against women and often pretend that it does not exist on such a large scale."
"The lack of support in the European Parliament for a resolution against violence against women was compromising for the Right."
"Fortunately, the resolution was passed by votes from the Left."
"3."
"Further action in the fight against discrimination, including progress on a new directive against various forms of discrimination, and severe penalties for countries which delay implementation of EU anti-discrimination legislation."
"Once again, the Spanish Presidency of the EU has come at a crucial time."
"Eight years ago, in the first half of 2002, Spain had to face up to the challenge of introducing the euro as a common currency."
"Now, the Spanish Presidency stands before an equally momentous task - implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The division of competences between the Member State Presidency and the President of the European Council will be of great significance."
"Giving priority to foreign policy which strengthens the Union's position in the world arena is worthy of support."
"However, will the newly appointed High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy do this?"
"These fears result from Mrs Ashton's statements and her past, but also from her first actions since taking office."
"I do not suppose we need to convince anyone that the fight against the crisis and its negative economic and social consequences is still necessary."
"Such action is especially in the interest of Spain, which has been hit by the recession exceptionally hard."
"How can we return to maintaining the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact by both large and small Member States?"
"How should the fight against the crisis in Europe and the world be coordinated?"
"An additional challenge resulting from the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon is the necessity to arrange cooperation within the Trio Presidency."
"Spain is going to have to coordinate its work with Belgium and Hungary."
"It is especially important to ensure a smooth transition between individual presidencies so that continuity of work is maintained."
"I wish the Spanish Presidency success."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Spanish Presidency very warmly."
"I must admit that I have specific expectations of this Presidency."
"Firstly, because one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency is energy security."
"I am very pleased to note this fact."
"This is something which should be a priority of each successive Presidency."
"I would like to stress that the Solidarity Action Plan is a very important element of energy security."
"Continuation and acceleration of work on its introduction is an absolutely crucial matter."
"I agree with the principles of the Spanish Presidency related to measures for controlling climate change."
"I would like to draw attention to how important it is to coordinate the process of informing European Union citizens of ways in which they can fight climate change themselves."
"As the recent Copenhagen Summit showed, the will of politicians on its own cannot change much."
"In connection with this, we must involve Europeans as fully as possible and convince them that climate change is not an abstract process, but is something which, on the contrary, affects everyone individually and all of us together."
"As a representative of Hungary - and part of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency - I welcome the Spanish Presidency."
"It is truly rare to hear a visiting prime minister have such a clear vision about the future of the EU and the programme of the Presidency like we did this morning from Mr Zapatero."
"I agree with the notion that without implementing an economic union, the global competitiveness of Europe is at risk."
"The four priorities for the next ten years listed by Mr Zapatero in fact determine the most important strategic targets."
"It is in the interests of the Union as a whole, but especially of the new Member States, including Hungary, to reduce their dependence on energy."
"Without 'green economic growth', a digital market, establishing a common innovative capacity and the true development of European education, the Union has no potential for renewal."
"I also warmly welcome the decision of the Spanish Presidency to speed up the debate on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"Time is pressing: first, we need to develop the CAP framework and then use it as a basis for the budget, and not the other way around."
"Otherwise, the beneficiaries of CAP and the whole Community itself would lose a great deal."
"The Hungarian Agricultural Academy is an important venue for discussing the future of CAP in Hungary;"
"I hope the Spanish Presidency will be able to attend its 2010 event."
"The Spanish Presidency comes at a strategically important time for Europe."
"The fact that it comes just as the Treaty of Lisbon is entering into force increases its accountability for the effective application of the new treaty, which is a prerequisite for the development of its programme."
"I am eagerly looking forward to the debate on the future of Cohesion Policy, and trying to make sure it includes the issue of territorial cohesion."
"As an MEP from one of Europe's outermost regions, my attention is focused on what the new Presidency will do with development policy for island regions."
"The EU-Morocco Summit is sure to be an ideal forum for galvanising the Euro-African Atlantic Cooperation Area, particularly through cooperation between Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries and neighbouring countries."
"It will receive my full commitment."
"Because of its geographical and historical proximity, Portugal, and its outermost regions in particular, such as Madeira, are looking forward to seeing how the Spanish Presidency intends to implement and develop a new European strategy for these regions."
"Within this context, I will be closely following the actions of the Presidency as it implements the recommendations that the Commission made in The outermost regions: an asset for Europe, and the discussion of future financial perspectives."
"The Spanish Presidency must finalise the institutional arrangements for the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Defining the new comitology rules is a key element of the legislative process."
"There are several dossiers, including the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Intelligent Transport Systems Directive, whose adoption depends on how quickly these rules for institutional cooperation will be drawn up."
"In addition, the economic crisis is having a severe impact on European citizens, who are losing their jobs and hoping that measures will be outlined for facilitating economic recovery."
"The EU 2020 Strategy must find solutions to meet these expectations."
"This is why the European Union's trio format made up of the Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian presidencies must strengthen Social Europe by creating jobs and improving living conditions for European citizens."
"Last but not least, 2010 marks the mid-term point of the financial outlook for the 2007-2013 period."
"This year, Member States have a unique opportunity to review the Operational Programmes in order to maximise the absorption of European funds and implement projects which can create jobs and improve European citizens' quality of life."
"I urge the Spanish Presidency, along with all Member States, to make the most of the mid-term review with the aim of achieving economic recovery in the 2012-2013 period."
"The priorities of the Spanish Presidency for the effective application of the reactionary 'Lisbon Treaty' and to promote the continuation of the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy with the EU-2020 strategy, strengthen the CDSP, and strike at democratic rights and freedoms under the Stockholm Programme are the priorities of the plutocracy."
"The Spanish Presidency's programme maps the haste of euro-unifying capital to promote capitalist restructurings and to continue its attack on the rights and standard of living of the working and grassroots classes unabated."
"This attack has as its focal point wage and pension cuts, the full dismantling of industrial relations, the general application of flexible and temporary forms of employment, the demolition of national insurance systems and farmers' incomes, with drastic cuts in the Community budget for agriculture and livestock farming and cuts in social benefits, as well as the commercialisation of health, welfare and education, by raising the spectre of 'public deficits' and the application of the Stability Pact."
"The way chosen by euro-unifying monopoly capital is to strengthen the imperialist policy of the EU with new political and strategic intervention mechanisms, such as the 'European External Action Service', to strengthen its militarisation with 'combat groups' and to increase their penetration with NATO."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is going to lead the Union for the fourth time."
"However, it will do so for the first time under new principles, and will, for the first time, carry out its work in connection with the new institutions provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These circumstances give particular significance to Spain's role and increase its responsibility, in view of the fact that the financial crisis and changes in Europe coincide with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"After a reasonably successful Czech Presidency and the professional Swedes, the eyes of Europe are turned on the Iberian Peninsula."
"The priorities which have been presented, that is: work on the rights of the European citizen, economic revival and financial control, upholding justice and developing a strategy for the internal security of the states of Europe, and all this when the new treaty is coming into force with full effect, are very ambitious."
"Spain stands before a huge opportunity and a great challenge, because the new legislation has to be converted into specific action and adapted to the dynamically changing world situation."
"Leading the European Union at a time of global financial crisis is no easy matter."
"All the more, I wait impatiently for results, and I wish you success with the introduction of the 'new Europe project'. Thank you."
"* * *"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian police force last night arrested five people who were planning a mafia attack on one of our colleagues, Mr Crocetta, a Member of this Parliament and a former mayor of the Sicilian town of Gela."
"According to the magistrates, the attack could have taken place on any given day, starting from today, 20 January."
"I would remind you that the Belgian authorities have yet to provide a suitable escort for Mr Crocetta, who has been under protection in Italy for some time now, as Parliament's Presidency is aware."
"I would ask the Presidency to show solidarity with our colleague on behalf of this House and of the European Parliament and to take action to ensure that Mr Crocetta receives adequate protection in his role as an MEP."

"Election of the European Ombudsman (vote)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate Nikiforos Diamandouros on being elected European Ombudsman."
"As was pointed out in his report from last year, the crucial work is about building citizens' trust in the EU, and we can all subscribe to that."
"We all have an important role to contribute to that important work, both as institutions and as individuals."
"Relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman have always been very good and very constructive."
"I think our cooperation has become even smoother and more productive."
"Through his inquiries, the European Ombudsman and his team have done a lot to help develop and reinforce a culture of service within the Commission."
"Very important lessons have been drawn from critical remarks made, and we also see an increase in the willingness to achieve friendly solutions."
"This development should continue, and I know the Commission will continue to follow closely the Ombudsman's activities and welcome his proposals."
"The years to come are going to be interesting and challenging for the Ombudsman."
"I am, of course, thinking about the new possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As you all know, the right to good administration is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I am in no doubt that the Ombudsman will enhance his contribution to strengthening democracy in Europe."
"The tools are transparency and service-minded institutions."
"We all have a responsibility to support him in that work."
"So, again, congratulations on your appointment, and I wish you all the best for the very important tasks that lie ahead of all of us."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) With this vote, the European Parliament has expressed its confidence in the European Ombudsman, whose mandate will last until the end of our parliamentary term."
"I must point out that this is a positive vote for all of us, for all European citizens."
"The European Ombudsman will deal with citizens' complaints concerning the maladministration of our institutions."
"The Ombudsman has responded before Parliament, he has answered questions concerning how to make his own work more transparent, how to improve cooperation between Parliament and the Ombudsman's officers, as well as communication with the public."
"His role will be very important in defending European citizens, in helping them in their contacts with public administration, and perhaps also in making European citizens feel they are in a common Europe."
"Reducing what is, at times, an unproductive burden of bureaucracy is an objective that we must all work towards."
"The European Union will be even more political if it is able to put citizens at the heart of its action."
"This is why I hope that the new Ombudsman will be able to apply past experiences to further improve the positive relationship with European citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our rapporteur, Mrs Joly, and all the political groups, have done an excellent job of drafting this report, which I, along with my colleagues from the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), strongly support."
"In particular, I would like to express my support for the part of the report in which it is highlighted that negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement should take account, on the one hand, of the consequences of the financial crisis, and, on the other, of migration and, above all, of the need to curb illegal immigration."
"This, in fact, has a very negative impact, both on the economies of the ACP countries, which, as a result of immigration, are losing the labour force and the qualified workers that are necessary for development, and on those EU countries that are the worst hit by illegal immigration, countries such as Italy, whose capacity to absorb immigrants has economic and occupational limits that cannot be exceeded if a social decline is to be avoided."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Joly report even though I believe we all agree on one of its central arguments, namely that we need to conduct a policy that focuses on promoting the economic development of the African countries themselves, in order to combat the brain drain and enable skilled Africans to devote themselves to the development of their own countries at long last."
"I understand and support this."
"Why, then, does the same report argue so stubbornly in favour of a policy of new emigration from African countries and of new immigration to Europe?"
"After all, this actually promotes the brain drain of the most skilled, dynamic and enterprising Africans."
"I maintain that the 'Blue Card' is disastrous for Europe and particularly harmful to Africa and the African people."
"The 'circular migration' that is mentioned, last but not least, is a pipe dream, as these immigrants do not return home and a new breeding ground for illegal immigration is created."
"Mr President, our agenda this week, and today particularly, has been thin, meagre and truncated."
"We all know why."
"The week has been given over to backroom manoeuvring."
"I would say manoeuvring in smoke-filled rooms but, this being Brussels, I will say smoke-free rooms."
"We have come through this nonsense of the hearings."
"It has produced candidates concerning whom I have to say that I have not heard of a single Member of this House who thinks we are now about to appoint the 27 best-qualified men and women in the whole of the European Union to the awesome powers concentrated in the hands of the European Commission."
"Not only will they be the executive, they will also have the right to initiate law - a concentration of power that is extraordinary in any context, but all the more so when we bear in mind that they are not directly answerable to the electorate."
"This is the most exclusive electorate in Europe - 736 MEPs get to decide who will run the continent."
"You do not have to be a eurosceptic to find that objectionable."
"It seems to me extraordinary that this continent, which exported the idea of representative government and parliamentary democracy, which carried the seeds of democracy to far continents where they found fertile soil, should now have taken the axe to the ancestral tree here in Europe."
"All of us are diminished by that process."
"Mr President, when considering EU-ACP relations, surely the first principle should be how we help take people out of poverty in many of these countries."
"When I speak to entrepreneurs in these countries, they complain to me about how, even 40 years after independence for many of them, they have suffered from the problems of 40 years of socialism, where they are still dependent on primary economies and also over-dependent on aid."
"The entrepreneurs in these countries also tell me how trade barriers actually harm these countries and how it makes imports of food and medicines more expensive for the very poorest citizens."
"They complain about EU tariff and non-tariff barriers, and I am glad that the EU-ACP goes some way to tackling some of the tariff barriers, if not the non-tariff barriers."
"I am also pleased that the Commission has actually set up a unit that helps entrepreneurs in developing countries to export into the EU."
"We must remember the first principle is that the best way to help the poorest out of poverty is to encourage more trade and to help the entrepreneurs in poorer countries."
"(NL) Mr President, paragraph 31 alone, which calls on the Commission to include the principle of circular migration and its facilitation by granting circular visas, was sufficient reason to vote against the Joly report."
"'Circular migration' is a mirage."
"It is something that exists in official EU documents and the like but not - with a few exceptions - in the real world."
"What circular migration boils down to is that an immigrant is granted a limited residence permit but remains in Europe after its expiry date and goes underground."
"This is the reality of so-called circular migration."
"Circular migration is a driving force for illegal immigration; the Commission knows it and Parliament knows it too."
"Nevertheless, this term is used time and time again to make people believe that many immigrants return to their countries of origin further down the line."
"We would do well, therefore, to stop covering up reality as soon as possible."
"Mr President, with your permission, I just want to make a point regarding time-keeping because far too often here in this House, too many people are going way over their time - and they are allowed to do so."
"Some take nearly double the time allotted."
"I would appeal to the President and Vice-Presidents to use their gavel to effect, so that time-keeping is within the rules and that those who want to come in on catch-the-eye, etc. have an opportunity to do so."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Mr President, the role of the European Ombudsman for the citizens is of vital importance for the proper functioning and the transparency of the European institutions, which represent some 27 Member States and almost 500 million citizens."
"I would like to focus, in this House, on the importance of the Ombudsman's role in the protection of EU languages, given the numerous complaints received in the past few years concerning linguistic discrimination, complaints which have also concerned the Italian language."
"I am therefore delighted by the reappointment of the European Ombudsman and, as well as wishing him well in his work, I invite him to pay due attention to linguistic protection."
"I welcome the re-election of Nikiforos Diamandouros to the office of European Ombudsman for another term until 2014."
"I also support the Ombudsman in his following primary objectives: to ensure that the European Union's citizens will enjoy the benefits and resources of the Treaty of Lisbon and to achieve better cooperation with national and regional ombudsmen, thereby ensuring greater transparency of activity at European level."
"in writing. - I fully support the re-election Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros to the office of European Ombudsman."
"The European Ombudsman investigates complaints against the institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"The Ombudsman must be an independent, non-partisan and impartial public servant."
"Mr Diamandouros has proven himself to be a highly professional and efficient advocate on behalf of the citizen."
"He has not been fearful of being critical of any European Institution, including the European Parliament, when necessary."
"Now that the Charter of Fundamental rights has the same legal value as the treaties, I am confident that the charter, and especially, the right to good administration, will be at the heart of Mr Diamandouros' work as Ombudsman."
"In a Europe that wishes to be closer to citizens and more at the service of the people of Europe, it is essential that those people are able to exercise effective control over the institutions and bodies of the EU."
"This is precisely where the role of the European Ombudsman proves to be indispensable, as the citizens report to him any administrative irregularities, discrimination, abuse of power or absence, or the refusal to answer a specific question put to an EU institution or body."
"In this regard, I welcome the election of the new European Ombudsman for the next five years, and hope that in his mandate, he will be guided by the founding values of the European Union - liberty and justice."
"This will ensure that European citizens have better institutions and effective control over them, making the EU stronger, fairer and more united."
"The European Ombudsman acts in order to tackle cases of poor administration by Community institutions and bodies, either on his own initiative, or by following up a complaint."
"This means that the European Ombudsman is helping to construct a Europe of Citizens just as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become legally binding."
"It should be noted that the right to good administration is a fundamental right for European citizens, enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"In 2001, the European Parliament approved a resolution on the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which must be respected by the institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"I would argue that this code should become a European law, which would have legislative coherence in the EU and would be a guarantee that those very basic principles would be adhered to by its institutions when dealing with citizens."
"It is crucial that European citizens know their rights and how they can go about protecting them and recovering them if they are violated."
"Mr President, in the European Parliament, we have, in fact, evaluated Mr Diamandouros' work as Ombudsman every year when we debated the annual reports he submitted, and they have always received top marks."
"In the course of his work during two terms of office, Mr Diamandouros has undertaken numerous initiatives to raise awareness of the office of Ombudsman, which has meant that increasing numbers of citizens have been using his help."
"The latest figures, which come from 2008, show 3 406 complaints in comparison with 3 211 the year before."
"It is worth noting the fact that the Ombudsman has not restricted himself just to examining complaints which are formally admissible, but has also given information about the possibility of claiming rights in the case of complaints which do not, in fact, come within his remit."
"In addition, Mr Diamandouros has initiated very valuable cooperation between ombudsmen of the individual Member States, which has enabled exchange of information and good practices."
"On his initiative, liaison officers have been appointed in the offices of national ombudsmen, and information on the implementation and application of EU law is published in the 'Ombudsman Newsletter'."
"Therefore, I sincerely congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his achievements and on his re-election as European Ombudsman, and am counting on fruitful cooperation during the current term of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - Dear colleagues, I rise today in appreciation of the work of our ombudsman, Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros."
"He has executed his duties in line with all of the rules and he has done so with independence and integrity."
"He is someone who is championing the principal that EU institutions must be transparent."
"Let's be frank colleagues; our citizens are not as engaged in European affairs as we would like them to be."
"Therefore, it is necessary that our EU institutions operate as if from behind a pane of glass."
"This ombudsman has so far demonstrated an ability to operate with this principal so I welcome his re-appointment. Many thanks."
"in writing. - I am very pleased that Nikiforos Diamandouros has been re-elected as European Ombudsman."
"He has been a very good champion of citizens' rights, and I am pleased he will continue in this role."
"In the vote to elect the Ombudsman, I voted for Pierre-Yves Monette."
"He was the only one to take the trouble to introduce himself to the non-attached Members of the European Parliament and to answer their questions."
"We have, today, reached a decision on the election of the European Ombudsman."
"This election is extremely important for the citizens of the European Union, because the European Ombudsman deals with the protection of human rights."
"He examines complaints made by EU citizens about improprieties in European institutions."
"In this way, Europeans have a certain kind of control over every body, office, institution and agency of the Union."
"Therefore, it is extremely important that our citizens be aware of their rights."
"They need to know that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, their influence on the functioning of EU institutions has increased."
"In addition, according to the new ombudsman, the European Ombudsman is going to work more closely with other European institutions."
"It is also pleasing that citizens of the new Member States are making use of the possibility to lodge a complaint, which is testified by the relatively high number of complaints recorded in previous years."
"This shows that the residents of the new Member States are interested in issues connected with the European Union and are not indifferent to the EU."
"I voted in favour of the report on the temporary suspension of the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira, as this aims to increase the competitiveness of economic operators from the Azores (manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers)."
"This would ensure more stable employment in the Azores and thus overcome the economic disadvantages that exist due to the islands' location."
"This temporary suspension of taxes, allowing local economic operators in the Azores and Madeira to import a certain amount of raw materials, parts, components and finished products duty-free, covering areas such as fishing, agriculture, industry and services, provides favourable conditions for long-term investment."
"These measures will also go some way to helping small and medium-sized enterprises and local farmers, allowing them to create jobs and invest in the outermost regions."
"Given the current economic crisis, the need for specific measures to stimulate economic activity and stabilise jobs is paramount."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the proposal for a Council regulation temporarily suspending autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores on the basis of the report by my excellent Polish colleague, Mrs Hübner."
"The regional authorities of Madeira and the Azores, in agreement with the government of their Member State, Portugal, have requested the temporary suspension of Common Customs Tariff duties to promote the competitiveness of local economic operators and to stabilise employment in these outermost regions of the Union."
"I am completely in favour of the Union supporting the special features of the outermost territories, provided that such tolerance does not feed speculation or deviate from its intended objective."
"I support the Commission's proposal on the temporary suspension of the application of Common Customs Tariff duties, as I believe that the EU must demonstrate, and not just declare its solidarity with regions fighting the consequences of the economic crisis."
"I believe this measure is coordinated with the European Economic Recovery Plan, because the economic crisis has affected different EU Member States and EU regions in different ways, and therefore we must ensure that there are measures to meet the specific economic needs of each Member State or region."
"Since these islands are dependent on tourism, and tourism is in decline, there is a growing threat of unemployment and the collapse of small and medium-sized business and this would hit the inhabitants of these far off islands particularly hard."
"By applying the customs exemption, the Community must also ensure that this measure ensures the basic objective - to promote local enterprise and help local farmers and small and medium-sized businesses to survive this difficult period - and that these principles are applied to other EU Member States."
"The development of the outermost regions is severely hampered by factors such as the structure of society and the economy, extreme remoteness and insularity, their small size, difficult terrain and climate, and their economic dependency."
"This means that it is vital that the European Union continues to pay special attention to these regions, identifying problems and areas of potential, studying their differences and weaknesses, so that it can implement policies and measures that are suitable for their economic and social development."
"I welcome the proposal for a Council regulation, as this represents an incentive for sustainable development and the integration of the outermost regions into the world economy."
"The temporary suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties will allow the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores to overcome the economic disadvantages that arise from their geographical location, and also tackle the specific effects that they are experiencing due to the economic crisis."
"I applaud the initiative by the regional authorities of Madeira and the Azores and their commitment in contributing to a development strategy for their regions, which also contributes to the competitiveness of the European Union, and its capacity for sustainable economic development."
"I voted in favour of the report on the temporary suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports certain industrial products into the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores."
"This suspension will help to strengthen the competitiveness of local economic operators and will contribute to creating and maintaining jobs in the outermost regions, acting as a counterbalance to the economic disadvantages arising from their geographical location, without affecting the consolidation of the internal market or the principle of free competition within the EU."
"I believe that the temporary suspension of autonomous customs duties is essential in order to strengthen the competitiveness of economic operators in the Portuguese Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores, so as to ensure more stable employment on these islands."
"This suspension will allow local economic operators on Madeira and the Azores to import raw materials, parts, components and finished products duty-free, since these products are to be used locally, for processing or manufacturing."
"The approval of this exception is crucial for the development of these Portuguese Autonomous Regions, both of which rely heavily on the tourism industry and are consequently highly vulnerable to the volatility of this sector."
"This means that their full economic development is limited by the characteristics of their local economy and their geographical position."
"In the light of this, any incentive for local industry certainly provides support necessary for improving the living conditions for local people, and opens the way for the creation of jobs on the islands, which is essential for retaining people and creating conditions for development."
"The temporary suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties will allow local economic operators in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores to import a certain quota of raw materials, parts, components and finished products duty-free."
"These raw materials will have to be used in farming and for industrial processing and maintenance in the autonomous regions."
"This suspension will be in force until 31 December 2019, and measures are expected to be put in place to prevent this giving rise to any unfair competition."
"This strengthens the competitiveness of SMEs and farmers in our autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores."
"This measure is tailored to the specific needs of these outermost regions, and will stimulate economic activity, thus helping to stabilise employment."
"The local economies of Madeira and the Azores largely depend on domestic and international tourism, which have been affected by the current economic crisis."
"This means that this suspension is completely justified, and it is expected to have a positive impact on the economic development of these regions."
"I would like to call for swifter analysis and decision making in these kinds of processes, so that we can respond to them in a more efficient and timely manner."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"The regional authorities of Madeira and the Azores called for the introduction of the temporary suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products, with the aim of strengthening and ensuring more stable productivity and employment in these outermost regions."
"We agree with the content of the proposals contained in the document. However, we believe that components which fall outside the agricultural purposes stipulated in the regulation could also be considered as components for industrial purposes, particularly in the field of energy and the environment, such as parts and components for the energy industry, especially so-called 'clean energy' (wind power, solar power, etc.)"
"The suspension of the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores until 2019 is very important for these outermost regions of the EU at this time of global economic crisis."
"It is vital for helping SMEs and local farmers, as it will strengthen the competitiveness of local economic operators and ensure more stable employment in these regions."
"The regional authorities of Madeira and the Azores have requested the temporary suspension of the Common Customs Tariff duties in order to strengthen the competitive position of the local economic operators and stabilise employment in these outermost regions of the Union."
"In order to ensure that the goods imported, be they raw materials parts or finished products, do not distort competition, they will be subject to controls ensuring their use by local companies on the islands for a period of at least two years before they can be sold freely to companies situated in other parts of the Union."
"How is that to be implemented in practice?"
"As no plausible clarification can be given, I have abstained from the vote."
"I welcome the position that the Commission has taken on the 10-year suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores, and the report by Mrs Hübner, which together:"
"1. Establish positive discrimination in favour of the outermost regions of the Azores and Madeira, acknowledging that the structural limitations that affect these regions are permanent by their very nature;"
"2. Create conditions for stimulating economic activity and employment in the island groups, thus also contributing to demographic stability in the islands."
"This is an example of the cohesion that can be achieved by a European Union built on the principle of solidarity."
"The development of the outermost regions is circumscribed by their remoteness, insularity, climate and difficult geographical features, and their economic dependence on a limited number of goods and services."
"The regulation that we will vote upon today will allow Madeira and the Azores to import a range of finished products for agricultural, commercial or industrial use, along with raw materials, parts and components for use in agriculture, processing or industrial maintenance, with the benefit of exemption from customs duties until the end of 2019."
"Furthermore, this exemption will be extended to the whole territory of both regions, not only their duty-free zones, thus benefiting all types of local economic operators."
"I recall that this matter was subject to a simplified legislative procedure so as to speed it up."
"The Chair of the Committee on Regional Development herself was the rapporteur for the proposal, which has allowed it to be submitted to plenary for voting without it being put to debate."
"I am very happy with the final result, which incorporates the amendments that I proposed, covering a range of products to equip the Free Zone of Madeira, contained in a regulation from 2000 but having lapsed in 2008, along with additional requests presented in 2008 and 2009, which were not contained in the initial proposal by the Commission."
"The proposal from the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs proposing the appointment of Ana Palacio Vallelersundi to the panel set up under Article 255 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is, in principle, to be welcomed."
"However, from an institutional point of view, it is incomprehensible why a separate panel of seven people should make binding proposals to the national governments."
"I therefore voted against this proposal."
"In today's vote on the appointment of Ana Palacio Vallelersundi to the panel set up to assess candidates' suitability to perform the duties of judge or advocate-general in the Court of Justice and the General Court, I voted against the proposal, because, in addition to the candidates' first-rate legal knowledge, I expect the person appointed by the European Parliament also to examine their social suitability and competence."
"In this regard, I have no confidence in Mrs Palacio, because I fear that she would not take account of the possession of social values and an understanding of human nature when assessing the judges and advocates-general."
"Particularly in view of the stipulation of the goals and values in the Treaty of Lisbon - the social market economy has been mentioned here - and the enshrining of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in primary law, this will be absolutely essential in the selection of judges and advocates-general in future."
"The temporary suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores is intended to give a long-term perspective to investors and enable economic operators to reach a certain level of industrial and commercial activities."
"As a socialist, I believe that these measures should be retained for as long as these regions are facing major economic problems."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal because the adoption of this measure will bring stability to employment in the medium term and to the economic and social environment in these outermost regions of Europe which are faced with specific problems."
"However, I cannot but draw your attention to the risks which the temporary suspension of customs duties entails for products which have originated from such countries."
"This is why we must monitor closely the impact this suspension has on competition."
"In accordance with Article 255 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament is one of the institutions which proposes candidates to be members of the panel whose task it is to give an opinion on candidates' suitability to perform the duties of Judge and Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice."
"In view of the fact that there are only seven members of the panel and that their task is a very responsible one, it is important they be persons of impeccable reputation and high ability."
"As a Member of the European Parliament and thanks to the new powers given by the Treaty of Lisbon, I have an influence on the election of one of the seven people on the panel, and I am pleased with the candidature of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi was a Member of the European Parliament for eight years, and was twice elected by fellow Members as a member of the Conference of Committee Chairs."
"She was also Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs."
"In addition, her other professional achievements, such as holding the position of Chief Adviser to the World Bank and being Spain's first female Minister for Foreign Affairs, do not leave any doubt that she will be the right person in the right job."
"I voted in favour of the report on the revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement because I believe that this text contains key elements to be taken into account in the negotiations that are currently under way."
"The coherence of different European policies - whether in trade, development or agriculture and fishing - should be the principle foundation for our relations with this bloc of developing countries."
"The new situation, represented by strategic partnership agreements, must be taken into account."
"These agreements, which are essentially trade agreements, create new platforms for parliamentary dialogue and are to be respected."
"The new challenges that we are facing, such as climate change and the economic crisis, should give rise to responses that will be included in the new Cotonou Agreement, which is expected to be finalised in March."
"It is also important that the European strategy for relationships with ACP countries takes account of the closeness and contacts which the outermost regions have with these countries."
"The outermost regions can act as the prime intermediaries for the EU in economic partnership agreements."
"The outermost regions give a special dimension to external action by the EU, thus participating in the development of a genuine policy of broader neighbourhood."
"I voted in favour of the report by my fellow French Member, Mrs Joly, on the second revision of the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific)-EU Partnership Agreement ('Cotonou Agreement')."
"I share the positions of this report on the need to adapt the use of this special instrument with the ACP countries in the light of the current crises, such as climate change, soaring food and fuel prices, the financial crisis and extreme poverty in Africa."
"The ACP countries are partners of the European Union, and we must nurture this partnership with the aim of having allies in the major negotiations on global governance that are due to take place."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Second review of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (the Cotonou Agreement)."
"This is a timely report and it is right and proper that the issue of the Economic Partnership Agreement be discussed on a continuous basis."
"The primary aims of the Cotonou Agreement are to end poverty, to support sustainable development and to help ACP countries integrate with the global economy."
"The agreements and trade talks which are currently taking place, and those which will take place in the future, must move toward fulfilling and strengthening the provisions of the EU and its partners in relation to child labour."
"Article 50 of the Cotonou Agreement relates to the promotion of fair working standards and to the improvement of international measures to end child labour."
"Issues that relate to child labour must be given top priority in EU trade agreements."
"As such, I welcome the articles of the report which request that the EU and the ACP start discussions on the future of ACP-EU relations from 2020 onward and which recommend giving a larger role in this process to independent parties, i.e. organisations that are not states or governments."
"in writing. - The second revision of the Cotonou Agreement is taking place in a very challenging environment when the global economy is facing crisis."
"I believe that the revision of the agreement will allow the major principles of cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries to be refreshed and reinforced."
"The situation has changed since the agreement was first signed and new challenges and problems have arisen."
"The negotiations on the agreement should encompass such extremely important points as the fight against climate change in developing countries, the practical use of immense renewable energy resources, the food crisis and the acquisition of arable land."
"A lot of attention should be given to migration problems."
"In recent years, we have witnessed hundreds of young Africans drowning off the shores of the EU."
"Massive immigration is a result of failing economies, impoverishment of the people, human rights violations and many other causes."
"Those things should be addressed clearly in the revised agreement."
"in writing. - I am voting in favour of the draft report on the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement, which introduces key issues about sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the global economy."
"Issues such as climate change, energy security, training and cooperation in educational matters are essential for economic and social development in the ACP countries."
"Global warming, which predominantly affects developing countries, may also present an opportunity for us."
"The renewable energy resources that these countries have at their disposal are essential for their economic and social development, and allow them to move towards a state of energy independence, thus helping to tackle the global crisis."
"Likewise, investment in education and training is important in combating poverty, unemployment, illegal immigration and the brain drain, contributing to development in the ACP countries and helping them to build their own economy."
"in writing. - I support this report, which asserts that the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement must be consistent with the actual global crisis and be carried out in a way that fully respects a partnership of equals."
"This current second revision of the agreement is a great opportunity to address the root causes of the financial, climate change, food and energy crises, and to learn from past mistakes, bringing meaningful changes to the Cotonou framework, as well as enhancing ACP unity, cohesion and solidarity."
"The report calls for a stronger reinforcement of the human rights clauses and sanctions."
"Also the report expresses our regret that parliaments (European Parliament, JPA and national parliaments of the ACP countries) were not consulted by the Member States and had no input in the decision-making process leading to the identification of the areas and articles for revision and to the establishment of the negotiating mandate."
"The primary objective of the Cotonou Agreement is the reduction and, eventually, the eradication of poverty in a way consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy."
"I voted in favour of the report on the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement to defend the need for changes that will allow us to tackle the great challenges that we are currently facing, such as climate change, the financial crisis and the food crisis."
"I welcome the support that Parliament has given to the ACP countries, which want to see climate change addressed as a cross-cutting issue in the second revised version of the Cotonou Agreement."
"However, I regret that the parliaments (the European Parliament, the Pan-African Parliament and the national parliaments of the ACP countries) have not taken the opportunity to contribute with proposals and to participate actively with Member States in the decision-making process for revising this important agreement."
"I hope that the second revised version of the Cotonou Agreement will help to promote sustainable development in ACP countries, which will allow social cohesion and facilitate the fight against poverty."
"The effects of the crisis, linked to climate change, are severely felt in the ACP countries, and are becoming increasingly worse."
"In view of this, the issue of food sovereignty is a vital one."
"Natural resources should be used properly and the development of renewable energy should be encouraged."
"We need to guarantee that all the ACP countries will benefit from a commercial framework that is at least equivalent to the situation previously in force."
"I would also argue that the European Development Fund (EDF), which backs the cooperation policy for development within the scope of this agreement, should incorporate the budgetary powers of Parliament."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Like the rapporteur, we also believe that the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement is a good time to make amendments."
"The report sets out principles which, if implemented, would be a step towards improving the agreement, as illustrated by the defence of food sovereignty and security for ACP countries, along with the fight against tax havens."
"At the same time, I would condemn certain important aspects, such as the attempt to move towards greater regionalisation in ACP-EU relations, due to the threat that this would pose to the coherence and strength of the ACP group of states."
"Elsewhere, the report falls short of what is needed."
"The state of dependency and subordination to which the ACP countries are subject and the role that current policies on cooperation and development aid have played in establishing this state - a key issue - are not adequately addressed."
"The consequences that may arise from the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreements proposed by the EU within this context are not addressed either."
"The reservations and objections raised by several ACP countries should have been welcomed in the report, along with their priorities regarding, for instance, the European Development Fund."
"in writing. - Dear colleagues, it is with delight today that I address this parliament as we have moved towards a more equal role in the relationship between richer and poorer countries while strengthening human rights."
"The revision of this agreement must be consistent with the needs of the new world we live in and must be based on a partnership of equals."
"This is a new world with a new economy where fair distribution of wealth and tackling climate change are new priorities."
"I wish to commend the work of my own group in the European Parliament who have inserted those principles of eradication of poverty into this revision."
"This report undeniably contains some very valuable suggestions and often laudable intentions."
"The priority given to renewable energies, the obligation for multinationals operating in ACP countries to declare their profits and taxes, the incorporation of the concept of food sovereignty and the criticism of the externalisation by Europe of the management of migratory flows are all proposals that we support."
"However, we cannot ignore the fact that this report does not change anything in the Cotonou Agreement."
"That agreement is a symbol of the European Union's complete adherence to the ultra-liberal logic of the WTO."
"We are not taken in: the 'development' referred to is a front for the self-serving motivations which have dominated this dismantling of the Lomé agreements."
"We denounce the implementation of the European Partnership Agreements set out in that agreement, the Commission's use of blackmail in the form of development aid to ensure their conclusion, and the resultant pillaging of the economies of the ACP countries."
"We are voting against this text so as not to support the European Union's abandonment of the one economic cooperation instrument that is not governed by the obsession with free and undistorted competition or its bowing to the demands of the United States at the WTO."
"The recent tragedy that hit Haiti is proof that partnership agreements are not adequate for resolving problems."
"Therefore, this second revision of the Cotonou Agreement is an excellent opportunity to make adjustments relating to current challenges such as climate change, the steep increase in the price of food and petrol, the financial crisis, and the extreme deprivation in several ACP countries."
"This is the time to devise measures that will effectively solve the various problems that continue to affect the great majority of countries involved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various political groups on their excellent work on this report, which I fully support."
"Within the report, I would like to focus attention on the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In fact, such agreements should take account of varied critical aspects, such as the effects of the financial crisis, the increase in migratory flows and, above all, in illegal immigration."
"I am convinced that only an adequate assessment of economic cooperation would make it possible to control the negative impact of the crisis and its consequences, both for the economy of ACP countries, which are losing that workforce and that qualified labour that are necessary for development, and for EU countries that are the worst hit by illegal immigration."
"in writing. - It is important that all aspects of the Cotonou Agreement are reviewed in the light of recent developments which are having a significant impact on ACP countries."
"But I would particularly like to add my voice to the concerns about regional integration, which is relevant not just to ACP countries but also to Latin American countries and particularly the Andean Community."
"The effect of some trade agreements (agreements which are, according to Commission officials, supposed to promote development) can be to jeopardise trade between countries in a given region and therefore run contrary to the stated development objective of promoting regional integration."
"The European Union must constantly re-evaluate its trade policies and the impact they have in this regard."
"Failure to do so, or to act appropriately, risks negative effects on long-term development."
"in writing. - I will vote for this report but I must make the point that certain organisations supported by the Commission, given the responsibility of delivering projects under EU-ACP partnerships, have been mired in corruption and have orchestrated a campaign of discrimination and victimisation against the members of staff who brought the said corruption to light."
"I refer, of course, to the organisation known as CDE, who, with Commission support, have dismissed all whistleblowers from office and have done little to put right failings in the governance and senior management of this organisation."
"When the OLAF investigation into CDE found that corruption had taken place and that the Commission had failed to exercise due diligence as members of the management board of the CDE at the time the fraud was taking place, one would have expected action and certainly protection for the whistleblowers concerned."
"Neither has happened, to the ultimate shame of the European Commission."
"Whilst I vote in favour today, I wonder whether there is an urgent need in future to examine in more detail what appears to be the inability of the EU side of these partnerships to exercise proper financial control."
"The Cotonou Agreement, dating from 2000, which regulates the cooperation between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, is revised every five years."
"Its objectives are the eradication of poverty and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the global economy, whilst adhering to the objective of sustainable development."
"This revision is taking place against the background of a global financial crisis, rapid climate change, strain on food and energy prices, and a discussion on land use and the sustainability of foreign investment."
"It is high time we strengthened parliamentary control of the country strategies and the European Development Fund (EDF) and strove for consistency in our trade, foreign and development policies."
"It is time we took a holistic approach to tackling climate change and put the maximum focus on renewable energy."
"It is time we combated illicit financial flow from developing countries and reformed European Investment Bank (EIB) policy in the direction of greater transparency with regard to tax havens."
"It is high time we recognised that land ownership and clean water are fundamental rights."
"It is time we admitted that fair access to natural resources really can help lift people out of poverty."
"The report emphasises this, and thus receives my support."
"I abstained on Mrs Joly's report on the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement."
"This report contains a large number of specific proposals on the renegotiation of this agreement - more commonly known as the Cotonou Agreement - which I support."
"For example, the need to take account of the situation of the world's poorest countries, in the light of their particular characteristics with regard to climate change, democracy and human rights, brain drain, corruption, and the particular features of their economy, particularly their agricultural economy."
"However, the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) adopted in plenary alter the report completely."
"A particular example is Amendment 3, which denies populations the right to define their own agrarian policies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (the 'Cotonou Agreement')."
"This agreement, which regulates the political, trade and development cooperation relations between the European Union and the 77 ACP countries, and which relates to the period 2000-2020, was already revised in 2005."
"In the provisions forming the subject of the second revision, it is rightly requested that ad hoc provisions relating to climate change be included, that the provisions relating to renewable energy be reviewed, that the provisions relating to rural development and food safety be enhanced, and that greater efforts be made to curb illegal financial flows and tax havens."
"I am certain that this revision will be able to strengthen the partnership relations between the EU and ACP countries and to ensure greater synergy and cooperation in view of the common objectives to be achieved."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"SWIFT (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council statement on SWIFT."
"Mr President, this is a Council statement on a programme which is an agreement between the European Union and the United States, as you know, for tracking the financing of terrorism and, therefore, with the aim of exchanging and passing on financial data, which I believe everyone agrees upon."
"This agreement has been in place for the last few months."
"It has worked well and gives continuity to the flow of information destined for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme."
"This agreement formally expires on 31 January."
"Therefore, during the previous term of the Swedish Presidency, the Council thought about the need to sign an agreement to enable the continuation of that Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme."
"For this reason, on 30 November 2009, the Council adopted a Decision on the signing of that agreement, the TFTP (Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme)."
"It is a provisional agreement."
"It is therefore valid for a short period, which, in principal, expires on 31 October 2010."
"Therefore, the provisional agreement which, as I have said, the Council agreed last year, will in any case will become invalid, unless this European Parliament takes a prior decision, in 2010."
"This is the present situation."
"There has been no communication between then and now on the part of the Commission about the content of that agreement, which is still not known by the European Parliament, but I can tell you now that it will be produced in the next week, on 25 January."
"It will be known to the European Parliament on 25 January."
"That agreement will arrive in this Chamber, properly translated and will be passed on in order for it to obtain the approval of the European Parliament."
"This has not been done before for the following reason, given to us by the Commission: the Commission has not finished the relevant translations and, therefore, the Council has not received them from the Commission."
"As I have just told you, these different language versions are still being finished, and as you know, the Council can only pass that document, that agreement, to Parliament, when the different language versions are available, which the Commission has in hand."
"This is what will be produced on 25 January."
"Furthermore, for the future and with a view to an agreement, not provisional, but definitive, the Commission intends to make recommendations in that regard for the formation of a long-term agreement, not an agreement which finishes in October of next year, such as the one we are talking about, but one for the long term."
"This long-term agreement must be negotiated and entered into according to new legal bases, as provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, in which the European Parliament has full involvement."
"The European Parliament already has full involvement in those agreements, and that is how it will be for the forthcoming agreement, upon which the Commission has not yet made any recommendations."
"To finish, I want to say that this is a matter of extreme importance."
"This is a procedure, a programme to combat terrorism."
"The Detroit incident has shown that there is present danger, that the threat persists and, therefore, the Member States must not allow that continuing flow of financial data to the TFTP to be abandoned."
"Judge Bruguière explained this in his in camera intervention filmed before this Parliament in November."
"He said that, in his opinion, several Member States had been able to benefit and take advantage of the information which was provided to the United States to uncover and avoid terrorist activities."
"This led the Council, during the previous Swedish Presidency, to make a provisional application for a new agreement, to avoid the expiry of the current one on 31 January and, therefore, the cancellation of any possible flow of information."
"It was the only option that the Council had to do so and, of course, yes, Parliament's position on obtaining information is understandable."
"This has not been produced, as I have told you, due to the European Commission's delay in producing the relevant translations."
"Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not."
"In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria."
"There are two sides to the coin."
"On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data - wherever this is stored - European data protection standards should apply."
"We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks."
"We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule."
"These are things that we regard as important."
"On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States."
"We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror."
"We do not want a situation in which individual states - if agreements expire - are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis."
"Careful consideration is also needed here."
"As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission once again not to play for time, but to send the text now so that we can deal with it."
"As Parliament, we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly."
"Then it will be up to the ministers - and just to make this very clear: the interior ministers - to convince Parliament that these methods that are now being proposed in this agreement really are necessary for the fight against terror."
"We are open to this process, but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive, in other words the ministers."
"Mr President, this is a serious law-making process that we are beginning now with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr López Garrido, if you are telling us that translations or the lack of translations in such a sensitive area is causing delays that we will just have to accept, then, with the greatest respect, I have to say that that is merely an excuse intended to protect yourself and pacify us here a little."
"However, we cannot take that seriously."
"I will simply take note of it now and then overlook it."
"The essence of the matter is something else entirely: the lack of involvement of the European Parliament."
"In the case of international agreements of such far-reaching importance, that is simply impermissible."
"We want Parliament to be genuinely involved from day one in the implementation of this agreement."
"Why is that?"
"Mr Buzek, the President of this House, worded it very precisely in his letter, saying that the SWIFT agreement provides for far-reaching infringements of citizens' fundamental freedoms, which are constitutionally guaranteed in most Member States and are also guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, if there are to be executive measures on the basis of such an agreement that provide for infringements of citizens' fundamental freedoms, the legal protection of citizens against such infringements must be absolutely guaranteed."
"That means that data protection must be guaranteed in every respect, the deletion of data after a certain, reasonable period must be guaranteed and appeal facilities must be precisely set out for citizens in the event of the violation of their fundamental rights."
"One of the constituent elements of the principle of the rule of law is that citizens are able to protect themselves against arbitrary treatment on the part of the State."
"The European Union cannot invalidate this legal tradition, which is enshrined in the systems of 27 States, by referring to unavailable translations."
"If we are serious about wanting to develop the rule of law at European level, we must also transfer to the European level the model of the necessity of intervention on the grounds of security but also the legitimate protection of citizens."
"The Council must therefore explain to us where the added value of the SWIFT agreement is if it is now - as the Council desires - provisionally to enter into force."
"I am not going to talk about the data breaches from the numerous security services in the United States."
"Someone stuffs some explosives into their underwear and flies over the Atlantic."
"That is what the intensive security work carried out by the American secret services has so far achieved."
"That cannot be what it is dependent on, though."
"I am wondering why we have to apply this fast-tracked procedure when there has been an agreement in place between the EU and the United States since 1 February on provisional legal assistance, Article 4 of which describes precisely how bank data is to be passed on where there are justified grounds for suspicion."
"This means that the entry into force of the SWIFT agreement would not provide any added value in terms of protection."
"Therefore, this undue haste, - or a 'pig's gallop', as we would call it in German - this pressure to speed things up, is incomprehensible and so our unanimous request to the Council must be put very precisely: send us the relevant documents!"
"We will debate this matter and conclude the parliamentary procedure with the necessary speed because we want security, but not only for the security bodies; we want security for the citizens who are supposed to be protected by these security bodies, too."
"I believe that is the purpose of this agreement, but in that case, we also want it to be enacted as an appropriate law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us start with the good news: the Spanish Presidency has announced that the document is due to be submitted on Monday 25 January, in other words, next Monday - I have made a note."
"This therefore means that we now have one week to discuss it in Parliament; that is the reality."
"My request, Mr President - I have already announced this, and I hope that I will have the support of the other groups - is that a decision be taken, at the Conference of Presidents, to hold both a committee meeting and a part-session to examine this interim agreement, because it would be pointless to allow it to enter into force on 1 February without Parliament having discussed it first."
"There are therefore two options, Mr Zapatero: yes or no."
"I can tell you that obtaining a 'yes' will depend on a range of conditions; it is important to know that, and we must have an answer on this before 25 January."
"No response to the conditions laid down by Parliament has been received."
"These conditions are as follows: firstly, that Parliament be kept fully informed and receive all the necessary information; secondly, that Parliament be involved in the negotiations on the definitive agreement; and, thirdly, there are the specific conditions, nine in total, set out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in its resolution - which has been approved by Parliament - relating to the actual content of the agreement."
"Our request to you is very simple: you must not only send us the interim agreement on 25 January; you must also provide your response to Parliament's three requests."
"If your response to our three requests is positive, our approval of the agreement might then be a possibility."
"If it is not positive, I think that the vote is likely to be negative - that is the opinion of my group, in any case."
"I have to point out that a negative vote will mean that the interim agreement will not enter into force on 1 February."
"This is the current situation, and thus tomorrow, I will, in any case, ask the Conference of Presidents both to convene an appropriate committee on the issue and to hold a part-session to discuss this interim agreement."
"Mr President, all of Parliament's frustration is now raining down on the Spanish Presidency, which has only just taken up office."
"Accept it on behalf of the Council as a whole, but I still consider you, yourselves, to be involved in this."
"I am annoyed that there are no representatives of the Commission in seats 21 and 22 because, if I understand it correctly, the Commission would have had a duty to expedite this whole matter once Parliament had been asked to set the approval procedure in motion."
"However, the Commission is avoiding its responsibilities and has stayed away from the debate."
"I do not want to repeat what my fellow Members have said, but I would like to say that I think it would be extremely dangerous for the Council to have this provisional SWIFT agreement enter into force without Parliament having first voted on what you intend to present to us."
"I consider the procedure - if you continue to push this through by 1 February at breakneck speed, or at a pig's gallop, as Mr Schulz quite rightly described the whole procedure - not only to be a provocation of Parliament, but also a violation of the treaties, a violation of the Treaty of Lisbon, after it has only just entered into force, and that is irresponsible."
"In matters of urgency, you have every possibility of exchanging vital information by means of bilateral legal agreements with the US and with any other country in the world with whom such agreements exist. So there is no hurry."
"I would like to emphasise once again that the citizens of the EU are watching with interest to see how we respond to the highly acclaimed Treaty of Lisbon."
"If we do not, at this point, ensure parliamentary control, if we accept this breach of national data protection laws and contravene the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was so often cited in the debate about the Treaty of Lisbon, it will, I believe, be a kind of kamikaze action and completely unjustifiable."
"However, Mr López Garrido, you share the responsibility for this with the Commission."
"I would like to ask you one more thing."
"I have just been informed by text message that some language versions of the SWIFT agreement have already been published."
"Please could you tell us which language versions have been published in the Official Journal, when this was done and why these versions have not yet been made available to Parliament."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of EU citizens."
"SWIFT has been a valuable tool in achieving this."
"Luckily, having met with US Government officials, particularly Mr David Cohen, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the US Treasury Department, recently in Washington, I was reassured by the multi-layered control systems and safeguards and independent oversight which I hope will lead to the implementation of this new agreement being beyond reproach."
"Where I must express grave concern, as others have done, is in the Council's substandard consultation with Parliament, and alleged Commission delays."
"It is essential that Parliament and the elected representatives of this House are frequently and properly informed, and parliamentary consent must not be a retrospective tool."
"For the Council to treat it as such undermines the values and democratic principles that lie at the heart of this Chamber and this Parliament."
"I do hope that the Council, and indeed the Presidency, will take careful note of these remarks."
"Mr President, this House has been treated in an insulting and almost humiliating way throughout this whole process."
"To tell us that we have to wait for the language versions is unacceptable when we know that there are several versions circulating in the press, following leaks of information."
"Nevertheless, we were presented with an outline of the agreement on a Friday in Brussels, when the MEPs had gone to Strasbourg."
"Only one MEP was present in Brussels. That MEP happened to be me."
"The repeated references to the Bruguière Report, a secret report, are also unacceptable."
"This is hardly convincing, as anyone who has read the Bruguière Report knows that it contains almost no empirical data."
"It is unacceptable to say that this is a provisional report, when the data collected over the next nine months will be in the hands of the US administration within five years, and it might be a Sarah Palin administration, rather than the Obama administration."
"How can a European citizen feel safe?"
"You clearly give us no alternative but to reject this agreement, and you are not making our life any easier."
"In rejecting it, however, we are doing the Commission a favour, as there are two new commissioners, Mrs Malmström and Mrs Reding, who we know will certainly be able to negotiate the best possible agreement from scratch, and we are sure that they are willing to do so."
"(DE) Mr President, very many measures have been adopted under the guise of combating terrorism in recent years, including by the Council."
"However, very many of these measures are not reasonably proportionate to the actual threat posed by terrorism."
"On the contrary, they have resulted in unacceptable restrictions of citizens rights."
"The systematic exchange of data, unrelated to any grounds for suspicion, provided for in the SWIFT agreement is clearly no exception to this."
"Even the German Federal Criminal Police Office, which is not really known as a data protection group, had to admit the disproportionate nature of this measure."
"We must put a stop to these permanent restrictions of citizens' rights and we must not approve the provisional agreement."
"With regard to the Council's methods, I would once again like to say quite clearly that the US examined and stored the data of SWIFT users without any form of restriction at all."
"However, the Council did not sanction this procedure, it legalised it!"
"I would, of course, also like to urge the Council to pass on all of the information relating to this matter to the European Parliament."
"There was a particular intervention, I think it was Mrs Harms, referring to the possible publication of one of the language versions."
"Obviously, I do not have that information."
"I will check it out and let you know the situation in writing."
"What I have told you is that on 25 January, the agreement which will come into force provisionally on 1 February will be in the hands of the European Parliament."
"In accordance with European law, in accordance with Article 218 of the Treaty of Lisbon and in accordance with the Vienna Convention, signed agreements can provisionally come into force."
"Therefore, it is valid."
"For the European Union and, of course, for the Council, it is important that this agreement remains in force."
"It is important that these agreements on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme remain in force."
"We feel that it is a positive step, that it serves the struggle against terrorism, and that it involves collaboration with the United States, which is a trustworthy country, a partner country, a neighbour, which has the same purpose as ourselves: the fight against terrorism."
"This has nothing to do with the delay in receiving the language versions, it is definitely not an excuse, Mr Schulz."
"It is not a matter of gaining time, Mr Weber."
"As you know, a few weeks ago, or months even, the Swedish Presidency, the Council, suggested sending this version in a single language to Parliament, from the Council, and the Commission realised that this was not possible, that it had to be the actual Commission which would produce the language versions and send them all on."
"The Council had good intentions on the part of the Swedish Presidency, but it was not possible either legally or technically."
"That is the reason it has arrived now."
"I understand that the European Parliament would have liked to have this version earlier."
"I agree absolutely."
"If I had been an MEP, I would think exactly the same and would have wanted to have these versions earlier."
"It did not happen that way for the reason I told you."
"It has nothing to do with gaining time, or hiding anything, nor is it an excuse."
"Absolutely not."
"I think this is an agreement where the European Parliament will have the full capacity to take part, because the Lisbon Treaty has come into force and we have - I think a great majority of us - adopted that treaty, and that will give Parliament the capacity to take part in a sovereign way."
"Parliament will be able to, if it wishes, cut short the validity of this provisional agreement."
"Parliament will take part in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term agreement."
"The EP, together with the Council, of course, will have all the authority to influence the SWIFT Agreement which we believe is very important, which deserves to be debated in this Parliament, thoroughly, seriously and without haste or pressure, to use an expression that you, yourselves, have already used."
"What is more, we are absolutely agreed, Mr Verhofstadt and other speakers, that here it is necessary to respect people's fundamental rights, the right to privacy and European legislation on data protection."
"Moreover, now we have another instrument to guarantee these rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has just come into force because it is linked to the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fully in force."
"One of the rights that it guarantees is the right to privacy and data protection."
"Therefore, we have all the conditions to make a good agreement."
"As for Mr Verhofstadt's proposal to send a letter or to immediately reach a Council position on the conditions established by Parliament, I believe that the best thing is that when Parliament has that document, we will be at your disposal to debate it in every sense, with all those conditions and, therefore, to come to a serious, rigorous and unpressured agreement in this respect."
"Yes, of course, for the moment, we think it is vital to get this provisional agreement in force and, in any case, Parliament will have all the authority accorded it by the Treaty of Lisbon to ultimately decide whether or not the agreement should go ahead."
"This will depend on you."
"It will depend on Parliament as a whole."
"The debate is closed."
"I said earlier that it is not possible to give the floor to others."
"If there is a request on a point of order, I can give the floor."
"Please proceed."
"Mr President, I would just like to understand one thing: if only one or a few language versions are available, then I would like to know the language skills of the Members of the Commission and the Council who signed the agreement and who decided on it on 30 November - so it must be available."
"That was not a point of order, but we allowed it because Mrs in 't Veld was so polite in her request to take the floor."
"Please proceed, Minister."
"I repeat what I said."
"I will check the information given to me by Mrs Harms, I think it was, regarding the document."
"I am not sure because I do not have it with me, of course, and I will let her know what happened on this matter."
"In any case, I repeat, on 25 January, you will have the agreement and we will be able to discuss it as much as you like."
"The Spanish Presidency, the government and the Council are at your disposal to talk for as long as you like, in depth, about this agreement whose future entry into force will depend on the European Parliament."
"One exception soon becomes many, and I cannot deny Mr Schulz the floor."
"Please proceed, Mr Schulz."
"(DE) Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again."
"It is a rare event in my life, but we are not at a fun fair here."
"Mr López Garrido, the agreement was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 13 January."
"You are not responsible for that, but if you now say to us 'I need first to find out which language versions are available' then I have to say again that this is not a recreational event for the mutual enjoyment of MEPs and ministers."
"This is a legislative chamber in which serious work is required!"
"I would now like to say something to you - not to the Spanish Presidency, but to the Council - and that is that the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters shows that it has no regard for Parliament whatsoever."
"The time has now come for us to say to the Council that these little games are finished."
"There is a serious legislative procedure - in Europe, this, of course, involves all documents and all dossiers being available in all languages at the start of the procedure and does not mean that we have to go in search of the documents with a divining rod after the procedure has supposedly finished."
"This is not a sound procedure."
"I ask you now to tell us which language versions were available when the agreement was published in the Official Journal on 13 January."
"That is something that I am now formally requesting to know on behalf of our group."
"Please, ladies and gentlemen, after Mr Schulz has spoken, we will give the floor to the Minister for the final response and we will close the debate."
"We are going to inform Parliament on everything it has requested: on the language versions, on which ones are available and so on."
"I do not believe that the Council has treated the European Parliament in a humiliating manner, nor has it in any way denied Parliament information."
"I am referring to the Swedish Presidency which, at the time, did what it could in order to be able to submit the agreement, but that was not legally possible because some of the language versions had still not been translated."
"Now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, the European Parliament will be able to discuss this matter fully, and the Council is ready to provide Parliament with all the information it requires and to establish a dialogue on the matter."
"I do not believe that this constitutes treating the European Parliament badly and, therefore, I do not share the sentiments expressed by Mr Schulz on the issue."
"The facts will show this."
"A full text will be made available to the European Parliament and Parliament will be able to debate it with the Council for as long and in as much depth as it likes, and the European Parliament will have the final say on the matter."
"It is as simple as that."
"Therefore, I believe there is no need to be concerned that the Council is withholding information on any subject whatsoever."
"The Council believes wholly in the need to respect the Union's fundamental rights and it believes wholly in the need to respect Parliament, which is the representative of the people of Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"I will not give the floor to anyone else on this matter."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"What is being referred to as the SWIFT agreement (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) governs the passing on of data from the global bank network."
"On a daily basis, 8 000 monetary institutions from 200 countries communicate with each other via the channels of the society, which is based in Belgium, with data centres in the Netherlands and the US."
"According to the Commission, requests for data can only relate to international transfers and use of the service is strictly limited to terrorism investigations by the secret services."
"However, both high-ranking politicians and criminal experts doubt that, in the US, the data would be used solely for combating terrorist activities."
"Data abuse, violations of civil rights and the passing on of data to third parties are all very real dangers that could result from the SWIFT agreement."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we absolutely must not allow the entry into force of this agreement and the associated data transfer to the US, and certainly not without the approval of the European Parliament."
"Provisional entry into force of the agreement pending the debate in the European Parliament in February would constitute a huge violation of the fundamental principle of democracy."
"Outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I stand in Parliament today in order to share with you my views on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit and the challenges that arise from it, both for the European Union and for the rotating Presidency that Spain holds for the first half of 2010."
"The European Union Environment Ministers discussed these matters at length last weekend."
"I should point out that we broadly agree on our desire to continue moving forward, on three issues in particular: building on the results of the summit, with a view to making them operational as soon as possible; strengthening their elements within the United Nations; and working to fulfil our goals to reduce overall emissions."
"We have shared goals and strategies."
"As a result, our most immediate tasks will be to complete the process of formally announcing our commitment; to consolidate an action framework comparable to that of other industrialised and emerging nations; and to make use of all the tools we have available, both within the European Union and in our relationships with third countries."
"The December summit - an extremely complicated conference characterised by arduous discussions on procedure - was brought to a conclusion in the so-called Copenhagen Accord."
"A large number of Heads of State or Government and leaders of regional groups were personally involved in producing the document that was adopted, which represents the will of countries whose emissions total more than 80% of those produced globally."
"Participants included all the industrialised countries, major emerging economies, and a significant number of especially vulnerable countries."
"This should also help us to respond to the many doubts that continue to clog up the formal process which should lead us towards legally binding solutions, within the United Nations framework and preferably in Mexico."
"With regard to the content of the Accord, I think it is important to stress that we have clear support for not allowing the temperature to rise by more than two degrees centigrade. This is surely one of its strongest elements with the greatest potential for results: the commitment of all industrialised countries to establish a target for reduction that can be applied right across their economies."
"Emerging nations, for their part, will take concrete, verifiable action that will allow them to make a substantial reduction in their emissions growth: financing based on solidarity and aimed at supporting immediate and medium-term action in the fight against climate change; elements intended to steer new models of governance; and mechanisms that foster technological development and a reduction in emissions caused by deforestation."
"The Copenhagen Summit has shown that we are moving within a new international context, one that requires improvements if we want to provide solutions to global problems."
"The decision-making rules in place need to be changed so that they can adapt properly to these new times and necessities."
"We do have the tools we need in order to act: a legislative package already in place at Community level; the very highest commitment to furthering a reduction in emissions, international solidarity and technological innovation and cooperation; and the correct institutional structure within the Union, which we must use intelligently, taking full advantage of its complementarity."
"We will have to combine the leadership of the Environment Council when negotiating and planning climate change policies with greater capacity for external action."
"Furthermore, we should link the environmental task ahead with our experts' opinions on policies relating to the economy and innovation; we should also improve consistency between our climate goals and our model of development and well-being."
"All of this must be done without losing sight of the need - both inside and outside the European Union - to consolidate the role of public opinion and of legislators who are committed to investing in a better future and to protecting public interests."
"Let us bring to bear our collective European experience."
"Firstly, we have to push for a proper response before 31 January."
"The Copenhagen Accord, by bringing together all those who have to reduce their emissions, thus enables a comparison of efforts to be made, a comparison that the European Union has demanded; yet we are still not sure how strong other countries' commitments really are."
"If they prove to be insufficient, we must continue working to further our collective reductions."
"We will also have to bring about conditions which allow those elements that make up the accord to be applied swiftly."
"It is vital for the European Union and its Member States to be at the forefront of those countries that keep their promises."
"For this reason, we will need to carry out the transfer of funds as soon as possible, planned for the period 2010-2012."
"We want to develop a financial framework that can sustain our solidarity commitments with third countries in the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund and, at the same time, foster improvements in accounting rules and our response in terms of both reductions in emissions caused by deforestation and technological cooperation."
"The following elements need to be added to this: our own policies, aimed at fulfilling our emissions reduction targets at both national and Community level; the boost provided by innovation and intelligent energy use; the incorporation of adaptation measures for sectoral policies; and consistent external action."
"We want to work closely with the Commission and Parliament on all of this, seeking to establish the world region that stands at the forefront of the fight against climate change, that has the lowest carbon emissions, that is the best prepared to face the challenges presented by climate change and is the most efficient at transforming this into a powerful force for innovation and competitiveness."
"Our policy on climate change is one of the key identifying characteristics of the European model."
"We have been pioneers when integrating that principle into our proposals for a fairer and more sustainable development, not only economic, but also social and environmental, knowing that we are strengthening international security in the process."
"This fact has enabled major players, such as China and the United States, to come together at the same negotiating table and to identify and share decisive elements for cooperation."
"The European Union, a staunch defender of the United Nations' role in resolving global issues, will also have work to do in other areas, both bilateral and multilateral, formal and informal, helping everyone to correctly identify opportunities, listening to our partners, and working on consolidating sectoral responses that are consistent with what is needed to fight climate change."
"We must take full advantage of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and the entry into force of the new institutions, systematically incorporating the main messages on the fight against climate change into our relations with third countries."
"This is no small task we are facing."
"The government of Spain is aware of the magnitude of the challenge and wishes to show here that it is committed to making as much progress as possible on those elements that may facilitate an ambitious, binding agreement in Mexico."
"We cannot waste the political opportunity that was created in Copenhagen, nor lower our expectations or those of the international community."
"Our credibility is at stake."
"We have to stand our ground."
"The new, greater powers of the European Parliament, which bring it even closer to the citizens, will enable closer, more fruitful cooperation."
"I want to conclude my speech by congratulating everyone on that point and reminding you all that, now more than ever, we need your hard work and support over the vital six-month period that lies ahead."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you on behalf of the Commission for the chance to discuss the outcome of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the follow-up to the Copenhagen Accord."
"My colleague, Stavros Dimas, has asked me to apologise on his behalf for not being able to be here himself because he is ill, which is particularly regrettable as this would probably have been his last plenary appearance."
"I volunteered to substitute for Stavros in this very important debate."
"I want to express our appreciation for the active and supportive role the European Parliament played before the conference and at the conference itself."
"The contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful."
"In particular, you have played a crucial role in order to enhance our outreach with key players in other countries and other regions."
"I believe we share the view that the result of Copenhagen falls badly short of our goal of an ambitious and legally binding agreement, which would be necessary to limit climate change to below 2° C. This is extremely disappointing for all of us who have fought for years and years for concrete policy decisions to reverse climate change."
"The reasons for the failure were many and I will come back to them in a moment."
"Still, one may also conclude that the Accord is better than no outcome at all, which would have been the worst-case scenario."
"On the one hand - to find something positive - the Copenhagen Accord at least recognises the need to limit climate change to below 2° C. It also invites the developed countries to list economy-wide emission targets by 31 January 2010 and calls for the developing countries to list mitigation actions by the same date."
"Furthermore, the Accord sets the basis for a rather substantial financial package of USD 30 billion for the coming three years and recognises the need for USD 100 billion annually by 2020."
"On the other hand, the Accord has serious weaknesses."
"It contains no reference to mid-term or long-term mitigation targets."
"The reduction pledges announced so far are not sufficient to stay within the target of 2° C. There is unfortunately, in my view, little cause for optimism that we will see improved offers by 31 January - rather the opposite."
"Last, but certainly not least, the Accord is not legally binding and, perhaps even more worrying, it does not provide for the conclusion of a legally binding agreement this year, which was one of our key goals."
"Looking ahead, the next step will be to ensure that this Accord will at least become operational and will pave the way for a new climate treaty, which must be agreed on urgently in the course of this year."
"As a very first step, it will be crucial to ensure that all key parties now endorse the Accord and notify their targets or actions by 31 January."
"Adequate financing also needs to be provided."
"In this respect, we need to explore ways of setting up a Copenhagen Green Climate Fund."
"We must also strengthen alliances with countries and regions who share our vision of a successful outcome in the international climate negotiations."
"To conclude, we have huge challenges before us to ensure unity at the European level, to engage strategically with key external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate action, but there are many lessons to be learned from COP 15."
"One striking lesson certainly is that we must learn to speak with one voice."
"In Copenhagen, China, India, the United States and other major powers each spoke with one voice, while Europe spoke with many different voices."
"The same goes for global economic governance and international security."
"We are indeed at a crossroads today."
"Either we take determined and united action for Europe's ecological, economic and political revival, or we risk economic stagnation and political irrelevance."
"Let us take Copenhagen as an alarming warning of that scenario."
"We must do better than that and we can do."
"Only by standing united can we succeed, and I look forward to working with you to achieve this objective."
"Mr President, first of all, may I ask you to give our regards to Commissioner Dimas and convey the thanks of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for his efforts over recent years."
"Naturally, we, too, are disappointed by the results of the climate-change summit, but it is important not to forget that historic steps have indeed been taken with regard to certain elements, for example climate financing, deforestation and the two-degree target; even though this is imperfect, as you rightly pointed out."
"Naturally, we would have preferred something much more ambitious - see our resolution - but these are initial steps on which we must now build."
"It is extremely important that we carry out an in-depth analysis of Europe's contribution to this summit, as Europe was absent at the crucial time."
"The summit may have been well prepared by Europe from a content and technical point of view, but politically speaking it was a disaster."
"Europe's political performance was simply poor."
"You are right in saying that Europe must speak with one voice, but that is easier said than done."
"We really must now make use of the opportunities offered by the new Treaty of Lisbon, too."
"Two new women will - we hope - soon be in the front line: Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Ashton."
"They must bring in the rest of the world, paving the road to Mexico with strong climate diplomacy."
"Mr President, the PPE Group sees it as a given that we must retain the 30% target expressed in our November resolution, and must combine this target with not only European but also global ambition."
"We must revise our strategy, as it was not endorsed; a number of the key players did not endorse a global target."
"We must revise our strategy, but we must also retain our ambition."
"The Copenhagen Summit was a failure."
"The gap between the world's richer and poorer countries has increased, and neither the Swedish Presidency nor the Danish Prime Minister was able to prevent or avoid that."
"As a fellow Member said recently, Europe was absent."
"After this disappointment, it is important to regain the initiative."
"Naturally, this cannot be achieved by refusing to acknowledge that the Copenhagen conference was a failure - as Mrs Hedegaard, the candidate Commissioner for Climate Action, has done."
"That only increases the risk of the mistakes being repeated."
"How will the Spanish Presidency and the Commission pave the way for a binding climate agreement in Mexico?"
"Will you secure financing for the new climate initiatives in developing countries so that it is not just a repackaging of aid funding that is already intended for fighting poverty, among other things?"
"Will you propose that our own emissions reductions are stepped up from 20 to 30 per cent?"
"That would be regaining the initiative."
"Will you eradicate the developing countries' distrust by noting the value of the Kyoto agreement as a basis for continued work on a global climate agreement?"
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the circumstances which led to 192 Heads of State or Government going to Copenhagen have not changed, and the failure of Copenhagen clearly must not be a reason to lower our ambitions."
"However, we definitely need to change our strategy - we need a new strategy."
"This strategy must be firm, dynamic and innovative."
"First of all, it must be firm because it is essential that we not only maintain our targets but increase them, going as far as a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"We must accelerate our industrial switchover to a green economy based on energy efficiency, clean and efficient processes, renewable energies, and new syntheses between information and environmental technologies, because the battle that started in Copenhagen is also that of industry and the industrial leaders of the 21st century."
"We have to have a dynamic strategy without in any way delegitimising the UN process."
"We must take initiatives with regard to the United States and China in order to be able to establish a potential basis for an agreement for Mexico."
"We must not allow the G2 we saw in operation become a reality but rather, put ourselves at the heart of this process; this will only be possible if we speak with one voice."
"We must be innovative: innovative on the carbon markets by imposing an upper price limit, and innovative in terms of financing methods."
"Personally speaking, and without committing my group, I think the issue of a carbon tax at our borders will have to be addressed."
"We must then restore confidence with regard to Africa by increasing funding, but not by recycling official aid and renaming it 'carbon' funds."
"The bottom line is that we have to make a considerable effort so that we can maintain our resolve to be the world leaders on climate change."
"Mr President, the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit is a disappointment, for the reasons already stated."
"For the first time, the United Nations document mentions a two degree warming limit, but the emission limits stated by various countries at Copenhagen are the equivalent of more than a three degree rise in global warming."
"The last time it was three degrees warmer than now, the surface of the sea was 10 metres higher."
"We have to acknowledge honestly that the EU did not show the sort of leadership it proclaims."
"The most important way for us to lead would have been, and still is, to aim for a more stringent emission reduction target of at least 30%."
"Our real target should be a reduction of 40%, if we were to heed the message of the climate scientists, as we quite rightly should."
"If we now stop short at a 20% reduction in emissions, it will mean that the EU has not meant anything by declaring the two degree warming limit that it has done for more than ten years now."
"According to reports commissioned by a large number of governments, including the Dutch Government, a 20% reduction in emissions is a long way from the world's most ambitious target."
"In the light of the information we have now, a 30% reduction target will cost less than what was estimated to be the cost of cutting emissions by 20% two years ago."
"Of course, at Copenhagen there were countries that wanted to torpedo the talks."
"If the EU had led, it would have made this difficult for them."
"This time, the EU made it easy for them by blocking the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period, which is extremely important for the developing countries."
"It would be constructive to say that we are prepared for Kyoto's second period on certain conditions, and it would be constructive to undertake to support climate action on the part of the economically less developed countries without recycling development cooperation money under a new heading."
"From this meagre outcome, we now need to move on towards a proper climate agreement."
"It can only be internationally legitimate if negotiated via the United Nations."
"We also need a new form of climate diplomacy."
"It is not enough that our experts know their way through the technical jungle."
"We need patient diplomatic efforts to overcome the stumbling blocks and also to make the UN negotiating process a more viable one, so that, for example, it adopts rules on voting."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I hope that I am proved to be wrong, but it looks to me increasingly unlikely that the talks begun and continued at Copenhagen will, in fact, lead to a legally binding treaty committing all of the major emitters in the world to large emission cuts."
"In those circumstances, I believe it would be very foolish for those of us in the EU debating these matters to agree to even further emissions reductions."
"A figure of 30% has been mentioned."
"Mrs Hassi just mentioned 40%."
"In the absence of a worldwide agreement, I think we would be crazy to agree to further reductions because what we will do is run the risk of saddling our consumers with some of the highest energy bills in the developed world, making European heavy industry and large energy consumers particularly uncompetitive in a worldwide environment."
"Already we have seen a lot of industry relocating to outside the EU, simply, of course, transferring emissions from the EU to China, India and elsewhere."
"This is a crazy economic policy because it has no net benefit for the environment whatsoever."
"In fact, in some respects, it has a net deleterious effect on the environment as those goods are simply re-imported back into the EU, after all."
"What we need is a comprehensive worldwide agreement."
"I am fully in favour of that."
"I hope we will work towards achieving it, but in the absence of one, we should be very wary of further unilateral cuts in Europe."
"Mr President, an ambitious, legally-binding treaty is needed urgently."
"According to the most up-to-date scientific information, the EU must commit to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2020 and to an 80-95% reduction by 2050, and this kind of pledge cannot be made by depending on other people's actions."
"Everybody must know what real reductions in emissions will be put in place and we must know that the necessary funding will be provided to developing countries to enable them to combat climate change and its consequences."
"Clarity is needed."
"We all need clarity regarding who exactly will provide this funding, how much each developed country will provide, and how and when it will be provided."
"The lack of political will demonstrated in Copenhagen cannot be repeated."
"And I also wish Commissioner Dimas every success."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, there was a lot of talk about so-called climate refugees in connection with COP 15."
"People have always fled from natural disasters, poor harvests, drought, floods and famine."
"The fact is that climate change and its direct impact on people and the environment are problems that we have no choice but to deal with."
"However, I cannot help asking whether we are going the right way about it."
"I agree that we need to be more aware of how we use resources in our daily lives and to research new technologies."
"We must not forget, however, that in fact, we already have ways of alleviating problems that suddenly arise."
"In connection with COP 15, for example, there was mention of the Cook Islands - an island group in the Pacific."
"The problem these islands face is that they are under threat from rising water levels."
"A sea wall could protect the islands, and in fact, a sea wall is a perfectly manageable investment - just not for a poor island group."
"While we in the West discuss wind power, electric cars, solar energy, biofuels and new ways of sorting waste in the suburbs of Europe, many islands are gradually disappearing."
"I would therefore ask whether the Western world should be investing billions in climate technology - the effect of which is highly questionable - while millions of people could be helped using already known, low-cost measures."
"Rather than quarrelling over statistics, evidence and research, now is the time we need to be dealing with the impact of climate change at a global level by means of real action."
"Mr President, after Copenhagen, let us reassess the whole global warming story."
"At Copenhagen, we had the irony of not just 'Climategate II', but also the onset of one of the harshest winters in decades."
"Since then, we have seen the debunking of the Potsdam sea-level scare; the Goddard Institute has been caught fiddling the temperature records; the vanishing Himalayan glaciers have been exposed as a fantasy;"
"Mr Pachauri has emerged as a climate change profiteer."
"The world is cooling."
"Global warming is a fraud."
"This is not a victimless crime."
"Carbon taxes push up fuel prices, killing our old folk as we speak."
"The billions wasted researching this non-existent problem are billions that cannot be spent defeating real scourges such as Alzheimer's, or ending real environmental disasters such as deforestation."
"Carbon credit trading makes billions for City sharks at the expense of families in poverty."
"The loss of agricultural land to biofuels has already doubled world food prices, so millions are starving while greedy corporations make even fatter profits."
"Those pushing the unscientific nonsense of man-made climate change - Shell, Monsanto, the international banks, Bilderberg one-worlders, carbon billionaires and their useful idiot allies on the left - are running the biggest fraud in human history."
"They must and will be called to account, as should their collaborators in places such as this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Copenhagen, and following the conference, much has been said about amendments to UN regulations."
"I suggest that we change the regulations in this House, so that those people in marginal groups, like Mr Griffin, do not speak at the beginning but right at the end, which is their rightful place in this political spectrum, at least in the first round."
"Ladies and gentlemen, of course, Copenhagen was disappointing."
"Many of our demands and the expectations of citizens were definitely not met."
"I would like to add one thing to what has already been said."
"We want an international agreement for emissions from aviation and maritime transport."
"Unfortunately, Copenhagen brought absolutely no progress on this matter."
"It was not even mentioned in the Copenhagen climate agreement."
"That is a disappointing outcome, particularly as we know that every year that we lose will, of course, result in us having to raise our efforts even further."
"The later we start, the bolder and stronger our efforts will need to be, and with every passing year it will, of course, become more difficult."
"It is like a serious illness, the earlier it is treated, the milder the treatment needs to be."
"That is why it is a disappointment."
"Nevertheless, we should not look at it from a negative, one-sided viewpoint."
"This morning, I was asked whether the subject of climate change was now politically dead in the water."
"It is not."
"It must continue and that is also what the citizens expect from us."
"We should look for the positive things that actually happened in Copenhagen."
"I will take two small examples, namely the undertaking by two developing countries, the Maldives and Costa Rica, to become climate-neutral in the next ten years."
"The whole world - Europe and the rest of the world - can follow their lead."
"These are small States, but if we look at a large State like Brazil, for example, what is happening there is also remarkable."
"Therefore, we should analyse our mistakes and not be so arrogant as simply to carry on as before."
"However, we should not go round in sackcloth and ashes, either, but join with those in the world who want to make progress in protecting the climate."
"The game must no longer be industrialised countries against developing countries, but those countries who have understood what it is all about against the rest of the world, where the latter group, it is to be hoped, will increasingly shrink in size."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, last week I attended the Informal Environment Council meeting in Seville."
"It was the first Council configuration under the Spanish Presidency."
"You were, of course, unable to attend due to an unfortunate family matter, but your Secretary of State, Teresa Ribera, did a splendid job of representing you."
"Throughout the meeting, which was extremely well organised, the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to the matter was evident."
"That is all well and good, but the result of this Council meeting was not very satisfactory."
"The Council of Ministers was divided, with a complete lack of direction."
"There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now."
"That is not a good sign."
"It is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 Member States."
"In my opinion, we need to do three things in the European Union following Copenhagen."
"The first is that we must regain the leading role in global climate protection."
"Secondly, we need to show credibility in the commitments that we have made and, thirdly, we urgently need to gain new partners before we get to Mexico."
"With regard to regaining the leading role, I agree with everyone here who said that we should continue to state our promise to reduce carbon emissions by 30%."
"I would like to see us specify this 30% target to the UN Secretariat in Bonn on 31 January, not the old 20% target."
"If we make ourselves dependent on comparable efforts by others, it will take forever and Mexico will also come to nothing."
"In terms of showing credibility, the EUR 7.2 billion must actually be realised before Mexico."
"The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress."
"Finally, with regard to gaining partners, I hope that we will develop climate protection diplomacy and, with the help of the African Union in particular, that we will also find sufficient partners, including in Latin America and Asia, for a global agreement in Mexico."
"Mr President, and fellow collaborators, we need to move on from Copenhagen."
"The truth is we do not know the way."
"We are stumbling around in the dark."
"I think we just simply have to explore every opportunity and hope that one or more of them will take us forward."
"But I am sure we have to try to maintain our ambitions and keep our leadership, and on this point there is a crucial decision coming up within the next fortnight and I want to know what the Presidency is going to do to get it right."
"Forty per cent of our emissions come from the fossil fuels burnt in our power stations."
"That is why the development of carbon capture and storage technology is recognised as so important."
"That is why the Council three years ago agreed that we should try and build up to 12 demonstration projects by 2015."
"Now, we agreed a year ago a method of financing those projects: to use 300 million in allowances from the emissions trading scheme."
"It took three months for that idea to come from Parliament, to get approval by the Council to unlock the door, but 12 months later, we still have not agreed how to choose the projects or use the money."
"The Commission has finally put forward a draft decision."
"It proposes only eight CCS projects, and the timetable it recommends means that it will be impossible for them all to be built by 2015."
"Commissioner Rehn has got the hot seat, then;"
"I hope someone will pass him a note between now and the end of the debate so he can explain the lack of ambition in this document."
"But it must be agreed: however inadequate, we have got to move forward."
"It will be debated at a meeting of the Council's Climate Change Committee on 2 February, and there is opposition from some Member States who oppose the Commission having the final say over the selection of projects and the use and distribution of the money."
"Now this meeting will be the first opportunity since Copenhagen for the European Union to demonstrate whether it is going forward and taking practical steps or going to slip backwards."
"It is a crucial test both for the Commission and the Presidency."
"So my question to the Minister is: Is the Presidency going to ensure that we get agreement at that meeting, or are you going to drop the ball?"
"(NL) Mr President, let us be quite clear: Copenhagen was a failure."
"Indeed, there were three real losers from the summit: the United Nations, the European Union and the climate."
"It is of the utmost importance, then, to turn these three losers into victors in 2010 on the way to Mexico."
"To achieve this, three things must happen."
"The first is that the EU must really speak with one voice, as Commissioner Rehn has already said, but - and I should appreciate a specific answer to this - who is it to be?"
"Who will speak on Europe's behalf in Mexico?"
"Secondly, with regard to the United Nations, Europe must prove its leadership in the negotiations, too, which means no longer looking only to the United States and China, and instead looking mainly to the countries sharing our wish for action on the climate, such as the African Union, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa."
"We should be widening the group of countries with whom we wish to conclude an agreement."
"Thirdly, the climate."
"It is true that we agreed on two degrees, but this figure also means something."
"The science says that two degrees means rich countries must reduce their CO2 emissions by 40%."
"Therefore, the EU must now promise 30%."
"On 31 January, it will have another chance to prove its leadership by coming forward with 30%, and I ask that the EU offer that figure."
"I would appreciate your response to this proposal, as it represents the only way to show leadership and make 2010 the year of the United Nations, the European Union and the climate."
"Mr President, I support the environmental goals for 2020, but I have some serious doubts about some methods."
"The Copenhagen conference was a good example of a bad method."
"And what were the lessons?"
"The conference was too massive to be productive: a rock concert of 50 000 people is possible; a meeting, not."
"Secondly, Europe was outfoxed by China and India, and the US joined in."
"Instead of being a decisive player, the EU was a confused spectator."
"What should we do?"
"I think we have to reassess the form we used, rather a G20 than an event of Woodstock proportions."
"Secondly, we have to stop displaying moral arrogance by telling China and India what to do."
"Important barriers to punish both countries would be disastrous."
"On the contrary, the EU should re-examine its own stance, which will ultimately undermine our own growth and employment."
"Finally, we need serious research on the body of evidence."
"'Climategate' was already a reminder, and the claim that the Himalayan glaciers are retreating now seems to be based on speculation."
"Some members of the IPCC now even predict global cooling."
"We need objective, impartial scientific research, and not an agenda-driven political activism."
"What is true and what is not: at present, we simply do not know, and I think we need to have the facts right, first."
"Commissioner, Minister, I hope you will look at these questions with an open mind."
"(DE) Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations."
"As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy."
"There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet."
"The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns."
"The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough."
"Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity."
"The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes."
"Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets."
"Mr President, you can, of course, tell that I am a sceptic because I do not dress like a scarecrow."
"I fought my way through the blizzard in Copenhagen, like many of you did."
"It is interesting, is it not, that we have had the coldest winter so far on record in London for 30 years?"
"It is the same in Poland, Korea and China."
"We have had the coldest temperatures in Florida, Arizona, Texas - the first snow in Texas, I think, for a hundred years."
"Of course, as Giles Coren of the London Times said, my goodness me, we simply do not get it - of course that is what global warming is all about: we have got to get used to freezing temperatures."
"Well, we have seen the Al Gore hockey stick, which is still, I gather, being shown in London state schools - Al Gore, snake oil salesman, crook!"
"We have seen Professor Jones from the University of East Anglia - crook!"
"And now - you will not know about this yet because it has been kept out of the public domain - the New Zealand National Climate Database: I have the figures here - all fraudulent."
"When are you all going to wake up?"
"Scam, scam, scam!"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, apparently all the science of climate change is nonsense, according to Mr Bloom, because we have had a cold winter."
"I wonder if Mr Bloom would like to tell the House the difference between climate and weather."
"Climate, Mr Davies, is what we all have to put up with."
"(HU) Minister, I have surprising news for you."
"The climate conference in Copenhagen is over."
"You talk about targets and illusions as if we were still before the event."
"It ended in failure."
"No legally binding commitments were signed."
"The example of Kyoto shows what voluntarism means."
"We are all aware of the value of the United States' undertakings, but Canada is also worth mentioning."
"Canada signed the Kyoto Treaty, and then increased its carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% without any consequences."
"Copenhagen is a clear message about the world we are living in."
"The world today is determined by economic fundamentalism."
"Whenever the interests of society face the interests of the global economy, the latter always wins."
"Of course, behind the global economy there is a small power elite."
"In order to stop irreversible climate change, we would need to change another climate."
"We need to change the political and moral climate."
"Before doing so, as long as people serve the economy and not the other way around, until the eco-social market economy becomes the guiding principle, all similar conferences are condemned to failure."
"(DE) Mr President, if we can learn anything from Copenhagen, then it is a sense of reality."
"I still remember the debate we had here in this House before Copenhagen."
"Everyone was glowing with optimism, but it came to nothing."
"It was an international conference with its own rules, and we can achieve little with good will alone."
"So, let us approach the next negotiations in Mexico with the necessary sense of reality."
"If we were to assess Copenhagen, we have to say, to be fair, that it was not so bad, because the result can serve as a basis for the negotiations in Mexico and something, at least, was achieved."
"The greatest disappointment for us Europeans has to be that we - the EU - were not there when the final document was drawn up."
"That must give us pause for thought, because we are always emphasising the fact that we are the ones who want to take a leading role in the global fight against climate change."
"Why should this be?"
"First of all, probably because, with our 14% CO2 emissions, we are not among the largest emitters."
"The US and China together account for almost half."
"However, in Europe, we do not speak with one voice."
"The last Environment Council showed very clearly how different the views are there."
"Many Member States view the problem very differently to the majority in this House, for example."
"However, another reason is surely the fact that we Europeans are not as good as we always claim to be."
"If we take these clean development mechanisms, in other words, these joint implementation measures, and the other measures out of the equation and consider only our own measures for reducing CO2 emissions, then we can see that our balance sheet is not as good as we maintain."
"Thirdly, we also have to say that other countries and other regions of the world have a different approach to this problem."
"Our big goal is a legally binding agreement."
"However, China and the US are opting for a different route."
"Overall, we need to consider whether we should not be more flexible in our negotiations, because working together to combat the phenomenon of climate change is important, but the methods we employ to achieve this could be quite different."
"(DA) Mr President, the question that I would put to the climate sceptics in this House is this: if nine out of ten doctors told you they were more than ninety percent sure that you were seriously ill, but that they had some medicine that could cure your illness - a medicine with no side effects - would you take the medicine?"
"Of course you would."
"That is how the world should have reacted in Copenhagen."
"That is how the world should of course react when more than ninety percent of leading researchers in the field say that global warming is real and that it is man-made."
"The EU should therefore demonstrate leadership."
"Obviously, we can criticise the US."
"Obviously, we can criticise China for not having had the political will required in Copenhagen."
"In this House, however, we must look nearer home - we must be critical of the lack of initiative shown by the EU."
"The EU could have done two things, and it should do two things before the conference in Mexico."
"Firstly, we should take the lead as regards committing ourselves to reduction targets."
"That means moving from the 20 per cent reductions promised by 2020 to 30 per cent."
"Secondly, we should name the amounts we are willing to contribute to financing long-term adjustment to the climate changes that we know are coming."
"Finally, it is obvious that we will also have more of an impact if we speak with one voice, because we will then be able to negotiate more rationally and clearly than we were able to in Copenhagen. Mr Callanan of the European Conservatives and Reformists said: It would be crazy to raise our ambitions in the current state."
"No, Mr Callanan, it would be crazy not to raise our ambitions!"
"It would be crazy to raise our ambitions in the current state."
"No, Mr Callanan, it would be crazy not to raise our ambitions!"
"(SV) The Copenhagen Summit was, without doubt, a great disappointment, but the important thing now is to look to the future."
"That is what we liberals are doing, and I hope that we can do so together in Europe."
"We need a strategy and we need a 'post-Copenhagen agenda'."
"An important tool for achieving this is continued investment in the emissions trading system."
"The EU should immediately open negotiations with the US to integrate the emerging American system with the European system."
"A transatlantic market for carbon emissions could be the start of a global market."
"Mr Rehn gave an extremely good introductory address."
"He is quite right in his conclusion."
"The EU must speak with one voice in these negotiations."
"However, it must be borne in mind that under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament can now influence how these decisions are taken."
"Parliament has to be involved in the preparatory work, since a final agreement requires our endorsement."
"Within Europe, we must, at the same time, continue to strengthen our own carbon market and stop giving away trading rights for free."
"We need to invest in new technology and thirdly, we need to set a price floor for carbon dioxide."
"The climate targets can be reached through the mechanisms of the market, not through more bureaucracy."
"If we now put the Copenhagen conference behind us, make a new start and put all our efforts into future measures, then the first thing we need to focus on is EU 2020."
"The measures are included there and we need to have well-honed proposals as regards energy efficiency and how we invest in new technology."
"We need a climate jobs strategy."
"Finally, I would like to say that clearly, we need a 30 per cent reduction in carbon emissions if we want to win not just the battle for the climate, but also the battle for the market."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, I have been very surprised at the self-satisfaction you show with regard to EU action in the climate field."
"It is true that Europe has done more and better work in the last 10 years than most of the other countries in the world, but there was clearly a failure of European leadership in Copenhagen."
"In Copenhagen, we also saw Europe become simply the combination of the personal communication strategies of the European Heads of State or Government, and I should like to specifically mention Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel and Mr Brown in this connection."
"Under these circumstances, it is clearly easy to knock the UN process."
"It is true that the UN system is complicated, and that a G20, where the agreements are meaningless but there are opportunities for major publicity stunts, is much simpler."
"This means that this coming year, Europe must do more and better work."
"We currently have a 20% target."
"However, 20% actually means doing less in the next 10 years than we have done in the past 10 years; it means reducing Europe's climate effort."
"This is not only absurd for the climate, when the scientists are telling us that we have to reach a 40% target, but it is also absurd for our economy and jobs."
"Therefore, Mrs Espinosa, please do not reduce Europe's climate ambition to the lowest common denominator, to the objectives voiced by President Barroso, who does not want to budge from the 20% figure, or to those voiced by Italy and Poland, which will soon deny the existence of climate change."
"Reread Parliament's resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30%."
"(PL) Mr President, we have to accept the fact that no one, with the exception of several European states, wants to pay for restrictions on CO2 emissions, or to cut back on their energy use."
"It is even worse than this."
"Some developing countries, using irritating anti-colonial rhetoric, want to get rich on this, while at the same time being the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."
"African countries, China and India want to keep their exemptions not to submit to the international system of monitoring emissions and, at the same time, receive billions of euros for clean technologies."
"This is a position we cannot justify to our taxpayers."
"After the Copenhagen conference, we must get it into our heads that Europe cannot bear these costs on its own."
"Firstly, because acting on our own, we will slow down the growth of our economy even more, and strike at the prosperity of our citizens."
"Secondly, by acting on our own, we will not change anything connected with emissions, because we have already managed to limit our own emissions."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, although Copenhagen was a failure, the mobilisation of non-governmental actors was exceptional and revealed that there is true international support for climate justice."
"From now on, it will be a given that the continuing negotiation process will have to take into account, as a matter of priority, the interests of the small vulnerable island states and of Africa."
"It will also be crucial to ensure that the USD 100 billion announced in Copenhagen is indeed in addition to the commitments made in the area of official development assistance."
"Finally, we must bear in mind the fact that we have very little time in which to act before the consequences of climate change become irreversible."
"The year 2010 represents our last chance if we want to ensure real success in Mexico City."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do not say that we did not warn you about this."
"The resolution on COP 15 passed by this Parliament was all smoke and no fire."
"We asked for too much and we have achieved nothing."
"Those are not the words of the Lega Nord but of Ivo de Boer, secretary of the UN climate change conference. It has not really been a disaster, even if the agreement is merely a letter of intent."
"The text which prevented COP 15 from drawing a complete blank, agreed at the end of a marathon of negotiations of a truly unprecedented duration and intensity, contains very little substance."
"The Copenhagen Accord, agreed by US President Obama, Brazilian President Lula, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Indian Prime Minister Singh and South African President Zuma, and imposed on all the remaining countries, has not even been formally adopted."
"Following its rejection by eight countries, which prevented its adoption, the Accord was merely taken note of by the plenary of the 192 participating states."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the global warming story is a waste of time."
"Since December, newspapers and television news programmes have been reporting that Europe is in the grip of freezing cold weather."
"Let us avoid useless and costly speculation about the climate."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the only concrete result of the climate summit in Copenhagen was the limiting of global warming to two degrees Celsius."
"The measures needed for this, however, have remained a mystery. This minimal compromise is disappointing for us, particularly since it is now up to each individual State to decide whether or not to accept the agreement on climate protection goals."
"Time really is running out."
"It is up to us to now decide what happens next."
"We should promote sustainable, climate-protecting development, which allows us to use the resources of our planet in a responsible way, for us and for future generations."
"The EU and its Member States should develop their world-leading role in green technologies."
"Then we will at least have made a start."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, nobody could have failed to notice that Copenhagen was a wasted opportunity."
"However - and, yes, I am echoing your words here, Commissioner - this summit still had two virtues."
"The first was that it mobilised many more Heads of State or Government than the Kyoto Summit did."
"The second is that it enabled emerging countries to benefit from financial commitments aimed specifically at helping them to combat global warming."
"So what should Europe do now?"
"Of course, it should continue its excellent work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, because the truth is that Europe has already been extremely virtuous."
"With regard to the Kyoto target, which was an 8% reduction, European companies have achieved a reduction of just under 13%."
"The latter have therefore shown themselves to be extremely virtuous and very committed to the protection of the environment."
"However, this fight and this virtuous attitude absolutely must not be situated in a context of unfair competition."
"As I told you at the hearings, Mr Rehn, all this can be situated only in a context of completely fair competition."
"Indeed, we must consider implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union, because we cannot abandon our businesses and thus our jobs to completely unfair competition, to the advantage of countries that show no respect for, or do not apply the same standards regarding, environmental protection and greenhouse gas reduction."
"I therefore think it is absolutely essential - and I echo my fellow Member Mrs Lepage here - that, at some time in the future, we give thought to implementing a carbon tax at the borders of the European Union."
"Secondly, I was rather delighted to learn at the hearings that Commissioner Tajani has not ruled out the undertaking of an impact study on the possibility of imposing this carbon tax at the borders of the European Union."
"Therefore, little by little, I think that we are going to win this battle, because it is important to protect our European companies and jobs."
"(EL) Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, we would certainly have preferred today's debate to be held under different circumstances, where we would be called upon to evaluate a global, legally binding agreement and to decide, as the European Union, on what to do next."
"Unfortunately, the results from Copenhagen were well below par in the circumstances."
"That is the first main reason we are expressing our disappointment."
"The second reason we are expressing our disappointment and which particularly concerns us as the European Parliament is the poor figure cut by the European Union at the Copenhagen Summit."
"While one would have expected that, at the first global summit following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union would have spearheaded an effort to achieve a new, ambitious, substantial, global agreement on combating climate change, we and the European citizens witnessed a show of fragmentation, with some European leaders playing their own game and the European Union playing the role of sidekick and spectator."
"This is not the role we would wish for or the role which befits us."
"So what needs to be done?"
"We call on the European Commission and the Council to show that it is up to the job and to safeguard a leading role for Europe in this new endeavour."
"May I remind you that it is not merely a question of restricting the repercussions of climate change."
"It is a much broader challenge; the challenge of changing to a new development model, a green development model which will be Europe's answer to the need to create new jobs, to support the competitiveness of the European economy and to consolidate the leading role of the European Union in the new order."
"The outcome of Copenhagen was deeply disappointing, but we must now move forward."
"The EU needs to commit itself now to a 30% cut in emissions for three reasons."
"The first is simply that a 30% cut requires barely more effort now than the original 20% cut, simply because of the fall in economic activity due to the recession."
"Secondly, to rein back now would be to lose the momentum which has been built up in the new green industries."
"We cannot 'half-commit' to investment in renewable energy sources and low-carbon transport."
"There is massive infrastructure which needs to be put in place, whether it is a North Sea supergrid or, on a smaller scale, plug-in charging points for electric cars."
"Hundreds and thousands of new jobs are at stake, potentially 70 000 jobs relating to offshore wind in the UK alone, but these jobs, which are so necessary for economic recovery, will only be realised if there is a clear roadmap towards a zero-carbon Europe by 2050."
"Investment has to have certainty, and we need to be aware that Europe is in danger of losing its place as leader on renewable technology."
"Both the US and China are growing their renewables industries very rapidly."
"If we hesitate now, those new green jobs will move to other continents."
"Finally, we need that 30% cut because most of the extra commitment can easily be realised by increased energy efficiency."
"Not to do more on energy efficiency would, in any case, be crazy."
"Energy efficiency means economic efficiency."
"It means lower energy bills, not higher ones, and it improves energy security."
"So, whatever figures are put on the table by the other parties on 31 January - and maybe we will be pleasantly surprised - the EU must commit now to a 30% cut."
"(CS) When reviewing the Copenhagen Summit and its results, one should employ common sense and look through the prism of the multitude of available environmental and economic data confirming that there is no such thing as global warming, and if it does exist, it is totally beyond human control, being caused purely by natural forces."
"By the way, we learnt last week that a significant portion of the environmental data used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was either knowingly falsified or misinterpreted."
"Seen in this light, it is good to see that the Copenhagen Summit has failed."
"I do hope that this failure will, first of all, bring a departure from the aggressive so-called 'green' politics."
"Secondly, politics will get back to genuine topics that really concern people in today's economic recession."
"Thirdly, it will prevent the waste of taxpayers' money on controversial green projects."
"Fourthly, it will create space for a matter-of-fact debate on the rational, efficient and cheaper provision of energy, and we will see the renaissance of nuclear energy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when I meet my constituents, they shake their heads with incredulity over the topics we discuss here, failing as we do to deal with their real problems."
"(PT) Mr President, despite its urgency, what we saw in Copenhagen was several steps backwards."
"Copenhagen did indeed mobilise more heads of state than Kyoto, but it also created more divisions and, as a result, it turned into a scenario of 'every man for himself', where every state can set out their goals and, moreover, do so on a voluntary basis."
"We should note that we have a target reduction of 2 degree Celsius and goals for funding without any explanation whatsoever."
"These cannot be seen as a consolation."
"However, I believe that we have to act with an eye to the future, and this means moving from words to actions."
"The European Union always wants to be a leader, and always has. However, when we arrived in Copenhagen, it faltered, failing to define or defend the goals that it had stated here, and which it said that it would never give up."
"My question here, then, is whether in the future we will not act more fairly, whether we will continue to allow a situation where the poorest people go on paying the heaviest price due to our weakness and the decisions of some people over others."
"(FI) Mr President, the Copenhagen climate summit was a complete flop."
"I voted against the resolution here in December."
"I was right, like 92 others here."
"The European Union very arrogantly endeavoured to offer the entire world its own solution."
"A few days before it began, emissions trading fraud worth EUR 5 billion was exposed."
"This must have been embarrassing just before the meeting was due to start, with the EU offering a way out and facing abuses of funds worth EUR 5 billion."
"This was shameful, and is the EU now at all worried that these abuses will be investigated?"
"If we are to impose restrictions on emissions, let us introduce a specific emissions system, as we have with cars."
"It works, although there is never a case for winding down our steel, metal or wood processing industries, in Finland or in the EU countries."
"That is to no avail: workers and employees should not be made to suffer."
"(Applause)"
"(SL) I, too, am disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen conference, but let us stop bemoaning the poor results and let us instead think where we go from here, so that we do not meet with further disappointment."
"Telling ourselves 'Let us build upon the work we have done because we just need to make some changes' is not enough."
"The first question I wish to ask myself in this respect is what COP conferences are in the first place?"
"Are they real conferences or just a display for the public?"
"They are both, of course."
"However, we need to ensure that experts can get on with their jobs and that the public is informed, not only about the informal events which take place on the fringes of conferences, but also about the actual work we are doing."
"Europe should, therefore, reconsider the organisational aspects of such conferences."
"My second question is: What is the role of world leaders at such conferences?"
"Do they come to these conferences in order to pursue their domestic political campaigns or do they come to help participants reach a compromise?"
"I think we also need to reconsider the working methods of such conferences and the roles of the world leaders who attend them."
"My third question concerns the leading role of the European Union."
"Yes, we have taken many good measures to ensure that Europe can maintain its leading role in developing environmentally friendly technologies, but we have lost our leading role in the negotiating process."
"In my opinion, we should not settle for playing merely a coordinating role in the negotiating process, because we have to be an active negotiator ourselves."
"That is why we should not lay all our cards on the table before negotiations begin and trumpet the goals we are after."
"We should also be trying to bring ourselves closer to third countries, not distance ourselves from them."
"The final point I wish to make is that we must include in our international meetings the issue of climate change as a matter of urgency and here, of course, I expect close cooperation by both of the commissioners in charge of these two areas."
"(ES) Today, at the start of 2010, we are not where we would have hoped to be in the fight against climate change."
"We are not there because right now, we should be at the stage of moving towards the adoption of legislative changes brought about by an agreement reached in Copenhagen."
"We are not at that stage, and we should be sorry."
"We should regret the fact that, in Copenhagen, ambitions were lowered in the fight against climate change, that a binding agreement was not signed and that the procedure lacked transparency."
"Consequently, we do not have the sufficient legal base or means to cater for people's needs, especially in developing countries."
"However, nor are we at the stage we were at before Copenhagen, because in Copenhagen, we did reach a targeted agreement with the United States, China, India, South Africa and Brazil, to which other countries later signed up, such as Russia, Australia, Norway, Sweden and Spain."
"We should not forget that, together, those countries are responsible for three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions; nor should we forget that many of those countries were previously outside the Kyoto Protocol."
"Therefore, the step we have taken is not enough, but it is significant."
"We should take advantage of that significant step in order to push forward from within the European Union."
"The European Union has been the driving force for all the progress that has been made."
"However, that progress will not continue unless the European Union keeps pushing."
"With a view to Germany and Mexico, we have to work to reach binding agreements and to obtain resources that can help developing countries to mitigate their emissions, to adapt and to update their technology."
"We have to do this for reasons of efficiency, fairness and because we are in need of more partners."
"I am sure that the Spanish Presidency will work towards that end."
"Mr President, I have good news for the House: in common with many scientists, I personally have concluded that there is no climate crisis!"
"Global sea levels are not rising significantly and, as the IPCC has been forced to admit, Himalayan glaciers are not in rapid retreat."
"The small increase in mean global temperatures over the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term, natural climate changes."
"Copenhagen showed that many nations, especially China and India, are simply not prepared to sacrifice economic performance to solve an entirely speculative problem."
"In Britain, a majority of voters no longer believe in man-made climate change and they will not pay for futile and pointless attempts at mitigation."
"The recent leaked CRU memos show that even the high priests of climate alarmism are in despair at the failure of nature to follow their forecasts, so they are falsifying the figures to sustain their fantasy."
"We must now demand a full public inquiry into the suspect data before we spend another penny on mitigation."
"(PT) Mr President, the United States and the European Union, the first and second largest emitters in the world per capita respectively, have a definite and unavoidable responsibility for the failure of Copenhagen, which no amount of passing the buck can diminish."
"Among other aspects mentioned here, the summit failed as regards funding for the so-called 'adaptation' for developing countries, due to the insufficient number of those who made commitments."
"At the same time, the burdens on these countries continue to be hypocritically ignored."
"These include their enormous foreign debt, an amount that is truly astronomical when compared with the level of funding announced, and which severely limits any real possibility of sustainable economic and social development."
"The summit foundered on the serious discussion of the perverse results of the market-based instruments and the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Among other problems, the summit failed to address the causes of climate change beyond its effects."
"This is an irrational way of approaching economic and social issues, and it precludes any solution for this or any other problems that humanity ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this Copenhagen agreement, a two percent goal was accepted by 180 member countries, but it is still not legally binding."
"Not much came of all of the plans that we made here."
"It all went wrong in Copenhagen."
"It could also be called a defeat."
"It is important to describe the situation accurately in order to have the opportunity to think carefully about why this happened, so that we can then make some progress on this matter."
"I am slightly shocked by some of the speeches I have heard here."
"People are saying 'we need to fight harder', 'let us continue to do what we have been doing', 'we need a higher percentage', 'more money', 'the problem was simply not enough unity in Europe' - I think these statements are too casual, too superficial in their analysis of the situation."
"Simply carrying on and marching forward is not the solution."
"These were not the reasons for this outcome."
"Have we actually considered and discussed with one another all of the essential issues in a fair and objective way?"
"How have we dealt with the questions of fellow Members, whether justified or not, who said 'we have questions about issues that we are critical of, climate-sceptical questions'?"
"How did we respond in the Committee on Climate Change when fellow Members said 'we also want to hear the other point of view - the opposing position of some scientists'?"
"What opportunity did we actually have to present that?"
"Moreover, regardless of which position we take, we need to discuss calmly how we should deal with the recent information that fellow Members have also just mentioned that the IPCC made a mistake with regard to the melting of glaciers?"
"A second set of questions also needs answers."
"Are we using the right instruments to tackle this?"
"There are always new timetables, more percentages, new regulations and stipulations."
"This is a rather bureaucratic approach."
"Is Mrs Ek not right to emphasise so strongly that technology, innovation and market mechanisms are the way forward here?"
"Other states are taking different approaches, but it is not the case that they are doing nothing."
"Perhaps a bit more openness and a bit more reflection will give us a chance to be more effective in this matter."
"This is what I would like to see, rather than the method of 'shut your eyes and advance'."
"Mr President, I do not want to depict a doom scenario, as has been done here."
"I do not want to depict a doom scenario for the future, nor do I want to look back in anger about the failure of Copenhagen - although I am angry."
"Therefore, the resolution is to do far better in the future, the next opportunity being Mexico this year."
"Firstly, do not walk alone next time."
"In Copenhagen, we looked back and we stood alone in our ambitions."
"We must be able to convince others to be as ambitious as we are."
"How can we claim to be in the driver's seat if we fail to convince others of our ambitions and of the destination?"
"Secondly, no one size fits all."
"As sometimes was proudly said during the run-up to the climate summit, there is no plan 'B'. Well, we certainly know it: there is nothing right now."
"We have nothing."
"So we had better have a plan 'B' next time."
"Last, but not least, how can we win in diversity if our slogan is, I mean, unity."
"We had better unite next time, and that means one voice."
"We need a univocal mandate."
"Europe really needs one voice."
"So, President-in-Office, are you willing to commit yourselves to obtaining an exclusive - and not a shared - mandate?"
"It would be an exclusive competence for the European Union in climate policy and climate agreements."
"(PL) Mr President, the climate, and nature itself, which is all around us, belong to all people, including future generations, and that is why we must feel responsible for their protection."
"During the recent climate summit, world leaders did not manage to come to an understanding on a common strategy or instruments to help reach this objective."
"Paradoxically, I do not think this is bad news, in view of the disturbing information which is coming from, among others, Great Britain and the United States, about an attempt at manipulation by certain lobbies, using scientific data to achieve a specific result."
"We need a reliable diagnosis of the situation."
"Therefore, I appeal for the appointment of an independent, international expert group, which will compile a thorough report stating whether human activity really does affect climate change and if data has been falsified."
"When establishing a common strategy for protecting the climate, EU politicians should also take into account the economic disproportions between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe."
"In view of the crisis, the measures which have been proposed could lead to the ruin of many economies."
"Mr President, Minister, the Copenhagen conference ended with a result that was a long way from what was expected."
"The countries took note of a document whose objectives were unclear and not binding."
"Copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit."
"There was a new correlation between prominent players on the world stage and the proper role of multilateralism in the UN system."
"The growing influence of the emerging countries was evident."
"Copenhagen showed that we need to rethink the role of Europe on the world stage."
"We will need to make the most of the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to prepare the way for the next COP."
"We need to be ambitious, united with one voice and forging strategic alliances."
"The result of Copenhagen forms a foundation for us to build on with further work."
"The EU should try to ensure that the next stages in the negotiations will further develop the Copenhagen Agreement, with a view to reaching a legally binding agreement by the end of this year."
"It should also contribute to the implementation of provisions for giving funding to developing countries, and with regard to forests, technology transfer and adaptation measures."
"Internally, Europe has a big task ahead: it needs to implement the energy and climate package, to invest in clean technologies, scientific research and energy efficiency, to invest in a new industrial policy based on innovation and the efficiency of natural resources, to promote policies on low-carbon cities and sustainable transport and mobility."
"This is the only way that we can lead, but real leadership is based on providing a good example."
"(HU) Mr President, Copenhagen showed us that the EU failed to find partners for its far-reaching ideas."
"In the future, the EU must not give up its targets, the commitment of three times 20% but, at the same time, it should reconsider its negotiating position and mandate, because we cannot pursue an ostrich policy."
"The lessons from Copenhagen should be learnt."
"That mandate was not successful."
"We failed to understand the commitment of China and other developing countries."
"We failed to understand the room Mr Obama had to manoeuvre and we were unable to speak with a common voice."
"As part of the debate of the Spanish Presidency, the President, Mr Verhofstadt, rightly stated that Europe had no common voice."
"We cannot pursue an ostrich policy."
"After Copenhagen, we cannot behave and we cannot do politics the same way as we did before Copenhagen."
"The EU should reposition itself and set a new mandate by the time of the negotiating round in Mexico."
"First of all, we should investigate how to achieve the 2o C target, which is the result of Copenhagen."
"During the next period, European policy should be aimed at establishing a flexible position in order to achieve success. Thank you for your attention."
"(NL) Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, this morning, the Nationale Voorleesontbijt (national reading-aloud breakfast) was held in Dutch schools."
"In my constituency, in Noordwijk aan Zee, which lies just behind the North Sea dunes in an area that will be first in the firing line if the sea level rises, the schoolchildren were told a story entitled 'A meeting', about snowmen deliberating how to keep the warmth at bay."
"They talk and talk until they have all melted."
"To be frank, on a bad day, this debate does remind me a little of that."
"It is true that Copenhagen was not a success."
"Now we could continue to point to other countries or individual sectors; these one-liners have occasionally cropped up in the present debate, too."
"Yet it strikes me as a better idea to look ahead to what Europe can, and, more importantly, must do in order to shoulder its responsibility and ensure that an international agreement is still reached."
"Hence, in my opinion, the option of a 30% reduction must be kept expressly on the table."
"In addition, Europe must look at ways of promoting new technologies, including with European funds, for example, by promoting the construction of CO2-neutral greenhouses that are also capable of producing energy, instead of us always viewing agriculture as a problem."
"Moreover, we must base our approach on science, knowledge and skills and not on emotions, however much we all care about this debate."
"Finally, as many of my fellow Members have already said, we must speak with one voice."
"There should be only one seat for Europe in Mexico rather than the eight that were apparently needed in Copenhagen."
"President-in-Office, how do you plan to achieve this together with the Commissioners with responsibility in this field?"
"Mr President, the hope generated by years of preparation descended into despondency and despair as it became increasingly clear that the deal we had come to agree in Copenhagen was slipping from our grasp as each day passed."
"We must be concerned about how easy it was for the US, China and others to circumvent the UN structures, sideline the EU and agree an arrangement which fell far short of global expectations."
"One thing is clear."
"The UN climate talks system needs life-saving surgery before Mexico at the end of this year."
"As it stands, President Obama is a prisoner of his political system, for he needs 67 votes in the Senate."
"China refuses all measures which would be binding and open to international scrutiny."
"The irony of the situation is that, the longer the US, China and others frustrate, delay and prevaricate on a deal, the tougher the targets for reduction will, of necessity, become."
"Let us look at solutions."
"The EU and this Parliament need to examine honestly how it approaches such matters in the future."
"Europe must be much more assertive in standing up for itself and, in doing so, should continue to set ambitious targets involving targets and emissions reductions of 30%."
"This is an economic race to lead the world into the 21st century based on green jobs and sustainable living."
"Europe must win that race regardless of what our friends do or do not do."
"(ES) I would like to welcome Mrs Espinosa;"
"I am very pleased that she is here."
"I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude."
"Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said."
"Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change."
"The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context."
"Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop."
"We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change."
"Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone."
"A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere."
"What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science."
"In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever."
"How are we going to coordinate on this matter?"
"That is another very important question."
"How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement?"
"We should have already started working on that this morning."
"Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity."
"We are lacking that vision."
"On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said many times already, of course, the summit was a failure."
"We are miles away from our objectives."
"Over the next few months, we shall have to see if things can still be put right."
"I believe, however - as others have also said before - that there is still a great deal we can put right ourselves, even without an international agreement under the auspices of the United Nations."
"I am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system."
"A priority objective was to reduce aviation emissions by 10% by 2020 working through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and maritime transport emissions by 20% through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)."
"Thus, I should like to ask the Council and the Commission to continue negotiations within these organisations and to step up the pressure by starting to prepare unilateral measures already if an agreement cannot be reached in a relatively short period of time."
"In the meanwhile, of course, there is a great deal of homework we can be doing ourselves."
"With regard to intra-European transport, I heard Commissioner-designate Hedegaard advocate an ambitious climate and transport package during the hearings."
"Commissioner-designate Kallas seemed rather less clear, but I would remind the Commission that transport accounts for 25% of CO2 emissions and, as such, requires urgent action."
"It is complicated, it is difficult and it requires a combination of measures, but I call on you to continue working on it and thus to make an important contribution to a more sustainable policy."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we no longer need to demonstrate the importance of the issue of climate change."
"Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics' position."
"The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change."
"The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference."
"The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure."
"The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees."
"Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings."
"Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets."
"I am thinking here of Japan and Norway."
"I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation."
"A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO2 to be stored naturally."
"Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment."
"I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action."
"I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations."
"To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area."
"The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets."
"I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union."
"(NL) I concur with what Mrs de Lange said on behalf of our delegation from the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in this debate."
"I, too, am disappointed that the legal agreement failed to materialise, and I should like to put a question to the President-in-Office."
"What are the implications of the lack of such an agreement for our legislative framework, namely the package we have laid down for CO2 trading, among other things?"
"What will be the impact on that system?"
"Can you tell us that?"
"I should like to point out, chiefly in my role as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for regional policy, that our objectives must be retained in full."
"Also, Europe should not question the efforts of citizens, towns and cities, regions and enterprises that have committed themselves to the package of implementing programmes."
"The climate issue is not just hype, and I also note that, fortunately, it is enshrined in the EU 2020 strategy of the new Commission."
"I would also point out that we have now turned the EU's own instruments and resources towards climate-related priorities: 30% of regional funds have been channelled to the climate and to energy-related projects, which is double the figure for the previous period."
"This particular priority creates scope to continue with the innovation and new green technology that will help give us the edge at a global level."
"This also goes for expenditure under the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"I believe that this sets a positive trend, including for the financing beyond 2013."
"I do indeed note great commitment in regions, towns and cities to continue working on this."
"It would send the wrong message - in the desperation that may be perceptible in a number of speeches here - to diminish this ambition."
"I share your hope that, in Mexico - our second chance - we shall do better."
"(HU) Mr President, we should not embellish things."
"Copenhagen was a failure."
"I do not want to focus on this, however, but suggest that instead of criticising others, we would do better to mind our own business."
"We have to admit that one of the reasons behind the failure was the lack of a common European position in Copenhagen, either in terms of CO2 quotas or funding."
"I agree with those who say that it is the prerequisite of successful negotiations to have a common EU position."
"That is true."
"What do we need in order to achieve this?"
"It is necessary that the Commission and all Member States of the European Union adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the Kyoto Treaty."
"Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, Slovakia and the Czech Republic fulfilled their commitments beyond the level determined in Kyoto."
"Therefore, they can sell their CO2 quotas."
"I think it is dishonourable, unfair and inappropriate on behalf of the Commission and the other European Union Member States to deprive these countries of this opportunity."
"In Copenhagen, Poland and Hungary suggested a compromise."
"The point of it was to retain the possibility of selling the quotas beyond 2012, but its volume per year should be limited, and the money received should be spent on green investments."
"We suggested a compromise for the sake of a common European position."
"Now it is up to the Commission and the EU-15, especially because without Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the other countries, the EU-15 could not state to have delivered on their commitments, since instead of the 8% undertaken, only 5.5% would have been achieved. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Mr President, the negotiations have highlighted the failure of the EU's strategy, which was aimed at making others follow in its wake by being the most virtuous."
"The reality is that there was a gulf between the rhetoric of an EU wishing to be the world leader in the fight against climate change and its capacity to get others on board in the final negotiations."
"Not only did nobody come on board but, by putting all its cards on the table far too early, failure was inevitable."
"In fact, the EU was virtually inaudible during the final negotiations."
"So what are we to do now?"
"We must, above all, implement the principle of reciprocity in our exchanges with third countries."
"Europe can no longer accept a situation in which certain imported products do not satisfy environmental requirements."
"The situation brought about by the failure in Copenhagen therefore creates uncertainty as to the future international operational rules in the area of carbon emissions reduction, which is particularly harmful for those companies of ours that are required to make major investments."
"This lack of visibility could also have a detrimental impact on the CO2 market, the rise in power and smooth running of which require a clear and stable framework."
"At the same time, the United States and China are investing massively in green technologies to create the green jobs of tomorrow."
"Europe must not miss the innovation train."
"It must support a real European industrial policy because that is the real challenge of the fight against climate change."
"These new clean technologies are available; it is up to us to accelerate their use in our policies for the benefit of everybody, and especially of developing countries."
"That is the challenge that must be taken up by the EU."
"It has the means to successfully undertake this revolution, but let us be more pragmatic as we approach the next deadlines so that, a year from now in Mexico City, we can turn the agreement concluded in Copenhagen into something legally binding."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Espinosa, Commissioner, the Spanish Presidency has decided to prepare an evaluation of the Copenhagen climate conference, while we are saying here, according to many speakers, that it ended in a fiasco."
"However, a fiasco does not have to be a disaster - sometimes you have to draw good conclusions from a fiasco and see what really caused it."
"Current European Union strategy for negotiation on climate protection needs to be evaluated, because preparations are under way for the next summit, to be held in Mexico in December this year."
"I have a question: should we increase the reduction objective, since the current objective was not achieved in these negotiations?"
"We have to find partners for the present objective, and for an increased objective we do not have any partners at all."
"It needs to be pointed out that without the United States, China and India, and this has also been said many times in this Chamber during this debate, there will be no success with the objectives set by the European Union at the Copenhagen Summit."
"It will be similar in Mexico, too."
"We must evaluate the declaration of the other parties, maintaining, above all, the forum of the climate conference as the main forum for negotiation of an understanding, irrespective of the critical evaluations as to whether the UN forum is appropriate, good, working properly, etc."
"We want a green economy, which makes rational use of the environment and which develops new sources of energy and new technologies to generate energy and to save it."
"At the same time, we know that the cheapest energy is energy which has not been exhausted, and so we need to be rational."
"By the way - and this is my last sentence - reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases is not achieved by the use of expensive technologies."
"Very often, our own resources, such as forests and soil, can also be an excellent place for absorption, and this is biological absorption and, hence, effective absorption."
"Unlike this morning, when we were in such a rush, we now have a few minutes at our disposal; so, breaking with the usual rule, we are going to try to give the floor to all those who have asked to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure."
"I would, however, ask all of you to keep your speech under one minute."
"We will cut your speeches off after one minute, because 13 people are on the list."
"I want everyone to have a chance to speak, but for Mrs Espinosa and Commissioner Rehn to be able to respond, you must all speak for just one minute."
"(RO) In line with expectations, the Copenhagen Summit did not end with any concrete results."
"However, we have a clear view on the phenomenon of global warming and the need to take action."
"The European Union must continue its efforts at foreign policy level, especially discussions with the United States and China."
"Positive results should be achieved."
"We have commissioners for both foreign policy and climate change."
"Until then, the actions which the European Union has taken so far, even those taken unilaterally, must be continued."
"I hope that at the informal meeting in Seville in January, environment ministers will deal with the outcome of Copenhagen pragmatically and consider climate change in the context of the future Action Plan for Energy Efficiency for 2010-2014."
"In addition, the third package of measures for the internal energy market must be coordinated with the Copenhagen Agreement in order to achieve energy security, promote renewable energy, and capture and store carbon dioxide."
"Mr President, a question to the President-in-Office, and maybe to the Commission as well, about this deadline of 31 January."
"What is happening about the pledges inside the EU?"
"I assumed the EU would make one pledge, but I am hearing that in Coreper, they are discussing several pledges."
"What exactly is happening?"
"Secondly, we talk about one voice for Europe, but is it not part of the problem that the EU went to Copenhagen with a mandate and there was no flexibility for the negotiating team to negotiate?"
"That is part of the problem."
"That is why the EU is cut out of the final negotiations."
"Why talk to a negotiator who cannot move at all and has no flexibility?"
"How are we going to resolve this?"
"I am told that the same thing happens at the WTO."
"It is a big problem for the EU."
"Finally, I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will pass on our best wishes to Commissioner Dimas."
"I am sorry he is not here for the final session."
"We would have liked to thank him for the excellent work he has done over many years, and I hope we will see him next week in the Environment Committee to pass on our thanks."
