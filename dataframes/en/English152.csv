"The evaluation committee also invited Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, fearing migration flows from Turkey."
"This entire context of pressure exerted on these countries, as well as the objectives of this pressure, are the reason for our abstention."
"Moreover, we believe the considerations defining our position as regards expansion and the accession of new countries to the EU to be equally valid as regards the full application of the provisions of Schengen in these or other countries."
"The rapporteur considers all the conditions for abolishing border checks with Bulgaria and Romania to have been met, but wants the European Parliament to be kept informed about additional measures to be taken on the Bulgaria-Greece-Turkey border, which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration."
"Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the application of every part of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the EU Council of Ministers adopting a decision to abolish border checks at internal borders with these countries, after it has consulted the European Parliament."
"However, the evaluation committee invited Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, largely because they fear migration flows from Turkey."
"The decision to include these two countries, which joined the EU in 2007, in the Schengen area will have to be taken unanimously in the Council by all the governments of all the countries already belonging to Schengen."
"The subject should be debated at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 9 and 10 June."
"Given our position on the accession of these countries, we have maintained our position of abstention, reinforced by the pressure that continues to be exerted on these countries."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the EU in 2007."
"The basic condition for the Council to decide in favour of abolishing checks on internal borders with these Member States is to confirm, within the framework of the assessment procedures, whether the new Member States have fulfilled the necessary condition of applying all parts of the Schengen acquis: data protection, the Schengen Information System (SIS), air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas."
"In order that the European Parliament can clearly assess all the elements necessary for reaching an opinion on whether these two countries are ready to join the Schengen area, it is essential to have full access to the expert assessment reports on progress in the preparations of these two countries."
"In my opinion, however, Romania and Bulgaria have now proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner."
"At the same time, though, the situation must not be underestimated, and we must now think how to keep the situation under control following the full accession of these countries to Schengen."
"I have nothing against our friends and neighbours in Bulgaria and Romania."
"However, I do have a number of grievances against the Schengen provisions."
"This appalling agreement was concluded on the sly and ratified one August back in the 1980s."
"It has brought nothing but trouble."
"Removing internal borders does not guarantee freedom of movement for European citizens; rather, it creates insecurity and produces unmanageable population and migration trends within the EU, both in the countries of origin and of destination."
"It also provides wonderful opportunities for illegal immigrants, who know that no matter where they enter Europe, they will be able to settle wherever they like: France is particularly hard hit."
"The problems of the Roma and Lampedusa that have often been cited in this House merely serve to illustrate the problem."
"I do not want Schengen to apply in my country, nor would I wish it on others."
"Member States should retain full control of their borders and, where applicable, work together to strengthen the 'external' borders."
"I fully supported the adoption of this report which approves Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area."
"Both States have worked hard to beef up border controls and have been successful, as confirmed by the positive findings of the evaluations and expert visits organised by the Council's Schengen Evaluation Working Group."
"Both countries have met all the technical criteria laid down by the European Union."
"Consequently I fully support their full participation in the Schengen area."
"Member States cannot add new conditions (such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime) or change the rules at half-time."
"This week marks the 26th anniversary of the Schengen Agreement, one of the EU's greatest achievements, which must be defended, as must freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right for European Union citizens."
"I am in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area."
"A detailed and objective assessment of both countries' compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed."
"Both countries have met all the criteria."
"It is therefore unreasonable to add other conditions such as an assessment of policies on combating corruption and crime."
"These issues are undoubtedly important, but the proposal is purely politically motivated."
"Adding new criteria would create a two-tier system for Member States."
"This vision of a two-speed Europe, with different rules for old and new Member States, is quite simply unacceptable."
"The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU."
"Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further."
"There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system."
"Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area."
"For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the EU in 2007."
"According to the Act of Accession, verification, by means of evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis (data protection, the SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas) have been met by the new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States."
"I did not endorse this document because taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the committee responsible has concluded that there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future."
"It should be taken into account that the area made up by Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece is one the most sensitive points in the EU's external borders in terms of illegal migration."
"It is therefore essential for Bulgaria to adopt some additional measures, namely, to prepare a special plan containing actions to be implemented at the moment of entering Schengen and also a joint approach (between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria) in order to be able to respond to the possible increase in migration flows."
"I feel that the Member States concerned should be requested to inform the European Parliament and the Council, in writing in the course of a six-month period, beginning on the date of the entry into force of this decision, on the implementation of these additional measures and shortcomings."
"I voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania."
"Indeed, Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when joining the European Union in 2007."
"According to Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, verifying that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States."
"The assessments carried out show that both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner."
"I therefore support the rapporteur's request."
"However, we cannot forget that the area in question is one of the most sensitive parts of the EU's external borders in terms of illegal migration."
"This means that additional measures need to be adopted because, as we know, the abolition of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Member States and also the existence of effective controls on external borders, since the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency with which each Member State carries out its external border checks."
"Today in the European Parliament, we voted on the Coelho report on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania."
"It is worth noting that the end of preparations for these countries to join the Schengen area coincides with the debate on the EU migration policy and the growing opposition of some of the countries in the Schengen area to plans for its expansion."
"It is worth emphasising the fact that Romania and Bulgaria have met almost all the requirements imposed upon them, in particular: land, air and sea border checks, the issuing of visas, police cooperation and data protection."
"We must also not forget that these are EU border countries, which are contending with the problem of an influx of illegal immigrants."
"Sofia and Bucharest are jointly applying for membership, and the current state of preparations in both countries has been rated highly, so I voted in favour of adopting the report."
"I naturally voted for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"Like all Romanian and European citizens, I want the reforms to the justice system in my country to continue, the level of corruption and fraud to be reduced, cases to be judged justly and more quickly, and the guilty to be punished harshly."
"We joined the European Union because we wanted to adopt its internal rules."
"I feel it is normal for us to abide by them and to keep the promises which we made on joining."
"I thank the Union and Member States which are helping us carry out permanent reforms to the justice system and implement anti-corruption measures because this is also what Romanian citizens want."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the basis of expert reports which say that at this moment, both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner."
"Bulgaria and Romania satisfy the requirements for full integration into the Schengen area, based on their evaluation reports and the reports by the expert monitoring teams."
"However, the European Parliament should be informed about the additional measures to be taken in the area between Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece in order to address a possible increase in immigration flows."
"Bulgaria and Romania have completed all the work demanded by Fortress Europe in order for their citizens to be able to move freely within the Schengen area."
"This report asks for even more."
"It calls for a joint approach in conjunction with Greece to tackle migration from Arab countries."
"This demand is unacceptable."
"I am abstaining so as not to vote against freedom of movement within the Union."
"Bulgaria and Romania have been subjected to the evaluation of the proper application of all parts of the Schengen acquis: control of the land, sea and air borders, police cooperation, visas, connection to the Schengen Information System (SIS), and data protection."
"This is a precondition for the EU Council of Ministers in deciding to abolish checks at internal borders with those Member States, following consultation with the European Parliament."
"Following the positive results of the evaluations and follow-up visits by teams of experts, it can be concluded that although some issues remain outstanding and regular reports and future follow-up visits are being demanded, these do not constitute an obstacle to the full accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area."
"We cannot, however, neglect the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece region, which is one of the EU's most sensitive external borders in terms of illegal immigration."
"There is a need to strengthen the measures already taken and to be prepared to combat a possible sharp increase in migration pressure."
"Bulgaria should adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area."
"The right to freedom of movement is one of the most fundamental and most visible rights conferred on citizens of the Union."
"Within the Schengen area, it is now possible to move freely without border controls."
"What a change in comparison to the era when Europe was scattered with border posts where checks - nit-picking ones at times - were the norm, not to mention the impossibility for citizens in the East to cross the iron curtain without risking their lives!"
"Currently, this space comprises 25 participating States."
"Romania and Bulgaria should join this circle soon - at least that is my hope."
"These two countries have adopted the Schengen acquis since their accession to the European Union in 2007."
"Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the visits carried out by teams of experts, I am completely in favour of full accession to the Schengen area for these two Member States, even though certain problems are still to be resolved and will require follow-up."
"I would add, however, that it would be unfortunate if new conditions, which were unknown at the time of the request and evaluation, were imposed along the way."
"in writing. - It seems that Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are, to a sufficient extent, ready to fulfil the Schengen acquis."
"There are many unresolved issues in the report on the expansion of the Schengen area prepared by Carlos Coelho."
"From the assumptions of reports of evaluation missions and results of repeated evaluation visits, I came to the conclusion that there are separate areas which require constant monitoring."
"The report, which has not been adopted yet, is the conclusion of a repeated visit by the evaluation mission regarding the external border of Bulgaria."
"Therefore, it is clear that the triangle Bulgaria-Romania-Greece is one of the most sensitive regions from the point of view of illegal migration and that requires Bulgaria to prepare additional measures to resist migration pressure."
"I think that the report should be accepted. I voted in favour."
"I voted for the Coelho report on applying the Schengen acquis in Romania and Bulgaria and I welcome the realistic attitude and good faith shown by all my fellow Members who also voted for this report."
"Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled the technical conditions for joining the Schengen area and this must be the only factor to be considered in adopting this decision."
"Romania and Bulgaria have proven their ability to adopt the necessary domestic legislation and make their borders secure."
"Furthermore, great strides have been made in the fight against corruption, a topic which often has been associated wrongfully and, to an exaggerated extent, with accession to the Schengen area."
"Today, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the application of all the provisions of the Schengen acquis to Bulgaria and Romania."
"These countries, which joined the European Union in 2007, adopted only some of the provisions concerning the Schengen area, and have applied them within this limited scope ever since."
"The upshot of this situation is that border checks are still carried out along the borders of these countries."
"When they joined the EU, these countries were not ready to adopt the Schengen package in its entirety, and have therefore had to reform and extend their policies on border checks."
"In addition, the section of the border between Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, which is one of the EU's most vulnerable external borders in terms of illegal emigration, poses an extremely significant problem."
"Since joining the EU, Bulgaria and Romania have taken numerous measures aimed at properly preparing and protecting their borders."
"During this entire period, the Schengen Evaluation Working Party has carried out systematic inspections and checks, which have now shown that both countries are sufficiently well prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis satisfactorily."
"The abolition of internal border control is particularly important for the entire European Union and each Member State individually."
"In order for the Schengen area to be able to function effectively and for the goals set to be achieved, it is necessary to ensure that the abolition of border control does not have negative consequences, particularly as regards illegal migration."
"Every country aiming to join the Schengen area must meet, without exception, all of the conditions of the Schengen acquis concerning data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders in the air, on land and at sea, police cooperation and visas."
"Moreover, it is very important to ensure that every Member State has strict and effective external border controls."
"I believe that Romania and Bulgaria will soon be able to become real members, capable of applying all of the provisions of the Schengen acquis."
"At the moment, particular attention should be paid to Bulgaria, because this country, like Turkey and Greece, lies on the EU's external borders."
"It is the most sensitive and fragile place in the Union."
"When they become full members of the Schengen area, it is therefore crucial for Bulgaria and Romania to be properly prepared to manage increased migration flows, to be able to implement measures to combat illegal migration appropriately and effectively, and to guarantee well-functioning external border control mechanisms."
"I voted in favour of admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area."
"Following careful examination, the EU committee responsible recognised that these countries have fulfilled all the criteria for membership of the Schengen area: they offer sufficient assurances as regards the protection of national borders on land, at sea and in the air and they have mastered the Schengen Information System for data exchange and reliably ensure data protection."
"My group considers the introduction of new criteria for membership at this point to be wrong because this would mean applying double standards for these countries."
"The difficulties that Romania and Bulgaria still face - organised crime and corruption - are, undoubtedly, serious accusations against the governments of these countries, which should combat these phenomena more effectively."
"However, in my opinion, closing Schengen's gates to Romania and Bulgaria should not penalise honest citizens, who would suffer the most if they now lost the opportunity to travel freely throughout Europe."
"In the context of the free movement of European citizens within the European Union, I think Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen acquis is an excellent step forward and I therefore voted in favour of the relevant provisions being implemented."
"I also believe that even though both countries have worked hard for the free movement of their citizens within Europe, they should, in any case, continue to bring their controls and rules into line with European standards, given the sensitive nature of the eastern European borders in the Balkans."
"I voted today in favour of the opinion of the European Parliament on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania."
"This is a balanced approach, as the opinion recognises the progress made by these two countries in terms of the criteria which must be satisfied for integration into the Schengen area (control of land, sea and air borders, visas, police cooperation, readiness in terms of connecting to and using the Schengen Information System and data protection), but also requires regular progress reports on certain issues which are considered to be outstanding."
"Thus, Parliament has given the go-ahead for the integration of these two countries into the Schengen area and equal rights for their citizens, who have not enjoyed the right to move freely in the past."
"We trust that the European Parliament's message will act as a guide and that unanimity will be achieved in the Council so that a final decision can be taken."
"I would congratulate my colleague, Mr Coelho, on his excellent work on the report on the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the European Union in 2007."
"The report says that compliance with the necessary conditions for application of the acquis in question - data protection, the Schengen Information System (SIS), air borders, land borders, sea borders, political cooperation and visas - was evaluated on the ground, and progress in the implementation of measures aiming for the abolition of checks at the internal borders with these Member States was confirmed in situ."
"According to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs who have been monitoring this process, the outstanding issues, which will require regular reports and monitoring in the future, do not constitute an obstacle to these two Member States' full accession to the Schengen area."
"For these reasons, I support the decision to open the borders to these Member States."
"I am voting for this report and welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the 'Schengen area'."
"This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process."
"The accession of a new State is conditional on strict compliance with the criteria of the Schengen Agreement."
"In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties - like the European Commission - has concluded after evaluation that these two States meet the conditions laid down in full."
"Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement."
"I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it."
"The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate."
"Therefore, I solemnly call upon the Council to acknowledge the improvements made by Bulgaria and Romania and admit them into the Schengen area."
"Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by the expert teams, it is evident that Romania is now in a position to implement the Schengen acquis fully, all the points meriting attention or reviewing have been remedied (improvement of risk assessment, upgrade of the security features of the buildings, improvement of the process for submitting and processing visa applications and so on) and, in some aspects, it could be considered as a model of best practice."
"According to the evaluation reports, Romania has shown that it is sufficiently prepared to apply both the non-SIS related provisions of the Schengen acquis, as well as its SIS-related provisions, in a satisfactory manner."
"The preconditions have been fulfilled for the Council to take the decision referred to in Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, allowing for the lifting of internal controls at air, land and sea borders."
"This means that the removal of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Members States regarding the existence of effective external border controls because the security of the Schengen area depends on how rigorously and effectively each Member State controls its external borders."
"I voted for this report because the full application of the Schengen agreement in Bulgaria and Romania certainly means the abolition of border checks for these countries as well."
"At a time when some governments are daring to suggest the reestablishment of checks at internal borders, it is even more important to demonstrate our support for the extension of what is, today, one of the European Union's best achievements."
"Full application in these Member States is also a question of equality and non-discrimination within Europe because excluding those two countries would send an extremely negative signal to their populations, which are very keen to join the area of freedom of movement."
"For these reasons, it is important to give this stage broad support."
"The Balkan region is one of the most sensitive areas of the EU's external borders in terms of illegal migration."
"This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face."
"Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures."
"In addition, improving controls at external borders must be combined with fighting the corruption of local authorities."
"I voted against this measure for the reasons stated and to better protect our citizens against illegal immigration."
"Accession to the Schengen acquis involves the need to comply with various evaluation procedures: candidate countries have to comply with a range of conditions in order to be admitted to the area of freedom of movement, which currently covers 25 countries and 400 million Europeans."
"This report evaluates the positions of Bulgaria and Romania, stressing, on the one hand, that Bulgaria follows best practices in various activities and, on the other, the efforts made by Romania as regards the shortcomings that were being detected."
"In conclusion, while I would stress the need to resolve a number of issues, the evaluation of these two Member States' behaviour is positive overall."
"The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU."
"Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further."
"There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system."
"Accordingly, this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area."
"For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately."
"in writing. - We support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania provided that all preconditions are met (as is the case, according to the experts' opinion)."
"According to Article 4(2) of Romania and Bulgaria's Act of Accession to the Schengen acquis, the precondition for the abolition of checks at internal borders with those countries is verification that the Schengen requirements are being met."
"Since both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner, both Member States should become fully-fledged members of the area."
"I would underline, however, the importance of rigorous controls at external borders for the purposes of internal security."
"As it is located in a sensitive area in terms of illegal migration, Bulgaria should adopt additional measures to respond to a possible increase in migratory pressure at its borders."
"The Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive parts of the European Union's external borders in terms of illegal migration."
"I disagree with the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, in that the admission of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the Schengen area cannot be completed in the short term because of the deficiencies in the fields of equipment, performance of border checks, training of personnel and the obligation to exchange information."
"Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they acceded to the EU in 2007."
"The integration of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area is acceptable, provided that they satisfy certain technical requirements noted in the relevant procedure."
"As the rapporteur quite rightly points out, the accession of Bulgaria to the Schengen Agreement should be followed by a special plan to combat illegal immigration."
"Cooperation is needed on the question of land border management."
"In 2010, 47 000 immigrants were arrested crossing the Greco-Turkish border, passing to the Greek side of the River Evros, which marks the border between Greece and Turkey."
"This number accounts for 90% of the total in Europe for that year."
"Within this framework, I welcome the rapporteur's proposal for a special plan to be prepared as soon as Bulgaria joins the Schengen area, containing actions in this direction and a joint approach between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria, so that it is in a position to cope with what may be a large increase in immigration flows."
"I voted against Bulgaria and Romania becoming full members of the Schengen cooperation at this point in time."
"The issue concerning Bulgaria giving its military police access to information from Schengen records demonstrates that there are problems with those parts of Schengen that these countries are already included in."
"There are also problems with corruption and organised crime."
"Europol points out that the full admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen cooperation will give criminal groups from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union easier access to the EU."
"Until these problems are resolved, full admission of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen will bolster cross-border corruption and crime whilst, at the same time, giving certain forces the opportunity they were waiting for to demand increased monitoring and undermining of the rule of law."
"At a time when more and more people are talking about a crisis of trust in the European Union, the fact that the overwhelming majority of MEPs support the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should be seen as confirmation that the idea of European integration still continues to be relevant."
"The fact that Bulgaria and Romania have external EU borders should not be regarded as a barrier preventing them from joining the Schengen area."
"Criteria for joining the area were established with the aim of ensuring the highest possible level of security."
"Experts have confirmed that the appropriate technical standards have been put in place."
"The countries have met the requirements imposed on them to an extent which makes it possible to abolish border checks with the remaining EU Member States."
"It should be emphasised that, as was the case for my country, joining the Schengen area does not mean that Romania and Bulgaria no longer have any work left to do as regards full implementation of the cooperation instrument."
"Both countries will have much work ahead of them in order to establish good working practices."
"The example of Poland shows clearly that the new Member States are able to meet the Schengen requirements effectively."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have the chance to implement the next stage of the political project known as the area of freedom, security and justice, provided appropriate monitoring is carried out by the European institutions."
"The European Parliament should play a key role in this process, and it must be kept up-to-date with the situation in Bulgaria and Romania."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which proposes to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the Schengen Information System to Bulgaria and Romania."
"I am also pleased that the report contains safeguards for data protection."
"Today, Parliament has adopted the report produced by Mr Coelho on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania."
"This report follows on from the evaluations carried out under the auspices of the Council's Schengen Evaluation Working Group."
"The evaluations have not found any obstacles to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area."
"Opening the borders has been one of the European Union's greatest achievements."
"I am therefore delighted that Parliament has voted in favour of these two new States joining the Schengen area."
"The Council now needs to be realistic and show solidarity by giving its unanimous approval."
"The creation of the Schengen area dates from 1985 and currently includes a territory of 42 673 km of external sea borders and 7 721 km of land borders, taking in 400 million Europeans."
"The Schengen Agreement currently covers 25 Member States with a common area for the free movement of people, by removing systematic checks at internal borders and creating a single common border."
"In order to fully realise this agreement, common rules were established - regarding, inter alia, checks along the entire external border, common visa policy, police and judicial cooperation - and the Schengen Information System (SIS) was created."
"This report concerns the entry of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen acquis and, following the evaluation visits and a final report, it concludes that both countries are ready for full accession."
"However, some issues remain outstanding, in particular, the need to establish a plan to combat possible pressure from illegal migration."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur that there is a need for the Member States in question to inform Parliament and the Council within a six-month period, beginning on the date of entry into force of this decision, on the implementation of these additional measures and progress with the shortcomings identified."
"The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU."
"Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further."
"There is no denying that technically securing borders will not automatically make them secure as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system."
"However, this challenge also concerns Member States already in the Schengen area."
"For this reason, the German Free Democratic Party delegation believes that criteria such as the fight against corruption must receive greater attention when evaluating the Schengen mechanism, and any misdemeanours must be punished appropriately."
"In 2007, when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, they adopted the Schengen acquis."
"According to Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, 'the verification, through evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis (data protection, the SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas) have been met by the new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States'."
"According to the evaluation reports compiled by experts, both Romania and Bulgaria have shown that they are prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner."
"This is why we call on the Council to approve the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area."
"The Union must apply the same criteria to all Member States, including when it comes to joining the Schengen area."
"The Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for the justice system does not feature among the criteria for joining the Schengen area and cannot be referred to in connection with Romania and Bulgaria joining the area."
"Since Romania and Bulgaria fulfil the technical conditions for joining the Schengen area, on behalf of the citizens of Romania, Bulgaria and Europe, we call on the Council to approve the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the area."
"Bulgaria and Romania should join the Schengen area, since both countries are ready to do so and the objections of certain Member States are unfounded."
"I voted in favour of the report on the integration of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area because both countries have met the technical criteria in question."
"However, additional measures should be taken by Bulgaria, in cooperation with Greece and Turkey, to address the problem of illegal immigration."
"in writing. - As a friend, albeit critical friend, of Bulgaria, I wish to do all I can to assist progress in that country, but not at the expense of my own country's well-being."
"I therefore abstained in the vote."
"On the accession of Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007, weaknesses remained in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"The Bulgarian authorities undertook to bring about radical improvement."
"The EU established a 'Cooperation and Verification Mechanism' to assist Bulgaria and to verify progress against six benchmarks."
"Improvement has been disappointingly slow."
"In its most recent report on these matters (February 2011), the Commission stated that Bulgaria needed to improve further the way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are structured, managed and cooperate."
"Nevertheless, the 27 governments in Council concluded, perhaps surprisingly, that Bulgaria fulfilled the conditions for Schengen, a system which is itself under question at the moment."
"The UK, of course, remains outside the Schengen area."
"I welcome the majority of over 80% received in the European Parliament during the vote in favour of adopting the report on the fulfilment of the Schengen acquis by Romania and Bulgaria."
"This vote sends out a powerful political signal."
"In the European Parliament's view, Romania and Bulgaria are ready to join the Schengen area."
"According to the position of the UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania), Romania and Bulgaria must receive a definite prospect in 2011 of joining this area of free movement."
"I do not think that the rules should be changed during the game, and the decision on joining the Schengen area must take into account what has been achieved under the Schengen Agreement and not be based on political assessments."
"The situation which has been created over the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area highlights how weak the sense of solidarity is within the EU."
"The fact that there are Member States prepared to give up one of the basic freedoms of European integration, the freedom of movement, sounds an alarm bell."
"At the same time, this is a mistaken response to the tensions caused by the economic crisis and to its social consequences."
"The UDMR believes that we need a strong Europe, which can be achieved through greater solidarity and by firmly rejecting internal protectionism and populism."
"Despite having a few doubts about the excessive reach of the text - which falls within the ambit of the Europe 2020 strategy - I think the objectives of the resolution are most welcome."
"I therefore voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on verifying the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis, which is a prerequisite for the abolition of internal border controls with Bulgaria and Romania."
"This report will be adopted despite the controversy in the working party of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the amendment raising the nuclear issue, and the amendment of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) removing the issue of additional permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council."
"There needs to be a substantial change in the international order so that the EU can better overcome its challenges using concerted global action."
"I would also draw attention to the fact that, according to Article 21 of the Treaty, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism and to the role of the UN in particular."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, not only because of the importance of the upcoming 66th session of the UN General Assembly, but also because it is vitally important that the EU finally steps up cooperation and coordination in this and all other UN bodies."
"Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union clearly stipulates that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and that Member States, which are also members of the UN Security Council, will concert and, in the execution of their functions, defend the positions and the interests of the Union."
"So far, cooperation was not exemplary in the UN General Assembly."
"Neither was it in the UN Security Council."
"We all know well that Member States that belong to the UN Security Council (France, the United Kingdom and Germany) failed to act in concert and come up with a single position vis-à-vis military intervention in Libya, in particular, with regard to the vote on the UN Security Council Resolution 1973."
"I would therefore urge EU Member States to strive for a common position on issues vital to international peace and security, especially in areas where there is already a broad international consensus."
"In a rapidly changing world, the European Union is faced with numerous challenges requiring a concerted global response."
"All these major transformations are making the European Union commit itself actively, alongside the other partners, to promoting effective solutions to the problems affecting both European citizens and the whole of humanity."
"The European Union is the world's biggest provider of development aid and the United Nations' main partner in supporting the latter's efforts in carrying out its activities."
"The European Union must play a proactive role in creating a United Nations Organisation which makes an effective contribution to global solutions, peace and security, as well as democracy and international order, based on the rule of law."
"According to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism, which has a powerful UN organisation as its focal point, making a vital contribution to tackling the global challenges."
"We are currently witnessing radical changes in the international order; changes to which the European Union can no longer be a mere spectator."
"I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy."
"In the same vein, I agree with the need expressed in Mr Lambsdorff's proposal for the Member States to exert pressure during discussions to reform the United Nations Security Council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the European Union."
"By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs."
"Otherwise, we shall have to keep facing up to the continuous lack of coordination of Member States' interests on the international scene."
"in writing. - I strongly supported the main thrust of this report."
"It calls for an enhanced role for the EU in the UN system, taking into account the institutional changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty."
"Today's vote comes after a relevant success for the EU in the UN: the adoption of a set of modalities granting the EU delegation in the UN General Assembly the right to make interventions, as well as the right of reply and the ability to present oral proposals and amendments."
"These improvements reflect a clear reality: The EU and its Member States are the biggest financial contributors to the UN system, with EU funds amounting to 38% of the UN regular budget, more than two fifths of UN peacekeeping operations and close to half of the contributions to the UN funds and programmes."
"Moreover, the EU, in spite of all its limitations, is a major global actor whose weight must be properly recognised at every level."
"I supported the report by Alexander Graf Lambsdorff because I think that we need to foster greater cohesion between the Member States' positions and enhance our ability to negotiate with other regional groups."
"It is a question, then, of improving the efficiency and transparency of the United Nations and enhancing the management of its financial resources."
"I am certain that reforming the working methods and composition of the United Nations Security Council is necessary in the medium term."
"A major transformation of the world order is taking place, challenging the European Union to engage more actively with current and emerging world powers and with other bilateral and multilateral partners, in order to promote effective solutions to problems which affect both EU citizens and the world at large."
"In accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism with a strong UN at its core, which is essential in order to address global challenges, such as climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change and migration, and international organised crime."
"I agree that the EU should play a proactive part in building a United Nations that can effectively contribute to global solutions, peace and security, democracy and a world order based on the principles of the rule of law."
"I voted for the report drafted by Mr Lambsdorff because I think that the EU is creating a new identity for itself on the global stage at the moment."
"I should remind you of the lengthy period of cooperation between the two international organisations, as well as of the EU's involvement in numerous projects launched by the UN."
"I must mention at this point the commitment made by European leaders to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"The eradication of poverty globally now features among the Union's foreign policy priorities."
"I welcome the initiative for strengthening cooperation on bringing stability to crisis zones and on drawing up new safety standards for nuclear power plants."
"The course of events in Japan highlights the need for this partnership."
"In view of the social upheaval in the Mediterranean region, I think that coordinated action between the EU and UN would ensure a peaceful transition to democracy."
"In this regard, I welcome improving relations with regional organisations."
"I am in favour of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the next session of the United Nations General Assembly."
"The proposal underlines that the European Union and the United Nations share the common commitment to promoting democracy, respect for human rights and peace among the international community."
"The proposal states that the further enlargement of the United Nations Security Council in order to include the EU is a key factor for effectively pursuing the objectives mentioned above."
"The proposal rejects Germany's request to occupy the potential new EU seat at the United Nations on a permanent basis and instead incorporates the Italian proposal to allow all Member States to occupy the seat in rotation in order to respect the principle of the equal dignity of all Member States."
"The German request had been seen as an attempt to impose the political authority of Germany and the Anglo-French-German bloc within and outwith the EU."
"However, the adoption of the Italian position through this proposal confirms that the possible enlargement of the Security Council would also assure Italy the chance of having its voice heard on crucial international issues outside the EU."
"I have therefore voted in favour."
"in writing. - It is important that Europe reaffirms its commitment to, and cooperation with, international movements like the UN at this time."
"The attention that the European Parliament gives the UN is most important."
"The times we live in make it clear that there is a need to link up the Member States and the European Union in the most diverse situations and instances."
"This coordination is also very important in the United Nations (UN)."
"I would even say it is essential to ensure European interests and values are defended and safeguarded in what is the most comprehensive and decisive international organisation."
"Regardless of future changes to how the Union is represented within the UN, and in the Security Council - a debate which is still open - in particular, there is increasingly a need to join up the efforts of European countries so as to, alongside the Union's representatives overseas, encourage a collective capacity for intervention and influence."
"Regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and those of the EU will be an important step along this path."
"At the same time, the Union should contribute to making the UN more efficient and transparent, and improve the management of its financial resources."
"The creation of a United Nations parliamentary assembly within the framework of the United Nations system is an interesting proposal that is worth studying and debating."
"This report by Mr Lambsdorff concerns a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the 66th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly."
"The transformation of the present international order at global level through conflicts in various parts of the world, and the self-determination of many peoples that have been downtrodden for decades, or even centuries, make the upcoming session of the UN General Assembly unusually significant."
"Pursuant to Articles 21 and 41 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament could not fail to take advantage of this session to push its positions on a number of subjects: not least, the role of the EU in the UN system; the EU and global governance; peace, security and justice; development; human rights; and climate change."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposals mentioned above, as well as with the need to foster a debate on the role of parliaments and national assemblies in the UN system, and on creating a UN parliamentary assembly."
"The report advocates giving the European Union a seat on the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council."
"A number of voices have been heard advocating this idea in recent times, supported by the amendments introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, specifically, the attribution of 'legal personality' to the EU."
"These are amendments whose legitimacy we have always contested."
"This demand - which subverts the spirit of the organisation: an organisation of states and not of supranational organisations - is not being made with the intention of making the UN's workings more democratic or of creating a new world order that is fairer and more peaceful."
"The EU's alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States to undertake wars and carry out acts of aggression in countries like Libya is proof of this."
"It is fundamental principles of the UN Charter, such as non-intervention in states' internal affairs, respect for their sovereignty and independence, and recognition of their right to development, that the EU has been placing at risk."
"Sovereignty comes from the people and the peoples of Europe have not given it to this EU, which is increasingly anti-social and anti-democratic."
"This report again makes the unacceptable demand that the European Union have a seat at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council, as a result of the anti-democratic Treaty of Lisbon and the 'legal personality' acquired from it."
"It is not with the intention of making the workings of either the UN body more democratic, or of creating a new, fairer world order, that the majority in the European Parliament is doing this."
"How can an EU which, in alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States, is promoting a war, and violating international law and the UN Charter in Libya, contribute to making the UN more democratic, or to humanity's peace and progress?"
"How can the EU contribute to non-intervention in states' internal affairs, and respect their sovereignty and independence, and their right to development - rights enshrined in the UN Charter and in international law - when, in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is imposing an unprecedented programme of aggression against the workers and people of Portugal, and of the usurping of their resources?"
"It cannot."
"Sovereignty comes from the people and the peoples of Europe have not given it to an EU that is increasingly anti-social and anti-democratic."
"The European Union should play an active role in developing the UN so that it can contribute effectively to global solutions, peace, security, democracy and international order based on the rule of law."
"There is a need to support multilateralism as a primary strategic interest of the EU, and to strengthen cohesion and the visibility of the EU as a global player within the UN."
"The ongoing transformation of the international order presents the EU with a challenge to focus more actively on current and emergent global powers and other bilateral and multilateral partnerships, in order to support effective solutions to the problems affecting EU citizens and the whole world in general."
"The document under discussion sets out the European Union's priorities to take to the United Nations General Assembly."
"The key point, which has now been under discussion for some time, is the debate about reforming the Security Council."
"The proposal for a European Union seat that may be rotated between the Member States seems like an excellent idea."
"I therefore support the report."
"I endorsed the document because it advocates advancing effective multilateralism as the overriding strategic concern of the Union and strengthening the coherence and visibility of the EU as a global actor at the UN, inter alia, by better coordinating internal EU consultations on UN issues and by promoting greater outreach on a wide range of issues."
"It also promotes engaging with the EU's strategic partners within the UN system and giving the strategic partnerships a multilateral dimension by including global issues on the agendas for the EU's bilateral and multilateral summits, as well as contributing to improving the efficiency and transparency of the UN and enhancing the management of the UN's financial resources."
"Furthermore, it touches on important issues, such as strengthening the role of the International Criminal Court and the international criminal justice system, promoting accountability, putting an end to impunity, and strengthening the crisis-prevention structures and their effectiveness within the United Nations Development Programme, with a view to transforming this organisation into a global leader in crisis prevention and recovery."
"It also stresses the need for close cooperation between the EU and the UN in the area of civilian and military crisis management, particularly in humanitarian relief operations, and the need to thoroughly reform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), by bringing to an end its dual function of both monitoring and promoting nuclear energy use, and to limit the IAEA's responsibilities to overseeing the nuclear energy industry and verifying compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as other important issues, which I basically agree with and support."
"In the run-up to the 66th ordinary session of the UN General Assembly, the European Parliament, as usual, addressed its recommendations to the Council, representing the Member States, who are the only fully fledged members of the organisation."
"However, this year, the Union will be able to take advantage of its new 'super-observer' status, which confers special rights to speak during sessions."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it is commensurate with the Union's new ambitions at international level."
"The Treaty of Lisbon grants the EU new prerogatives, confirms the development of its international capacity and puts new tools in place."
"Following this act, the Union must use this new ambition in the service of effective multilateralism, with the full strength of its values at the core."
"It also calls for a strengthening of global governance at a time when global challenges require global solutions."
"Finally, it focuses on core themes that the Union must play a role in advancing, as is its custom: development, human rights and climate change."
"The current change in the international order is pushing the European Union to make a more active effort in its dealings with world and emerging powers so that it can take a proactive role in building a United Nations that can make an effective contribution to global solutions: peace, security, democracy and an international order based on the rule of law."
"This represents an essential starting point for dealing with climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change, migration and international organised crime."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have permanent structures for external representation."
"This allows us to take an international role in line with our pre-eminent economic status and to act as a global player capable of sharing the responsibility for security around the world."
"It is down to us to clearly identify our interests and strategic objectives in order to be able to act effectively."
"The European Union is the world's largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in crisis and post-crisis situations."
"We therefore feel duty bound to promote effective multilateralism as the overriding strategic concern of the Union and to strengthen the consistency and visibility of the EU as a global player."
"The EU cannot forget its role in every respect as a leading actor on the world stage."
"As such, it needs to increase its role in all the multilateral organisations and, in particular, the United Nations (UN), where its role must be increasingly active following the launch of the European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"Given that global partnerships are instrumental in achieving jointly identified global goals; that the EU is the world's largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in its efforts across all three pillars of its work, including in crisis and post-crisis situations; and that Member States' contribution amounts to 38% of the UN's regular budget, we believe a solid and stable EU-UN partnership is fundamental to the work of the UN and key to the EU's role as a global player."
"in writing. - In keeping with past practice, the Committee on Foreign Affairs draws up Parliament recommendations to the Council for the session of the United Nations General Assembly."
"As I understand it, EP priorities are: an enhanced role for the EU in the UN system, taking into account the institutional changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty; a need for guidelines ensuring proper consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States in order to avoid discordance of EU voices as in the case of Libya; an adequate budget for UN Women; further strengthening of the role of the ICC; support for the UN Mediation Unit and a key role for the EEAS in this context; improvement of the relationship between the UN Peacebuilding Commission and the EU Peace-building Partnership; and finally, stronger EU leadership in the area of global climate governance."
"All the abovementioned issues are timely and I voted in favour."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal because it gives an extensive review of the current global issues in the EU and UN, pointing out the challenges and the opportunities that the EU is facing."
"It has also addressed solid and far-reaching suggestions for the EU in various areas on the international level, such as engaging with the EU's strategic partners within the UN system, ensuring the important role of the EEAS, enhancing peace, security and justice, and combating climate change."
"I believe that these are the issues that are critical on the global stage right now, and the EU has to involve itself and play a vital role in all these aspects."
"Therefore, I support this proposal and recommend to the Council that it should give careful consideration to this report."
"I voted for this report because I agree with the recommendations being made to the Council in view of the 66th Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly."
"I agree that the UN's role should be strengthened."
"In fact, and as the rapporteur mentions, the European Union carries insufficient weight in UN bodies, taking into account the major contributions made by the EU and its Member States."
"The Council needs to make its positions heard more vigorously in the UN, whilst ensuring greater coordination in achieving the Union's goals there and fostering greater cohesion between the Member States' positions."
"I agree with the rapporteur's call for the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the President of the European Council to make achieving enhanced observer rights for the EU a strategic priority, and to show greater visibility at the UN by way of intensifying consultations with the governments of third-country UN Member States."
"in writing. - In favour."
"We recommend that the Council advances effective multilateralism as the overriding strategic concern of the Union and strengthens the coherence and visibility of the EU as a global actor at the UN, inter alia, by better coordinating internal EU consultation on UN issues and by promoting greater outreach on a wide range of issues."
"The Vice-President/High Representative (VP/HR) should be authorised to draft guidelines for regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and the EU ambassadors, especially between those working at a multilateral level in places like Geneva and New York, so that the EU can successfully pursue its UN agenda and meet the expectations of UN members regarding its ability to act."
"Greater cohesion should be fostered both within the UN system and between the positions of EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries, so as to maximise the potential offered by the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's impact through the coordinated and strategic use of its various and distinct (EU and Member State) entry points."
"Its ability to negotiate with other regional groups should be enhanced in a timely manner and the EU representatives provided with a proper mandate to negotiate effectively on behalf of the Member States."
"With regard to the 66th United Nations General Assembly, I support the view that Parliament ought to urge the Council to take a leading role in promoting the Millennium Development Goals."
"In fact, we must start a debate on how to sustain the international community's commitment to sustainable development and the elimination of poverty - which must also continue beyond 2015."
"Making progress on statebuilding, good and democratic government, conflict prevention, and the adoption of the required measures to combat corruption, tax evasion and the flight of capital, is an absolute priority."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Lambsdorff because I consider that the challenges facing the EU, in a fast-changing world, require coordinated action at global level."
"The EU has more and enhanced opportunities for external representation under the Treaty of Lisbon and cooperation with the UN and other international organisations is both desirable and necessary for the purpose of crisis management, to maintain and build peace and to respond to international challenges, such as recent developments in Japan."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on this report, I am delighted that it has been adopted today by the plenary of the European Parliament."
"It is essential to reaffirm the need to harmonise the efforts of different United Nations bodies in order to better promote the efficiency and effectiveness of action on development."
"Development assistance implemented by the United Nations must focus especially on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with particular attention to the Least Developed Countries."
"I am voting for this report, firstly because it criticises the Commission for delaying publication until 9 February 2011, even though it was obliged to table it in 2010, and because, like the rapporteur, I regret the weakness of the Commission communication as regards new developments."
"I also regret the lack of good results as regards small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I do, however, acknowledge that the joint technology initiatives help make European industry more competitive, although the already existing legal and administrative obstacles need to be dealt with quickly."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities."
"By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the European Commission on the future implementation of the Framework Programme for research."
"One of the most important proposals, which I also support, is the simplification of administrative requirements for projects implemented according to this programme."
"In fact, one of the difficulties noted is the complexity and burden of administrative procedures, as a result of which researchers seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing and Europe is made unpopular with regard to research."
"It is also very important for research and development policies to be territorialised so that research is distributed harmoniously in relation to all universities."
"The excellence often found in urban areas could be ensured by intensifying virtual links, for example, through permanent videoconferencing and a smart connection between territorialised research centres and centres of excellence."
"The Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities is the largest research support instrument in the world and the primary tool of European Union research policy."
"Research is the process of converting economic power into knowledge, while innovation is the reverse process of transforming knowledge into economic power."
"The European Union and its Member States must create for themselves the means to respond jointly to the major social, economic, environmental, demographic and ethical challenges facing Europe's states, such as an ageing population, citizens' health, food supply, sustainable development and the major environmental issues."
"A better relationship is essential between the academic, research and industrial worlds to enable research results to be converted more effectively into products and services, generating economic growth and benefits for society as a whole."
"Member States should also step up their communication efforts regarding the use of new technologies, such as smart research information services, by announcing forthcoming research challenges and distributing research findings."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report."
"Despite a series of hindrances - such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries - the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development."
"FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA)."
"Looking at Mr Audy's report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility."
"With a view to negotiating the future financial perspective from 2014, these measures will pave the way for the Europeanisation of research."
"The report by my colleague, Mr Audy, on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities (FP7) reveals a low level of participation by SMEs and industry in general, a low number of female researchers and under-representation of certain Member States."
"I think it is necessary to develop effective coordination of research between the EU and national and regional authorities."
"That is why I voted in favour of this excellent report."
"The Seventh Framework Programme, with a total budget of €54.6 billion, is the world's largest instrument for supporting research, and that programme is definitely at the heart of EU research policy."
"It must be reviewed and adapted to a changing world, however, particularly in light of the financial crisis and varying fiscal circumstances."
"Currently, Irish bodies receive about €1 million a week from EU research funds, and other opportunities remain for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs)."
"It is the SMEs that create 70% of the jobs in the euro area, and the SME sector is at the heart of the European economy."
"Therefore, transparency must be increased and the administrative burden reduced so that more SMEs would be interested in becoming involved in programmes in the future, to ensure the Union's effectiveness in relation to research, development and innovation."
"Time-to-grant must be reduced and European cooperation and coordination improved in order to tackle the fragmentation which is currently damaging to the programme."
"On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, set the European Union (EU) an ambitious strategic objective: to become, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"The central role played by research in this strategy has been acknowledged."
"Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy."
"Its aim is to enable the EU to respond to the great societal challenges that concern all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone (ageing population and health, energy and water supplies or food supplies, sustainable development, climate change, and so on), as well as to develop the knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness."
"In this report, the European Parliament is carrying out a mid-term review in order to ensure that FP7 meets the needs of European policies."
"I agree that in order to ensure that this programme is as effective as possible, it is necessary to simplify complicated and burdensome administrative procedures so as to successfully create a European Research Area."
"The EU's Seventh Framework Programme is a crucial programme for improving the European added value in terms of research, development and innovation, at a time when Europe is lagging behind the United States in these areas, and is losing the headway it had over the emerging economies."
"Therefore, this report serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme while calling for changes: to alter the overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the low rate of success that make this programme still too prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), at a time when they play an important role in turning research outcomes into products and services; to ensure better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders at a time when the funding of research still remains split between national and European sources."
"These are a few initiatives that could at last enable us to reach the goal of financing research and development set at 3% of GDP by 2020, which is far from being achieved, in particular for France, which still only devotes 2% of its GDP to R&D."
"In March 2000, the Council set the European Union the ambitious objective of becoming 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world' by 2010."
"The central role played by research in this strategy has been acknowledged."
"I think that examining the review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development offers an opportunity to cement the precious link between knowledge, education and research."
"Over the years, FP7 has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy."
"It also offers a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions by consolidating the European Research Area."
"In my view, there are two main aspects that the review should focus on in particular: overcoming the problems related to the burden and complexity of administrative procedures, as a result of which those seeking European financing are diverted towards national financing."
"Added to which, despite the progress made in recent years, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme should be stepped up in order to develop the skills that would allow them to boost their competitiveness."
"I voted for the resolution because the Europe 2020 programme considers research and innovation to be central for emerging from the crisis by means of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"For that to happen, the Seventh Framework Programme must increase its funding from 2013 onwards."
"The Member States must commit themselves to continuing with the programmes as there must be increased collaboration between technology platforms, universities and the industrial sector as well as further simplification of procedures to eliminate the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing the research and development programmes."
"The report by Mr Audy on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities certainly contains a number of pleasing aspects."
"For example, it looks at the fact that the programme has had a low success rate with small and medium-sized enterprises and also considers the request to shorten time-to-grant periods."
"However, I abstained in the vote because this own-initiative report contained a point which I thought was particularly weak, which made it impossible for me to vote in favour."
"Specifically, I do not support Mr Audy's call to increase funding for the European Research Council, as well as making it an independent legal entity with decision-making power which would be directly responsible for its own scientific strategy and administrative management."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that an appropriate mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities is particularly important for establishing whether the programme's implementation accords with the objectives set."
"This programme is one of the most important research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy."
"Furthermore, in many of the documents it has adopted recently, setting out its development goals and guidelines for the next decade, the European Union stresses the importance of research and innovation for strengthening the EU economy and helping it remain one of the most competitive in the world."
"In addition to the generally positive assessment, the report draws the Commission's attention to many aspects of the programme's implementation and provides specific proposals as to how they might be improved."
"For example, the report proposes increasing the programme's financing but, at the same time, it proposes identifying common research areas among those which appear most promising in terms of concrete applications, enabling the highest extent of sharing in an ethical context, so that tangible results are achieved when implementing this programme."
"Despite the fact that Europe is still behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the developing economies, the results of the Seventh Framework Programme demonstrate the added value of this European programme for research and development in Europe."
"Unfortunately, however, there is still no method for evaluating how far the projects funded by the Seventh Framework Programme have advanced scientific knowledge."
"It is also necessary to point out the considerable imbalance between the participation of entities from the old and new Member States."
"Equally, the level of involvement particularly of small and medium-sized enterprises remains relatively poor."
"The situation could be improved by simplifying the administrative and financial rules."
"It is necessary to emphasise the importance of the Joint Technological Initiatives (JTI) for the competitiveness of European industry."
"It is also necessary to point out the legal and administrative obstacles (legal subjectivity, funding rules and sometimes also intellectual property) which may dissuade many key research players and SMEs from participating."
"We must change the situation where the funding of research in Europe is too fragmented, while there are many sources of funding in the Member States and the EU applying different priorities, evaluation criteria, definitions and procedures, which necessarily leads to overlaps, confusion and errors."
"Given the still fragile economic situation resulting from the financial crisis that has rocked Europe, in his mid-term review, the rapporteur mentions important aspects that should be improved so as to use the available public funding as efficiently as possible."
"I agree with the emphasis given by the rapporteur to two issues that are very important for future European research: increased simplification of payments between the European Commission and other entities, and increased participation by small and medium-sized enterprises, and industry in general, in responding to the great social challenges."
"The unanimity of the committee vote on this important report and the vote taken today show, once again, that Parliament knows how to take a clear and decisive stance on crucial issues for citizens and enterprises."
"I think the report really highlights the critical aspects of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It also sets out valid proposals to ensure that the remaining funds to be allocated can make a real contribution to increasing competitiveness and quality in the European market."
"In my view, simplifying administrative procedures and cutting red tape is still the most important challenge if we really want to let our businesses - and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises - have access to funds."
"We must use these funds to improve our ability to work in an integrated way by improving public/private partnerships, incentivising inter-regional clusters and ensuring good coordination between cohesion funds and funds for research and innovation."
"This report helps to draw attention to the factors which are crucial in meeting the requirements of the future of research in Europe, in particular, in the context of the objectives assigned by the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It has now become essential to reduce excessive administrative burdens, in particular, to encourage greater participation by SMEs in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Furthermore, it is imperative that EU programmes consolidate at all times the advantages of research and innovation, for the benefit of education and job creation."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for research and development for the period 2007-2013 has been subject to a mid-term review by the European Parliament."
"This is an opportunity to remind the European Commission of the importance of making the right choices when investing in research and innovation for the future of Europe."
"EUR 28.5 billion remains to be programmed for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013."
"This sum must be allocated as a matter of priority to projects put forward by SMEs and industry in general, particularly in the areas of energy provision, sustainable development and the fight against climate change."
"We must ensure a better distribution of research infrastructure throughout the European Union, while respecting the principle of excellence which allows Europe to attract the best researchers in the world."
"In 2010, the EU had not met the Lisbon strategy target of spending 3% of its GDP on research and development."
"This goal was revived in the Europe 2020 strategy, but the EU must now find the means to meet that target in order to remain an internationally competitive economy."
"I welcome the adoption of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme, taking into account the impact of the recent economic crisis, which has particularly affected the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in research and development."
"In order to avoid red tape and facilitate companies' access to European funding, simpler and more transparent procedures are absolutely vital."
"With the publication of the Europe 2020 strategy, it became clear that commitment to research and development is crucial in order for Europe to return to economic growth and win the competitiveness game."
"That is why any evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities should be linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and its implementation."
"I am convinced that, through research and development, Europe can manage to find efficient and effective responses to the energy problem, to the challenges of climate change, and to improving European competitiveness and productivity, leading us to a new growth cycle that is more sustainable this time."
"This report by Mr Audy is on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities."
"On 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, set the European Union an objective: to become, by 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world."
"It has not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal."
"I hope that the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will be met, in particular, the EU's commitment to invest 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in research and development by 2020."
"Europe 2020 cannot wait for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF): it must start now."
"Therefore, this review is of crucial importance, since 50% of the funding for FP7 has still not been spent."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur, specifically as regards the recommendations regarding the need to simplify mechanisms for accessing funds, making procedures simpler and more transparent, and facilitating the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It should also invest in flagship areas like health, energy and nuclear safety, responding to the new challenges of innovation and research."
"The report introduces several important aspects of the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for research and technological development."
"It also makes relevant observations, such as that the majority of the EU's scientific work is still undertaken by researchers and technicians - mainly young people - in insecure jobs; the Portuguese case is paradigmatic."
"We believe that there is a need to support public research and make its results available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, by promoting: productive and business activity, and small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular; the creation of skilled jobs, with rights; social progress and sustainable development."
"There is a need for a commitment to areas as diverse as, inter alia, energy efficiency, new energy sources, efficient resource use, recycling and new productive processes."
"We cannot fail to express our concern about some of the principles guiding the European Research Area."
"We believe it should be founded on cooperation and mutual benefit, mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems, and reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries, which is the same as in so-called 'centres of excellence'."
"This report introduces several relevant aspects of the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development."
"Particularly important is its concern to ensure that 40% of those taking part in research are women, as this figure is currently no higher than 25.5%, and to recognise that 'Europe continues to lag behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the emerging economies'."
"The report also 'regrets that most of the scientific work carried out within the EU is still done under precarious working conditions'."
"However, we are concerned about some aspects, not least the principles guiding the European Research Area, since it should be focused on cooperation between genuine research and collaboration networks, reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries and mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems."
"Innovation in micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises requires support for public research and its results must be made available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, whether it be in terms of energy efficiency, using new sources of energy and new production processes, recycling and making better use of resources, or creating jobs with rights, or whether it be in human and social terms, with a view to social progress."
"The report assesses whether the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development will offer the possibility of consolidating the golden triangle of knowledge, education and research, which is of key importance for Europe."
"Among other things, the programme welcomes the level of participation and excellent results in the selection of projects, but it is a pity that the success rate in the programme generally remains relatively low."
"The correct management of public funds within the framework of this programme is essential, and I firmly believe that every change or reorientation must take place in a way that respects stability, overall cohesion and legal certainty, which underpin the mutual trust of the participants."
"Research and development play a large part in modernising our economies and strengthening our competitiveness."
"With a budget of EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development is the world's largest programme of support for research."
"The adoption of this report by a strong majority is testament to Parliament's keen interest for the success of this programme and subsequent ones."
"Efforts still need to be made to ensure sound management of public money and prevent funds from being spread too thinly in projects that are not very efficient or that do not meet our needs."
"The future of European research will involve simplifying how programmes are implemented, facilitating access to funding, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) but, above all, adapting our priorities to society's great challenges (ageing population, climate change, and so on)."
"I am convinced that the European Union has a leading role to play in the development of large research programmes and that it can bring real added value by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA)."
"That is why I decided to lend my full support to this report."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it calls for the use of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to take account of the different consequences in each Member State of the economic crisis for the final years of the programme (2011-2013), given the considerable sums (EUR 28.8 billion over three years) still to be programmed, the objectives to be achieved for EU 2020 and preparation for a European Research Area and the Innovation Union."
"It calls, in particular, for the alignment of the FP7 objectives with EU strategies on resource efficiency, raw materials and the Digital Agenda."
"The remaining sums should not be diverted from research and used for other programmes or instruments that do not come within the research and innovation sector or the objectives and scope of FP7."
"There is a need to enhance, stimulate and secure the financing of research and development in the European Union via a significant increase in relevant expenditure from 2013 onwards, because such an increase in funding, ideally by increasing the budget, must foster sustainable growth and competition via excellence."
"This increase in funds must be coupled with a more result-oriented, performance-driven approach and with a radical simplification of funding procedures."
"I believe that we need to support further cooperation between different EU research, technological development and innovation programmes, and feel that the continuity of the future programme, once established, is important for all actors involved."
"Europe's rapidly ageing society requires innovative solutions in diverse areas which will make it possible for it to function efficiently in spite of the reduced workforce."
"Similar challenges are posed by climate change, unexpected deficits of raw materials and biological threats, for example, the recent developments concerning E coli bacteria in vegetables."
"The way to find solutions to such unusual situations is investment in science and technological development."
"Although we have held many debates on this issue, the measures taken in Europe have, unfortunately, been ineffectual, despite the threat posed to our continent and our economy."
"The latter is not self-sufficient, and is additionally faced with the domination of the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian economies, which are developing extraordinarily rapidly."
"Financial support and the simplification of legislative procedures for scientific development should be a priority for the EU."
"To stand still is to move backwards."
"I support the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities because I believe that it truly reflects what has been achieved, as well as existing problems."
"The European Union has the potential to become the world leader in innovation and inventions."
"This would give a new impetus to our economic growth and an improvement in the standard of living of our citizens."
"We have the ability to meet this goal by performing a series of domestic tasks, the most important of which is the reduction of bureaucratic hurdles."
"In order to become the citadel of innovation, we must sacrifice the bureaucracy that does not allow for funds to flow to researchers and entrepreneurs."
"Saddled with the old and rigid system of bureaucracy hindering the development of new and dynamic businesses, the European Union will not reach its target - to invest 3% of GDP in research and innovation by 2020."
"The European Union must change with the times and must cast off the chains of red tape."
"This approach must be implemented beginning with the research programme, which is a source of funding for new inventions, for the realisation of new ideas, and new jobs."
"Paragraph 27 of this report contains information which contradicts the truth."
"The assertion that web sites and individual computer systems are constantly monitored by INDECT is false, as confirmed by the ethical review carried out on the INDECT project in Brussels on 15 March 2011, with the participation of specialists from Austria, France, Holland, Germany and the United Kingdom."
"The ethical review of the INDECT project had a positive outcome, and no infringements relating to the project's ethical aspects were identified."
"INDECT has been subject to constant monitoring by the European Commission from the outset."
"The Commission has not identified any infringements to date."
"Furthermore, this issue is out of place in the report as a whole, and specific reference is made to the INDECT project, with no mention of other similar projects which receive European Union funds."
"The main aim of the INDECT project (Intelligent information system supporting observation, searching and detection for security of citizens in urban environment), which is implemented by the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, is the development of research into information technologies which increase the safety of citizens of urban areas."
"The INDECT system is intended to identify threats by means of monitoring, including, in particular, pornography, arms trading and trafficking in drugs and human organs, and it is also intended to protect data and privacy."
"The Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities (FP7) is the largest research support instrument in the world and represents the primary tool of European Union research policy."
"The actions taken so far to develop knowledge in the most varied of fields demonstrate the ever more acute need to move towards spreading innovations and implementing them in our daily lives."
"It was precisely the direct impact of this instrument on everyday life that led me to vote in favour of the report by Mr Audy, in the hope that future innovation policies will make the absolute most of the synergies in the whole research and development value chain."
"The Seventh Framework Programme - which is mainly oriented towards research and technological development - is currently the only instrument for achieving the objectives laid down in the Innovation Union initiative and for expediting the transformation of Europe into a knowledge-based society."
"Thinking about the future of innovation implies creating jobs, leveraging research capital and translating it into practices that apply to normal life, as well as developing human resource potential - all of which are factors that should be included in the next Framework Programme."
"Every year since 2007, the EU has spent over EUR 6 billion funding research and development on the continent."
"This will present a major challenge for the EU in the decades to come."
"Indeed, Europe lags behind the United States and is being caught up very quickly by the emerging countries; it must therefore quickly re-establish innovation at the forefront of its social model."
"The report by Mr Audy learns lessons from the first part of the Framework Programme for research."
"In order to achieve the Europe 2020 goals, it proposes that the rest of the programme should focus on the Union's most pressing challenges within the sectors identified in the 'Cooperation' chapter of the Seventh Framework Programme: health, food and biotechnology, information and communication technology, nanoscience and nanotechnologies, energy, the SET Plan and the use of biogas, environment, sustainable transport, social sciences, economics and humanities, and space and security."
"I voted in favour of this report because it not only makes an assessment of the situation but also sets ambitious targets for the Union which live up to the expectations of European citizens."
"in writing. - FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, in particular, by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA)."
"Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, FP7 has, over the years, become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy."
"Four main objectives have been identified and correspond to four specific programmes that must structure the European research effort: the Cooperation Programme, the Ideas Programme, the People Programme and the Capacity Programme."
"The aim is to enable the EU to respond to the great societal challenges that concern all Member States and to which they cannot respond alone (ageing population and health, energy, water and food supplies, sustainable development, climate change, and so on), as well as to develop the knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness."
"Over the years, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of European Union research policy."
"After the failure of the so-called 'Lisbon strategy', which aimed for the EU to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, we decided to consider whether the review of FP7 might offer an opportunity to consolidate the golden triangle of knowledge, education and research."
"We believe that FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, in particular, by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA)."
"In addition, research and development policies need to be territorialised and the Union must adopt an ambitious European research plan for defence technology with a view to enhancing the sector's industrial and technological base, while also improving the efficiency of military public spending."
"Lastly, we agree with the Committee on Budgets that the design and implementation of all framework programmes must be based on the principles of simplicity, stability, legal certainty, consistency, excellence and trust, while also strengthening links between European institutions for research and industry."
"The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development (R&TD) is the European Commission's largest financial instrument for supporting and promoting research activity."
"It has a budget allocation of EUR 50 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"This report points to the paths to be followed as regards this Framework Programme for R&TD: it should be linked to the Europe 2020 strategy, but also to the Innovation Union initiative, and its main objective should be the areas of climate change, energy policy, competitiveness and population ageing."
"If we achieve the goals set out here, I have no doubt that we will enter a new economic cycle of growth."
"in writing. - The seventh EU programme aims to build a united European Knowledge Area based upon achievements of former programmes and to implement further research towards strengthening socio-economic factors in the development of Europe."
"Scientific research is one of the bases of the European strategy for economic development, ensuring competency, development of the social area and environmental protection."
"Therefore, I voted in favour."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is not just about research in general; it is also about a specific field of research that ought to be of particular concern to all of us following the Fukushima disaster."
"It is a question of funding from the Euratom programme."
"What is the use of productive reactors if they buckle under water masses and in the event of earthquakes?"
"What is the use of the most productive nuclear power station if a minor fault is enough to make not only the immediate surroundings, but broad swathes of land, uninhabitable for decades?"
"It is important for us to focus more on nuclear safety and to push ahead with the development of alternatives."
"Now that the Euratom research programme is shortly to be extended for the period 2012-2013, Fukushima ought to be taken as an opportunity for a rethink."
"We need to focus more on protection against radiation and final storage."
"It is a matter of life or death that we should not stick to the same priorities, in other words, the expansion of nuclear power, but rather that we should concentrate on safety aspects."
"The present research programme is, of course, unaffected by this."
"I have taken this into account when voting."
"During my time in Parliament, I have campaigned on many occasions for nuclear safety in the EU."
"Such a risky technology for generating energy with all its hazardous by-products and fatal consequences for both man and nature in the event of nuclear meltdown should not be glossed over under the pretext of climate protection."
"Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme also includes funding for research in the field of nuclear power."
"However, the report also calls for stricter regulations for the EU's INDECT programme."
"It states that the EU Commission should immediately publish all project documents and define a clear and strict mandate for the research goal, the application and end users of INDECT."
"This is an initial success in which the rights of the EU's citizens are taken seriously on a rudimentary level at least."
"Having weighed up the issues, I abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Audy because the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be thoroughly revised in order for it to achieve and come into line with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The negative results of the mid-term review mean that we need to amend its priorities."
"I therefore agree on rewording the main objectives and stress the need for a more efficient research policy that cuts out the burden of red tape and provides for greater participation from small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as innovation and funding integration."
"By making these changes, we hope that the projects of the second phase of FP7 will end in success."
"This report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities is based on the premise of reconciling the public with science."
"The Lisbon strategy set an ambitious goal for the European Union: to become, by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"The central role played by research was acknowledged in this strategy."
"This desire was not realised, for a number of reasons."
"The decade 2000-2010, which ended with an extremely serious economic crisis, will be evaluated in the future."
"It is now important, and I share the rapporteur's ambition in this respect, to analyse the work done and reorganise future work."
"FP7 is another opportunity for the EU to put its research policy on a par with its economic and social ambitions, not least by consolidating the European Research Area."
"FP7 is one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy."
"The specific existing programmes, like the Cooperation programme, the Ideas programme, the People programme and the Capacity programme, can and should enable the development of knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness."
"The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be reviewed in order to bring it further into line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"If European research policy is to be more competitive and in tune with the EU's economic and social ambitions, FP7 needs to be tailored to four major objectives: promoting the simplification of the framework programmes for research and cutting the burdens of administrative procedures; improving the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); strengthening the innovation dimension and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility."
"In addition, we need to focus on the importance of collaboration between the academic world, public research institutes and the industrial sector."
"We must place greater emphasis on proposals for collaborative research between the public and industrial sectors, ease cooperation between networks of SMEs, universities and public research institutes, and the main criteria for choosing FP7 projects must now include an assessment of the possible impact on the market, technology transfer and the commercial use of research outcomes."
"I voted in favour of reviewing FP7 for these very reasons and also so that the EU can be more competitive in the field of research without having to wait for the Eighth Framework Programme."
"I voted in favour of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development."
"With this text, the European Parliament confirms its support for this programme, which is of vital importance for developing European research and improving the competitiveness of our businesses."
"It defends the establishment of a permanent budget, which is essential if it is going to be able to meet its targets."
"This report then sets out specific proposals with the aim of resolving the programme's weaknesses."
"It rightly highlights the need to simplify funding procedures and optimise existing instruments, so as to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research."
"in writing. - This report considers whether the review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7) may offer an opportunity to consolidate the golden triangle of knowledge, education and research that is the key to Europeans' destiny."
"I welcome the level of participation and excellence in project selection but regret, however, that the success rate under this programme generally remains quite low and is a disincentive, particularly for SMEs."
"I support, within the framework of the 'People' chapter, the Marie Curie Actions, which are of great value to researchers in their career and acknowledge that 'Joint Technological Initiatives' (JTIs) assist the competitiveness of European industry."
"in writing. - Given the economic crises the EU is facing, it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties."
"Research and innovation are central to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, so investment in R&D is the best possible response."
"Considering the numerous political and economic changes that have taken place since the Seventh Framework Programme was adopted, it is necessary to amend FP7 to reflect the situation of the new reality."
"Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving R&D sector, we cannot afford to wait until FP8 to take action."
"The 'Lisbon strategy' of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 may have failed, but this does not mean we should abandon it entirely."
"We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7."
"In doing so, we should address a serious failure under FP7 to provide funding for research in maternal and child health."
"Close to 400 000 babies are born prematurely annually, yet there is no funding for research in this area."
"Pre-term birth is the number one cause of infant death and premature babies are far more likely to develop lifelong chronic illnesses."
"The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities should be evaluated with a view to the current state of the European Union, but with an eye on the future."
"The rapporteur rightly points out the failure of the goal set by the European Council in 2000 of becoming the most prevalent knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"However, although this same goal was not achieved by the deadline, it remains the true purpose of common action."
"Therefore, the evaluation of the Framework Programme can play a significant role in this respect: in other words, by seeking to reduce the obstacles to the European economy's growth that have been emerging, specifically by cutting red tape in procedures for accessing research support programmes."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The report was already adopted unanimously by the ITRE Committee, takes on board the recommendations of the expert group and identifies further scope for improvement of the various EU research instruments."
"For instance: more open access and dissemination of research results, wider calls in the field of socio-economic sciences, more collaborative research, efforts to improve the mobility of researchers, more actions for innovative SMEs, better coordination with the Member States."
"The report does not cover the issue of ITER or of Galileo investments."
"On the negative side, the text is sometimes too much oriented towards the economic role and competitiveness of research and innovation rather than towards what research and innovation can bring to society as a whole."
"Research is an essential component of the world of knowledge and, in a globalised economy, it is certain to bolster growth and employment levels in the European Union."
"The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) is a good opportunity for the European Union to develop its research policy, while also consolidating the European Research Area (ERA)."
"Through this programme, Europe aims to satisfy the requirements of industry - and more generally, of European policies - for research and knowledge."
"By adopting today's report, Parliament shines a light on the results achieved by the research programme in these first four years."
"Yet to achieve bigger and better results in the future, we need to simplify the administrative process, improve the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, support innovation and adopt risk-sharing finance facilities."
"The report also urges the EU and the Member States to adopt an ambitious research plan to consolidate the European defence industry."
"I voted in favour of Mr Audy's report because I consider investment in the research and innovation sector to be fundamental to competitiveness, growth and job creation in the EU."
"I consider the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development 2007-2013 to be particularly useful for the purpose of drawing useful conclusions based on an evaluation of the current situation."
"I welcome the rapporteur's proposal to simplify financing procedures and to adopt a performance-driven approach and the criteria of 'excellence' and 'European added value' in EU spending."
"The research sector is a sector which can bring maximum added value to the Union."
"Public budgets have been cut and, as such, private funding should be mobilised in order to finance the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme for research."
"I therefore approve of the rapporteur's proposal to increase the participation of industrial groups and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Four years have passed since the introduction of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development."
"In the context of a changing global economic situation and at a time when Europe is slowly attempting to extricate itself from the economic crisis, it is becoming clear that the programme was put in place to solve legitimate and significant problems."
"The global competition of major economic powers such as China, India and Brazil is forcing us to take special measures, aimed at gaining a technological advantage allowing us to implement the European Union's intended strategy effectively."
"The right investments in research and scientific development will translate into the long-term construction of a knowledge-based society, which is one of the most important components of economic power."
"The report touches upon the key issue of insufficient cooperation and exchange of information between Member States, which results in the duplication of individual projects."
"A further alarming matter is the unequal participation of the Member States, which results in greater imbalances in an area as important as research and technological development."
"This is a complete contradiction of the goals of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"As a result of the economic crisis, some Member States no longer have as many opportunities to provide support for the programme, and this is a challenge to the EU to identify accurately those who need support, and to grant support to them."
"The programme's implementation will last another two years, and the level of budgetary commitment has not exceeded 50% (of EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013), which should make it easier to involve the competent bodies and enable the funds available to be used as appropriately as possible."
"in writing. - I support the work done by the rapporteur in this report."
"I share his concerns that the Commission communication was delivered so much later than promised."
"The FP7 has delivered some excellent work and I am encouraged by the work done by the rapporteur to close the golden triangle."
"The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development (R&TD) is the European Commission's largest financial instrument for supporting and promoting research activity, and it has a budget allocation of EUR 50 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"This report stresses that the FP7 for R&TD should be linked to the 'Europe 2020' strategy and to the 'Innovation Union' flagship initiative, and that it should focus, until its term expires, on the areas of climate change, energy policy, competitiveness and population ageing."
"I am voting for this report because I understand that only by reinforcing European research, development and innovation policy will it be possible for it to increase its competitiveness and adopt an increasingly leading role at global level."
"I also consider it important that the Seventh Framework Programme contributes to establishing the European Research Area, pursuant to Article 179(1) of Title XIX of the Treaty on European Union."
"Research and innovations are important for ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth in Lithuania."
"According to data from the World Bank, Lithuania has great potential to become a dynamic, knowledge-based economy."
"However, the study also states that in the research and development (R&D) sector, my country faces managerial, structural and regulatory problems."
"We must overcome these obstacles if we want to make real progress."
"This also poses problems for Europe."
"In Europe, R&D expenditure is low compared to other global powers, due to a lack of private investment and favourable conditions for innovation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we really need better coordination of research projects and cofinancing within the Union."
"Furthermore, research facilities and infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe must be modernised and expanded."
"This will encourage European competitiveness and help to overcome infrastructural disparities between the old and new Member States."
"I also believe that research and technological development must become more accessible to ordinary Europeans."
"According to data from a European Commission survey, only 10% of Europeans feel they are well informed about science, while 65% feel that governments should make more efforts to interest young people in scientific matters."
"We should do the same."
"I am voting for this resolution as I believe there is a need for a comprehensive economic agreement capable of strengthening already existing strong bilateral ties in terms of trade and investment."
"However, I believe that the agreement should be balanced and encourage fair trade."
"Despite the strong consensus on an ambitious agreement, I argue that it should not affect public services or the EU's rights to legislate on the Fuel Quality Directive."
"The agreement should also have ambitious sustainable development targets, with legally binding social and environmental parameters."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on EU-Canada trade relations."
"Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation. However, the EU-Canada economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential and I feel that an EU-Canada free trade agreement can strongly contribute to developing and realising this by improving trade and investment flows while removing tariff peaks and unjustified non-tariff barriers and supporting closer cooperation, particularly in the fields of regulatory cooperation, labour mobility and recognition of qualifications."
"I welcome an agreement with Canada going beyond the WTO commitments and being complementary to multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement that goes well beyond tariff reductions, and other tools begin to be applied."
"For instance, the reciprocity principle should be applied in the context of the legal remedies available in the event of commercial disputes, and there is a need to improve the protection of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents and geographical indications."
"By voting in favour of this resolution on the current trade negotiations between the EU and Canada, I wish to reiterate the importance of international trade (including with Canada) for developing our economies."
"As stated in the resolution, even though Europe must continue giving priority to the international trading system, that is, the Doha Development Round negotiations, the current negotiations with Canada can usefully complement this international approach with a bilateral approach, which is equally necessary."
"Thus, by discussing and negotiating, we are managing to find solutions on issues related to trade and respect for certain principles, such as those concerning the environment."
"However, as Vice-Chair of the working group on public services, I am concerned about the approach chosen for this sector."
"Indeed, by adopting a 'negative list approach' (a list that excludes certain public services from the liberalisation process) and not, on the contrary, 'a positive list approach' (exempting public services from liberalisation, except those featured in the list), we may well end up weakening public services."
"This resolution therefore urges the European Commission to abandon this approach."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation. A number of bilateral agreements designed to facilitate stronger trade relations have been signed over the years and currently, the EU is Canada's second most important trading partner and Canada's second largest source of foreign direct investment."
"I agree that that the EU-Canada economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential."
"The free trade agreement planned could make a significant contribution towards advancing the EU-Canada economic partnership and would send a powerful pro-growth signal to investors and business within the EU and Canada."
"Whereas a commercial agreement is currently under negotiation between the European Union and Canada, the European Parliament, through this resolution that we have just adopted, is expressing concern about the European Commission's approach in relation to public services."
"Indeed, the European Commission, responsible for negotiating this agreement, seems to want all services to be included, in principle."
"By negotiating a 'negative' list of services that would not be included in the free trade agreements, and if it were to go ahead, the Commission would be reversing the rationale that has prevailed hitherto."
"Yet public services are not like other services: because they provide social and territorial cohesion as well as essential support to vulnerable populations, these services have features specific to the general interest they seek to attain."
"Consequently, it is crucial to continue adopting an approach that protects these services, particularly by protecting them from international competition."
"Relations with Canada have long been profitable for both parties and, in commercial terms, are of mutual interest and involve good cooperation."
"Despite the fact that Canada is a developed country, where very few questions could be raised over the level of respect for social rights and the highest environmental standards, the Commission - before Parliament, even - has set out a basis for negotiations with the equivalent Canadian authorities which goes into detail on many issues that need to be modified in order for us to be satisfied."
"I am voting in favour of this resolution, which relates to a chapter of the European commercial policy that should be taken as a model for negotiations with other countries - including India, China and Pakistan - which certainly do not guarantee fair competition, let alone respect for social rights and environmental standards, as Canada does."
"When we embark on negotiations with these countries, we should remember how strict and exacting we have been with extremely enlightened places like Canada and adopt the same direct and open attitude in defence of our interests."
"in writing. - I voted against the trade relationship between the EU and Canada as I feel any BIT could undermine the Commonwealth negotiation between UK and Canada."
"While I see no reason why the EU and Canada cannot trade freely, prior legislation has demonstrated the EU ambition is predisposed to usurp rather than parallel extant trade relationships between the UK and third countries."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on EU-Canada trade relations aimed at establishing a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement."
"Canada is a close trading partner of the European Union: over 10 years, Canadian investment in Europe almost doubled, reaching EUR 119.5 million in 2009."
"It is therefore necessary to establish an advanced legal framework so as to ensure a positive impact on growth."
"I would like to highlight the issue of market access for agricultural products."
"Rules of origin are different in Canada and the EU, and the Commission must make sure that the interests and priorities of European agriculture are properly taken into account."
"In particular, efforts should be made to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of rules of origin so that products from other North American Free Trade Agreement members do not follow in the wake of Canadian products."
"The multilateral trade system, based on rules and established through the World Trade Organisation (WTO), remains the most suitable means of regulating and promoting open and fair trade."
"However, given the historical and very successful economic relationship between the EU and Canada, I support an agreement that transcends the commitments made within the framework of the WTO and is in addition to the multilateral rules, so as to achieve the maximum potential of cooperation between these two powers."
"I voted for the resolution on EU-Canada trade relations because it highlights the need to include social and environmental issues in the future Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada."
"As far as environmental protection is concerned, I think that it is important for the European Union to refuse to import oil extracted from oil sands."
"As part of the ongoing negotiations on the trade agreement between the EU and Canada, the Commission must undertake to comply with the European Parliament's demands."
"In a free trade agreement, two things are vital: first, ensuring reciprocity in respect of social and environmental legislation; second, adopting a consistent and protective approach to services of general interest."
"European environmental and health standards should not be lowered just to satisfy our partner."
"The European Commission must consider the consequences of its decision to include all services automatically and by default."
"While this method allows certain public services to be excluded on a case-by-case basis and at the request of each Member State by establishing a 'negative' list, it nevertheless runs the risk of potential omissions."
"Parliament does not wish for this new model of negotiation to set a legal precedent."
"Up to now, the Commission has negotiated free trade agreements by providing a 'positive' list, listing services covered by the agreement one by one."
"This method, which is commonly used in international trade, provides a better safeguard for certain sensitive sectors for the EU and should therefore be the sole method used by the Commission."
"Canada and the EU share a set of values, making us not just trade partners, but also natural allies in the global geostrategic situation."
"It is a fact that there is a single civilisation on both sides of the Atlantic which would gain a great deal from strengthening even further the ties between its peoples."
"It would not be productive to expound at length on the historical ties between Canada and Europe, and on the contribution that its citizens made to liberate the European continent during the two world wars that devastated it."
"Despite the obstacles to trade liberalisation that still remain and the Union's reservations regarding current practices in Canada, I hope that the necessary bases can be established for a mutually beneficial trade partnership sooner rather than later."
"A comprehensive economic and commercial agreement between Canada and the European Union could end up being the most ambitious and wide-ranging that we have yet concluded."
"I hope that will be the case."
"This motion for a resolution is on EU-Canada trade relations, whose negotiations are expected to be concluded by the end of 2011."
"The goal of the EU's trade and investment policy is economic growth that is sustainable, generates wealth and creates jobs."
"Let us recall that the conclusion of trade relationships with our strategic partners will enable the EU to have added value of 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020, which was EUR 120 billion in 2010, benefiting consumers and businesses alike."
"To this end, and without questioning the role played by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is crucial to liberalise trade by concluding all negotiations under way within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), of which EU-Canada trade relations are part."
"Although some issues remain unresolved, such as the negative impact on biodiversity of tar sands extraction and of some seal-derived products, I voted in favour not only because the public procurement problem has practically been resolved, but also because of the benefits to the Member States, and to prevent the negotiations from suffering any delays."
"The first item in the preamble illustrates the vision guiding this report: it states that the multilateral trade system established through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) continues to represent the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade."
"It continues by advocating the successful conclusion of the Doha Round."
"This is a vision that is developed in the subsequent points of a resolution with which we naturally disagree."
"We disagree, in fact, just like the millions of workers, farmers, small and medium-sized business owners, and many others across the world who have, for years, been pointing an accusing finger at the WTO, at its goals of deregulating trade and at the interests it serves: those of the multinationals; of large companies and financial institutions, which rake in millions at the expense of sacrificing millions of jobs and labour and social rights, destroying small and medium-sized producers and degrading the environment."
"The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement, like the others, also covers services and worthy, but inconsistent concerns are being expressed relating to 'negative lists' or others, which do not remove the threats also hanging over public services."
"There are more than enough reasons to vote against."
"The European Union continues to build its trade policy with consequences that affect the various Member States profoundly but differently."
"The agreements that give concrete expression to this policy are essentially based on free trade, whose goals and effects are clearly demonstrated by the associated rhetoric: that of so-called 'offensive interests', as if we were talking about a war."
"They are generally agreements that lack increasing democratic legitimacy as they are almost always negotiated in the greatest secrecy, behind the public's backs, in an attempt to cover up their economic, social and environmental impact, and avoid informed debate and clarification."
"With negotiations at a stage said to be fairly advanced and their conclusion envisaged for 2011, its impact on sectors and countries has yet to be fully debated."
"However, the content of this agreement is nothing new: the opening up of markets, and the liberalisation of services, including increasingly commercialised public services, which are at the mercy of the interests of multinationals, and cause trouble for the people."
"The consequences are well-known: the domination of markets by a few, the destruction of weaker production systems, and increasing pretexts for attacks on rights, and on living and working conditions."
"The EU commenced talks on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada in 2009."
"The potential agreement covers a broad range of topics: trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, public procurement, regulatory cooperation, investment, temporary migration, competition policy and employment and environmental standards."
"In my opinion, it is right for both sides to prioritise efforts to reach agreement over several fundamental points, such as the issues of public procurement, investment and public services."
"I welcomed the document because the EU and Canada have a close relationship as far as trade and foreign direct investment are concerned."
"The ongoing negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) aim at a very advanced agreement, exceeding in its level of ambition any trade and economic agreement negotiated either by the EU or by Canada to date, that could reinforce the already strong bilateral trade and investment relationship even further."
"I welcome an agreement with Canada going beyond the WTO commitments and being complementary to multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement."
"I feel that agriculture chapters will constitute an important issue for both parties in these negotiations."
"I am concerned about possibly substantial concessions in the area of GMOs, milk and origin labelling."
"The interests and the priorities in agriculture should therefore be fully taken into account and the agreement must be beneficial to EU and Canadian consumers and to the agricultural sectors on both sides as well, and ensure, within a balanced overall outcome, greater - but fair - competition among EU and Canadian suppliers providing agricultural goods."
"I welcome the initial commitment from both parties not to maintain, introduce or reintroduce agricultural export subsidies on the agricultural goods traded, this being a positive step in the interests of ambitious and fair negotiations, as well as the agreement to cooperate in WTO agricultural negotiations."
"The European Union and Canada have had good, solid trade relations for many years."
"However, the potential for economic cooperation is far from exhausted and I welcome the negotiations in relation to the CETA."
"Nonetheless, progress in WTO negotiations must be given priority over bilateral agreements."
"This resolution covers a range of important themes."
"I particularly support the reservations expressed by the European Parliament in relation to the possible negative impact on European agriculture."
"The principle of mutuality must be preserved in order to ensure a solid, sustainable agreement for both sides."
"In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles, such as protracted approval procedures for EU products."
"Clearly, the aim of the CETA must be fair competition."
"In view of the fact that the European Union is Canada's second largest trade partner, and that Canada is a major partner for the EU in the field of foreign direct investment, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on EU-Canada trade relations."
"At the same time, I would like to emphasise that Poland is Canada's largest trading partner among the Central and Eastern European countries and, for a dozen or so years, has maintained a bilateral trade surplus which has grown year on year."
"Today's vote is a key step forward which bodes well for the future."
"in writing. - I am delighted that my amendment, which 'takes note of the recent legal developments regarding the EU's ban on seal products, in particular, Canada's request to the WTO for the establishment of a formal dispute resolution panel, and expresses its strong hope that Canada will withdraw the WTO challenge, which runs counter to positive trade relations, prior to the need for ratification of the CETA agreement by the European Parliament', was carried."
"Commercial relations between the European Union and Canada can go well beyond the commitments undertaken through the World Trade Organisation as long as they are based on a balanced agreement, a guarantee of proper reciprocal access to each other's markets and improved protection for trademarks, patents and geographical indications."
"Fresh investments are, in our view, needed in order to ensure respect for the environment and good working conditions."
"Since the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance, we urge the Commission to negotiate an agreement that is beneficial for producers and consumers alike, and which ensures fair competition between providers of agricultural products from the European Union and Canada."
"Lastly, we think that the Council should obtain Parliament's consent before signing any further international commercial agreements, and that Parliament should be kept informed throughout all phases of the procedure in order to guarantee greater democratic control."
"This is the only way that we can achieve higher growth in trade and investments between the European Union and Canada."
"I voted for the resolution but against Amendment 10 which supports the ban on importing seal products imposed by the EU."
"This ban is not justified, neither scientifically nor legally."
"Indeed, the conclusions of the scientific opinion given by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) at the end of 2007 are based on data concerning the slaughter of animals in abattoirs and which are not reliable with regard to seal hunting."
"The legal base is also questionable, as the European Parliament's legal opinion, dated 1 April 2009, shows: 'It seems virtually impossible to justify the ban on the sole basis of animal well-being, since the Treaty contains no legal basis on animal well-being'."
"The protection of the species, for its part, is not at stake, its population having even tripled in Greenland over 25 years."
"Finally, an embargo on which the Commission gives assurances that there would be no impact on Inuit traditional hunting is unrealistic."
"In this context, the request submitted by Canada to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) concerning the creation of a special dispute settlement body in relation to the European embargo is justified."
"in writing. - Parliament has given a strong signal in its resolution on the EU-Canada trade negotiations that it will rigorously defend its legislation to ban seal products from the EU market."
"EU citizens demanded we take action to keep the products of the cruel commercial hunt out of the EU."
"Canada has no right to try and undermine the democratic will of European citizens by taking our clearly non-discriminatory seal ban law to the World Trade Organisation."
"Closer trade ties between the EU and Canada can only be built on a basis of respect for the wishes of the European public and for European law."
"The European Commission is about to conclude negotiations with Canada on a free trade agreement of unprecedented scope."
"It has been negotiating since 2004."
"European citizens were never consulted or even informed."
"The report welcomes this harmful agreement whose content has only been revealed through leaks."
"This is unacceptable."
"I shall vote against the report and I condemn this agreement, which gives the people of Europe a subordinate role, following the example of the North American Free Trade Agreement."
"The historical relationship between Europe and Canada is long, and even predates the EU."
"Moreover, we share the same values and principles, making us preferential allies in the global geostrategic situation."
"There has been significant progress with trade relations, although there is still no comprehensive agreement."
"I believe that we should continue to make every effort to reach an agreement that suits everyone, since it will be very important for both sides' economic development."
"in writing. - The potential agreement covers a wide range of issues: trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, public procurement, regulatory cooperation, investment, temporary migration (mode IV), competition policy and labour and environmental standards."
"Both parties still need to find an agreement on several crucial chapters of the negotiations, among others, on access to government procurement, investment and public services."
"There are two other issues that came up in the negotiations that are quite sensitive in the EP."
"The first issue concerns the Canadian oil sands and the EU's Fuel Quality Directive."
"The Fuel Quality Directive has been highly debated in the Committee on the Environment."
"As yet, the Canadian Government believes this directive discriminates between Canadian oil imports and oil imports from other countries."
"I consider the agreement to be too early."
"The second issue is the EU's ban on seal products and it is highly important."
"This agreement could reinforce the already strong bilateral trade and investment relationship between the EU and Canada; however, it should be mutually beneficial and therefore, I have abstained from voting as yet."
"A progressive agreement will encourage and accelerate active trade and investment relations between the EU and Canada."
"The liberalisation of trade relations will bring mutual benefits for business actors and will create more favourable investment conditions."
"To achieve a comprehensive, high-quality agreement that goes beyond the WTO commitments, neither party should express requirements that conflict with their internal policies or institutional arrangements."
"Furthermore, in the event of commercial disputes, the reciprocity principle should be applied, the protection of intellectual property rights should be improved and there should be reciprocal access to the services and public procurement markets."
"Particular attention should be paid to the agricultural sector and consumers."
"We must maintain a firm stance on GMOs, milk and origin labelling."
"We must ensure fair and greater competition among agricultural goods suppliers."
"I feel that the Commission should begin negotiations with Canada on investment once Parliament has expressed its position on the future EU investment policy."
"We must protect the parties' most sensitive sectors, so that they are excluded from the scope of investment agreements."
"The Commission must take a firm stance on the ban on seal products and, in this regard, Canada should withdraw its requirement for the WTO to establish a formal dispute resolution panel."
"Such a requirement does not conform with the principles of positive trade relations."
"I welcome this European Parliament resolution on EU-Canada trade relations."
"There is a natural partnership between the EU and Canada founded on cultural similarities and a long shared history."
"It is only natural, therefore, that the private sectors in both the EU and Canada have shown strong support for an ambitious and comprehensive economic agreement, and believe that advancing a closer EU-Canada economic partnership would send a powerful pro-growth signal to investors and business within the EU and Canada as well as internationally."
"I therefore welcome an agreement with Canada that transcends the World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments and is in addition to the multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce an ambitious, high-quality agreement, based on reciprocity and that goes beyond mere tariff reductions."
"I would, however, warn of the need to consider the economic impact of this opening up, especially on the Member States whose economies are more vulnerable."
"At the present time, the trade system of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) seems to be the best way to offer a reference framework for economic relations between states."
"However, it does not prevent states or supranational organisations from increasing their economic relations beyond that common regulation."
"Therefore, a particularly close economic relationship between the EU and Canada seems justified."
"As stressed in the report, the EU is Canada's second most important trade partner."
"For its part, in 1976, Canada became the first industrialised country with which the EU signed a framework agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, and it is the EU's fourth largest source of foreign direct investment."
"An agreement could lead to relations between the two areas reaching even greater levels of economic cooperation, creating even stronger links between these two areas, which are already profoundly linked by a common cultural approach."
"in writing. - In favour."
"Negotiations with Canada on a far-reaching Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) are well advanced and could be concluded this autumn."
"The CETA is by far the most ambitious bilateral FTA the EU has ever negotiated under the 2006 'Global Europe' trade strategy."
"It includes far-reaching chapters on Services, Procurement, Investment Protection, Intellectual Property and Regulatory Cooperation."
"Economic relations between the EU and Canada are of key significance for the development of dialogue between the two parties."
"After the US, the EU is Canada's biggest trade partner, whereas Canada is the EU's 11th biggest trade partner."
"The aim of the ongoing negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is the conclusion of a very wide-ranging agreement, with more ambitious goals than any of the economic and trade agreements negotiated to date by either the EU or Canada."
"Bilateral trade and investment links are already strong, and this may result in them becoming even stronger."
"According to the joint report by experts from the EU and Canada, the conclusion of a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is intended to provide tangible economic benefits, which will result from trade liberalisation and the elimination of tariff barriers."
"Nevertheless, certain problems still remain regarding this agreement, which may have a negative impact on the EU's agricultural sector."
"In my opinion, more work needs to be done in terms of the differences between the sanitary and phytosanitary standards in force in the EU and in Canada."
"Furthermore, more work needs to be done to ensure the compliance of environmental standards in Canada with those in force in the EU."
"In connection with the above, I believe that it is necessary to carry out a detailed analysis and evaluation of the abovementioned standards."
"in writing. - I welcome today's resolution, which highlights progress in negotiations for an EU trade agreement with Canada."
"Canada is an important potential trading partner for the EU, and both parties will profit from such an agreement."
"However, there are some concerns which the Commission needs to take into account: the environmental impact of extracting oil from tar sands and the health of workers mining asbestos are just two issues which need to be looked at carefully."
"I support calls for Canada to withdraw its WTO challenge on the EU's ban on seal products and am pleased that amendments outlining this position were adopted by Parliament."
"The Commission also needs to take a strong position to protect the ban."
"Intellectual property rights must also be adhered to with the use of trademarks and patents."
"I am confident that these problems will be dealt with and taken into account by the Commission and that an effective trade agreement will be agreed."
"I am voting for this own-initiative report since it tackles the current issues in the interminable debate on the ratings industry: specifically, the lack of competition, oligopolistic structures, and the lack of accountability and transparency, primarily as regards rating sovereign debt."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on credit rating agencies: future perspectives."
"Credit rating agency (CRA) ratings fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers in a global environment."
"Ratings allow issuers to assess global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, and this provides markets with liquidity and helps to set prices."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted three problems in the industry: a lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings on the part of CRAs."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that credit ratings are not just pure opinions and that CRAs should be accountable for their ratings."
"Therefore, their exposure to civil liability should be enhanced in order to provide a credible threat."
"I voted in favour of Mr Klinz's report on credit rating agencies."
"Credit rating agencies are useful: they provide information about the quality of credit products, enabling debtors and investors to access global and domestic markets and ultimately help fix prices."
"However, the crisis has demonstrated the dangers created by the current system: the lack of competition and a lack of accountability and transparency of agencies in particular."
"This is an own-initiative report which calls on the European Commission to clearly identify the shortcomings of the current framework and to provide an impact study outlining the potential different alternatives for improving the system, including new legislation if necessary."
"I urge the Commission to respond to our request as soon as possible."
"I voted in favour of this important document."
"Rating agencies assess not just private equity companies and their products, but also countries."
"The conditions under which a country can expect to borrow on international markets depend on the rating it receives."
"Negative ratings in the face of financial difficulties send a country into a kind of debt spiral, because a falling rating increases the cost of borrowing even more and makes the country's financial situation even worse."
"All market participants and their supervisors must know the criteria used to set ratings and be able to check these themselves."
"The Commission and the G20 countries are asked to establish a new global approach to assessment, which would reduce the likelihood of errors, would regulate the activities of companies involved in ratings and would reduce the risk associated with financial assessment."
"I welcome and have, on several occasions, repeated the proposal that Europe urgently needs to establish its own credit rating agency, which would produce objective and independent assessments."
"I welcome the report's call to establish our own independent rating agency, which, according to the proposals, would initially be called the European Credit Rating Foundation."
"The possibilities for all EU Member States to borrow in international markets under the right conditions, as well as the stability of the whole global financial system and the effectiveness of crisis prevention, will depend on how successfully we can reform financial assessment."
"Credit rating agencies (CRAs) assess countries, institutions and companies, assigning risk ratings regarding their ability to pay their debts on the agreed date."
"Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on CRAs was adopted as a first reaction to the financial crisis."
"This regulation dealt with the most pressing issues, subjecting CRAs to oversight and regulation."
"However, it did not solve all the problems."
"Indeed, the financial crisis has demonstrated that there are three key problems in how these agencies operate: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings and no accountability."
"This report, which I voted for, calls on the European Commission to identify the failings and provide an impact assessment on the possible alternatives, including further legislative proposals."
"It also calls on the European Commission to assess the costs and benefits of creating a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation."
"I supported the proposed report because I think that creating credit rating agencies will boost competition in this sector, which is a prerequisite for enhancing quality, reducing information costs and, last but not least, increasing the relevant agencies' accountability."
"This will also help reduce regulatory dependence."
"I voted in favour of Mr Klinz's draft report on credit rating agencies because I think the edited text contains many positive elements and good ideas."
"In particular, I agree with the aspiration to improve the transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability of these agencies."
"What is more, I support Mr Klinz's idea to establish a European Credit Rating Foundation that would be independent of States and institutions, and I share his belief that the current oligopoly is a problem for the sector."
"The recent financial crisis has drawn attention to three key problems in the area of rating agencies, which are the lack of economic competition, the excessive dependency of the regulatory framework on external rating assessments, and the fact that the rating agencies provide no guarantee for their ratings."
"I am not sure whether the rapporteur's proposal to establish a European Rating Agency is a sensible solution."
"There is no guarantee that the European Rating Agency would acquire a good reputation and would become a genuine new player among rating agencies, that it would be credible, or that it would be able to convince the market of its absolute independence of any public body, whether the Member States, the European Commission or any other public entity."
"The rapporteur's proposal to establish a network of European rating agencies seems more sensible to me, since cooperation between rating agencies active at national level in making use of the available human and financial resources should encourage competition in this area by covering a broad range of activities and different markets, thereby making it possible to achieve the same level as the large rating agencies which have a global scale of operations."
"in writing. - I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of credit rating agencies as the standards may vary, and necessarily so, between Member States."
"Without one single common currency, and in view of the volatility of markets, particularly in the failing eurozone economies, the UK faces the possibility of being tangled in a mire of harmonised credit ratings which would have to encompass all economic circumstances across the Union and could expose UK business and industry to hazardous ventures supported by EU-wide credit ratings."
"It is up to independent economies in independent Member States to determine their conditions and limitations concerning credit rating."
"Given the consequences that credit ratings for sovereign debt can have for the market, budgetary balances and the general welfare of the people, it is imperative that these be based on trustworthy facts and figures."
"In order to preserve the truth and fairness of such ratings, there is a need to increase the transparency underlying these decisions, as well as the accountability of these agencies."
"I therefore support and welcome the establishment of priorities for the regulation of credit rating agencies proposed today, which I consider essential in order to overcome the problems in this industry."
"in writing. - The situation with credit ratings agencies must be addressed in Europe."
"These private, profit-orientated organisations have far too much power over sovereign governments and I fully support plans to address this anomaly at European level."
"I voted against the report on credit rating agencies."
"It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU itself, to rate not only companies, but also the economies of the Member States."
"The European Parliament should be more decisive and radical in its decisions on action by credit rating agencies, especially after the damage they have caused to European economies and European citizens."
"However, the report is spineless."
"The regulations it proposes are cowardly and the lack of transparency surrounding credit rating agencies basically remains as before."
"By no stretch of the imagination has the problem been resolved of ratings by self-seeking private firms, be they American now or European in the future, which alone foster the speculation mafia."
"The report should promote a public, democratically-controlled agency which has nothing to do with private interests and which can play a particular role within the framework of solidarity between the States and their citizens."
"I voted in favour of this report because it sets out the situation relating to credit rating agencies (CRAs) clearly and objectively."
"I, too, believe that CRAs play a necessary and extremely useful role in distilling and simplifying the torrent of information about the financial markets, both in terms of the solvency and reliability of debt issuers as well as in terms of individual financial instruments."
"However, as Mr Klinz rightly points out, this business model risks drawing attention away from protecting investors and towards protecting debt issuers, unless suitable corrective measures are taken."
"I do not think that competition can be improved, since the proliferation of agencies could undermine the credibility of ratings."
"However, I think that greater responsibility could translate into greater objectivity and more thorough work, which would protect not just the affairs of the few but help reduce information imbalances, which amounts to safeguarding the functioning of the markets and also the general interest."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Mr Klinz's report."
"It contains some interesting proposals for pursuing the necessary framework for credit rating agencies."
"The current situation in the euro area reminds us on an almost daily basis of the impact of decisions taken by these agencies and the reliance of the global financial regulatory system on these agencies."
"I particularly welcome the request made to the European Commission to look at the feasibility of introducing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation."
"This is a concrete proposal which would enable us to address the over-reliance of the global financial regulatory system on some non-public credit ratings."
"in writing. - I support this report on the future of credit rating agencies (CRAs)."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are major problems with this business, such as over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs."
"Indeed, CRAs played a significant role in the build-up to the financial crisis through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments."
"This report, in advance of the legislative proposal the Commission is preparing for the autumn, addresses these issues, calling for: a review of whether and how Member States use ratings for regulatory purposes in order to reduce the general over-reliance on them of the financial regulatory system; a detailed impact assessment and viability study on the costs, benefits and potential governance structure of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation; the exploration of establishing a truly independent European Credit Rating Agency; the establishment of a European Rating Index which incorporates all ratings of registered CRAs that are available on the market."
"One after the other, credit rating agencies are downgrading the credit ratings of those European countries affected most by the crisis or placing them on 'negative alert'."
"I am talking about Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain."
"Although the agencies may not have triggered the global financial crisis, such actions on their part have, nonetheless, exacerbated it."
"In fact, they encourage speculation, jeopardising the chances of success of the already draconian recovery plans imposed on their people."
"That is why the creation of a European credit rating agency is urgent, adopting the legal status of an independent foundation."
"There must also be an end to the conflicts of interest inherent in credit rating agencies, which are currently able to issue ratings whilst acting as consultants."
"This is a change that should go hand in hand with the Commission's assessment of the need for greater disclosure of information for all products in the field of financial instruments."
"Ever since the economic and financial crisis began, there has been talk of nothing but credit rating agencies (CRAs)."
"However, what are our thoughts on their now key role?"
"The European Parliament has addressed this issue."
"Although CRA ratings fulfil several useful purposes (for example, they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers, which is particularly helpful in our global environment), developments in the regulatory framework have turned these 'information intermediaries' into de facto 'regulatory licensors', a mistake that we must not make!"
"The financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs."
"The role played by the credit rating agencies (CRAs) is undoubtedly important for the current market economy."
"These agencies started out as information middlemen, facilitating access to the market for debt issuers and investors, enabling reduced information costs and, therefore, greater liquidity and transparency."
"However, as is the case in many other areas of this sector, the crisis has demonstrated three key problems: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for CRA ratings."
"There is an urgent need to review the role of these agencies for regulating the global financial market and find effective solutions for their lack of competition."
"It is also crucial to assess the conflicts of interest in this business model."
"Credit rating agencies (CRAs) provide ratings for three different sectors - the public sector, companies and structured finance instruments - and played a significant role in the path that led to the financial crisis, through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments, which had to be downgraded on average three to four notches during the crisis."
"Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 was the first reaction to the financial crisis and already deals with the most pressing issues, subjecting CRAs to oversight and regulation."
"However, I hope that greater transparency in the actions of CRAs will be obligatory."
"The absence of regulatory certainty in this sector is putting the proper functioning of EU financial markets at risk and therefore requires the Commission, before tabling further amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, to identify properly the gaps in the new framework and provide an impact assessment on the range of alternatives available to fill such gaps, including the possibility of further legislative proposals."
"The credit rating industry has several problems, some of the most important of which include the lack of competition, oligopolistic structures and the lack of accountability and transparency."
"The situation over the last few years has thoroughly demonstrated how little credibility credit rating agencies (CRAs) have."
"Nonetheless, they continue to have free rein, and their actions are extremely damaging, especially for countries with weaker economies."
"As entities that are dependent on the financial system and very much stakeholders in the ratings they issue, they make a living, above all, from disproportionately stimulating credit and capitalist financial speculation."
"These agencies are a clear expression of the financialisation of the economy - that do not translate or correspond to actual increases in productive activity - and they constitute a central part of neoliberalism's development strategy, which is always seeking levels of profit that real production cannot ensure, because of the well-known trend towards decreasing profits."
"While this report does make some criticisms of how these agencies operate, the truth is that it never gets to the bottom of the issue, or proposes public control of the financial sector, so as not to threaten the interests of large companies and financial institutions."
"This is a key issue."
"We therefore call for effective regulation of the financial sector, and putting a stop to the liberalisation of capital movements, to tax havens, to derivatives, and to CRAs and their operations."
"We know - as it has indeed been demonstrated over the last few years - that credit rating agencies (CRAs) are not credible, but their actions, nonetheless, remain very damaging, especially to countries with weaker economies, and they make a living, above all, from disproportionately stimulating credit and capitalist financial speculation."
"They are, above all, the result of the financialisation of the economy - that do not translate or correspond to actual increases in productive activity - and they constitute a central part of neoliberalism's development strategy, which is always seeking levels of profit that real production cannot ensure."
"While this report makes some criticisms of how these agencies operate, the truth is that it never gets to the bottom of the issue, or proposes public control of the financial sector, so as not to threaten the interests of large companies and financial institutions."
"We therefore call for effective regulation of the financial sector, and putting a stop to the liberalisation of capital movements, to tax havens, to derivatives, and to CRAs and their operations."
"We need a different fiscal policy that contributes to economic growth, social justice and balanced public accounts, so that it may contribute to the end of the tax benefits available in tax havens, to the taxation of profits made on the stock exchange, and to the introduction of an additional tax on the profits of large companies and financial institutions."
"This report refers to extremely important issues regarding the rating sector, including the lack of competition, the oligopolistic structure and a lack of accountability and transparency, especially in the rating of government debt."
"In my opinion, it is therefore essential to take steps to create a European Credit Rating Agency, which could work towards a new model of credit rating and create the conditions for developing genuine competitiveness."
"It would be a good thing if credit rating agencies were to be more accountable in future."
"The truth is that the agencies gave the highest possible rating to many complex financial instruments, toxic instruments, as we were later to learn."
"The report recommends that there should be more and better risk analysis by market players so that they do not have to rely too much on the credit rating agencies."
"Almost the entire market for credit ratings, which are sometimes made compulsory for regulatory purposes, is controlled by three large US agencies."
"Opening up this industry to competition, or creating a European public agency, will not change the perversity of the system."
"It is now madder than ever."
"No one knows which market or which agency directs the reactions of the other; whether one country's poor rating triggers panic over sovereign debt, or whether cynical speculation leads to a poor rating; whether a good rating has an impact on certain assets being held onto or whether, because they are good and one wants to hold onto them, the assets are rated favourably."
"Monitoring the activity of agencies more closely offers only a minimum service and obviously does not go far enough."
"Despite the repeated criticisms they have received in Europe and the US, the reputation of agencies has not really suffered."
"There is no doubt that holding them legally and even financially accountable for the consequences of their mistakes and their irresponsible evaluations would have an impact."
"Yet again, nothing will be resolved without fundamentally changing the system instead of trying to patch it up to guarantee its survival."
"By approving Mr Klinz's report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets."
"It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector: the lack of competition, the regulatory over-dependence on ratings, and the low reliability of notes."
"In this vein, Parliament's request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant."
"Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn."
"I welcomed this document because the credit rating industry has various problems, the most serious of which are oligopolistic structures and the lack of competition, accountability and transparency."
"For the dominant credit rating agencies (CRAs) in particular, the payment model is a problem, while the regulatory system's key problem is over-reliance on external credit ratings."
"As you know, CRAs rate three different sectors - the public sector, companies and structured finance instruments."
"There is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements."
"I see the need to increase supervisors' responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models and for imposing prudential measures."
"I believe that credit ratings must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment of credit risk across sectors and countries, and consider it important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs."
"In this respect, it is necessary to highlight the central role of increased transparency in their activities."
"I firmly believe that we must support the establishment of new CRAs while avoiding any distortions of competition."
"The resolution voted on today sets out a series of measures to reduce the current dependency on a very few ratings sources."
"As well as an increase in competition, these measures include greater and judicious use of internal credit ratings, particularly by large financial institutions that are capable of performing their own risk assessments."
"We were certainly somewhat divided on this subject during the initial phases, but in our final positions, we were substantially in agreement."
"Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor."
"We Swedish Social Democrats today supported the call for the Commission to carry out a more detailed investigation of the conditions for establishing a European Credit Rating Foundation or a public European credit rating agency."
"We can see that a politically created credit rating body could be a way of putting pressure on the large private agencies."
"At the same time, we can see the potential problems."
"It would therefore be beneficial to get a better picture of both the advantages and disadvantages of such a body with the aid of a detailed study."
"A better knowledge base is a prerequisite for further discussion of this matter."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the credit rating agencies industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs."
"The report suggests ways of dealing with each of these problems."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted the three main problems involving credit rating agencies: lack of competition, due to the scarce importance of rating agencies in global capital markets, as well as the inability to compete, particularly in terms of regulatory standards; over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework for formulating standards, laws and regulations (for example, their increasingly frequent use in determining capital requirements) as well as Central Bank reliance on external credit ratings; and, lastly, the absence of liability for credit rating agencies in relation to the ratings they provide, in which regard the report also proposes to foster the establishment of a European network of credit rating agencies."
"We agree, in this vein, with the importance of more widespread information for investors and that market participants should only be authorised to invest in derivative financial instruments if they can prove to have an understanding and ability to assess the credit risk that the product carries."
"Lastly, we support the idea of establishing a fully-independent, non-public European Credit Rating Foundation (ECRF)."
"This hypocritical text claims that the main problem with credit rating agencies is that they hamper competition."
"Its solution to the 'over-reliance' of banks on these agencies is that the banks assess the risks themselves."
"Banks responsible for measuring austerity!"
"If they are unable to do so, they are asked to apply the least favourable rating to offer themselves the greatest protection. The problem is not protecting the interests of banks but protecting the general interest."
"Once again, the people are last on the EU's list of priorities."
"Credit rating agencies (CRAs) fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information on the credit quality of issuers, enabling issuers to access global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, thus providing markets with liquidity."
"However, the recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs."
"We must pay attention to the potential measures to be taken."
"These should undergo the necessary impact assessments and scrutiny, and should not be a shot from the hip, which could be counterproductive, increasing the barriers to entry into the markets and the risk of more conservative ratings, with subsequent effects on the real economy and lending."
"We must view this industry from a global perspective, as it is a true worldwide industry with an underlying global capital market."
"We must therefore stay up-to-date with developments in the United States."
"in writing. - This own-initiative report raises the main current issues concerning the credit rating industry, amongst which, the most important are the lack of competition, oligopolistic structures and the lack of accountability and transparency, notably regarding the rating of the sovereign debt."
"I consider it to be very timely."
"It is necessary to do our best not to repeat the situation which happened with Greece."
"I voted in favour."
"Credit rating agencies are supposed to provide information about the quality of credit."
"Hitherto, however, these agencies have earned themselves a dishonourable reputation."
"Thus, for example, their delayed reaction to the financial crisis of the 1930s was roundly criticised."
"The experts in the credit rating agencies even failed to spot the rotten financial structures in the US property market as a risk."
"Likewise, when state debts began to rise, they only reacted when investors started to express their worries, responding with such harshness that the financial problems of individual countries were exacerbated."
"There is something terribly wrong with the system as a whole if the Greek irregularities and the Goldman-Sachs swap to conceal debt were known in the market for many years, if it was common for Athens to revise its budget data as soon as a new government came to power and the state was still given a good credit rating, only provoking a sudden, sharp response when the financial and economic crisis happened, causing bankruptcies, penalising states whose banks backed precarious loans, while, at the same time, betting a lot of money on countries going bankrupt."
"This proposal can only be the first step in the right direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"I believe that the activities of credit rating agencies are generally extremely dubious."
"This is not just because they do not identify risks in good time, as in the case of the US real estate market, but also because they can make a bad situation worse after a crisis occurs."
"We cannot allow private US rating agencies to decide arbitrarily on the creditworthiness of European states."
"This report is a step in the direction of more stringent controls on credit rating agencies, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"I welcome this resolution on the future perspectives of credit rating agencies."
"The credit rating industry often experiences problems relating to oligopolistic structures and a lack of competition, accountability and transparency."
"Consequently, the Commission should consider the possibility of establishing a completely new, independent European Credit Rating Foundation (ECRF), which would have the right to participate in decisions on sovereign debt ratings and credit rating agencies."
"The management, staff and governance structure of the new ECRF would be fully independent and autonomous."
"I welcome the proposal that CRAs' exposure to civil liability in the event of gross negligence or misconduct be defined on a consistent basis across the EU."
"Furthermore, there is a need to increase supervisors' responsibilities, capacity, powers and resources for monitoring, assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models, for imposing prudential measures and conducting investigations and inspections."
"It is very important to create a level playing field for credit rating agencies by stimulating competition, transparency, market opening and stability."
"The work done by credit rating agencies (CRAs) is important since it ensures reliability and stability."
"Hence, we need to establish rules and standards governing their ratings and their impartiality."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Klinz because I think it is essential for the European Union to have adequate rules to manage the impact of ratings on the overall financial and economic system."
"Notwithstanding the legal vacuum in this area and the possibility for these agencies to affect Member States' economies - even to the extent of plunging them into crises - this report does appear to be the first step towards new rules for rating agencies given the Commission's recent adoption of the new regulation on CRAs."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on credit rating agencies (CRAs) because I agree that it is essential to reduce the unfair competition caused by the CRAs' common practice of assessing market participants while simultaneously obtaining orders from them."
"I believe the Commission should carefully assess the potential use of alternative instruments to measure credit risk."
"It is vital that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) exercises its powers effectively and has the right to conduct unannounced investigations and on-site inspections."
"It is also vital that, when exercising its supervisory powers, the ESMA gives the persons subject to proceedings the opportunity of a hearing in order to respect their right to defence."
"I also agree with the call for the Commission to carry out a detailed impact study on costs, benefits and the potential governance structure of a totally independent European Credit Rating Foundation, which would be competent in the three areas of ratings."
"Although this report has some positive aspects, it was not capable of proposing the creation of a public, independent European Credit Rating Foundation."
"On the contrary, the ambiguity of the way it is written allows for the public financing of a new private agency."
"The report also fails to mention the withdrawal of sovereign debt from the agencies' ratings, which is the main measure that could be taken in this area to combat speculation against the euro."
"Finally, the report should have suggested that the Commission examine the possibility of prior European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) approval of all 'structured financial products'."
"I am voting against for these reasons."
"Through this measure, we are at last able to express our desire to improve the work of rating agencies by enhancing their transparency, integrity, responsibility, independence and reliability."
"While recognising the role of agencies in supplying information and stimulating market liquidity, it is now quite clear that financial operators have placed too much faith in their judgments and that their actions contributed to causing the financial crisis."
"There is too much dependence on external credit rating agencies and an oligopoly exists in the sector."
"I am therefore in favour of establishing an independent European Credit Rating Foundation with responsibility for ratings in the public sector, for companies and for structured finance instruments."
"The recent financial crisis has demonstrated the need to regulate credit rating agencies (CRAs)."
"Indeed, recent events have opened up the possibility of identifying the failures of their action and of re-examining their status as certifiers of the subjects of their analysis: companies, the public sector, and structured finance instruments."
"As such, it has become clear that they play an important role in reducing the asymmetries in information that could be detected between investors."
"On the other hand, however, it has been noted that there is too much confidence in the ratings assigned by CRAs, which surely contributed significantly to exacerbating the financial crisis."
"There is, therefore, an urgent need for a new regulatory model that will reduce dependence on CRA ratings."
"The solution involves measures such as limiting the dependence of the European Central Bank (ECB) on data provided by outside agencies, reinforcing the competences of regulators and supervisors, launching the debate on creating a European Credit Rating Foundation, increasing the range of information available to investors - thereby decreasing the CRAs' power - and also, for example, strengthening mechanisms for civil accountability."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Klinz."
"I call on the rating agencies to shed further light on how they determine their sovereign ratings, while also asking the sector to explain their methodologies and why their ratings diverge from the forecasts of the main international financial institutions."
"Another controversial issue is the structure to be put forward to counterbalance the three largest rating agencies at European level, which are felt to have a disproportionate influence on our market."
"Hence, I call on the Commission to carefully assess the opportunity for a completely independent credit rating foundation, which should be provided with seed funds to cover a maximum of five years."
"Lastly, it is essential to look at the ways to make rating agencies subject to civil liability for their ratings."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to identify the ways in which rating agencies could be held liable under the civil law of the Member States."
"in writing. - In favour."
"CRA ratings fulfil several useful purposes."
"They aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers in a global environment with asymmetric information between debt issuers and investors, allowing issuers to access global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, thus providing liquidity to markets and helping find prices."
"However, developments in the regulatory framework have made these 'information intermediaries' de facto 'regulatory licensors'."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs."
"The main objective of the resolution adopted today is to remove the dependence on external credit ratings from the whole system, as far and as soon as is feasibly possible."
"The role of external ratings as hard triggers is particularly significant when downgrading from investment grade to sub investment grade."
"In a competitive and well-functioning market, the reputation of an agency is enough to ensure the quality of its ratings."
"However, since credit rating agencies currently operate in an oligopoly, they benefit from an intrinsically 'guaranteed' market."
"I voted in favour of the Klinz report because I consider that the measures that it proposes to address the problems that exist in the credit rating service sector are a move in the right direction."
"These services have a massive impact and the results of their activities may be catastrophic for the states and organisations which they rate, as we saw very clearly in the recent financial crisis."
"Clear operating rules need to be laid down for these services, the rating procedures they use need to be disclosed and they need to take responsibility."
"The states and all manner of services and organisations which they rate cannot be left at the mercy of their decisions."
"The three principal rating agencies rate 95% of economic activities; we are therefore talking about a monopoly, with all the adverse repercussions that can have."
"We are calling for transparency, restrictions on illegal activities, assumption of responsibility, evaluation of these agencies by independent bodies that will guarantee their impartiality and strict application of the rules."
"I support the Klinz report in order to advance the process of reforming the rating agencies."
"While the first legislative initiative made these agencies subject to regulation and supervision and the second clarified the supervisory powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), this resolution advocates decreasing regulatory dependence on external ratings, structuring the industry in a competition framework and improving its business models in line with the criteria of the Financial Stability Forum."
"The final text includes my amendments."
"With these amendments, I intended to strengthen the capacity of the supervisory authorities, promote a level playing field globally, increase competition by avoiding rating shopping and establish standard procedures for disseminating information."
"On the subject of sovereign debt, I advocated that the rating agencies should avoid pro-cyclicality in their work and take into account the forecasts of the main international financial institutions."
"I also called for proposals from the Commission to reform the payment models and to impose accountability for misconduct."
"Finally, I very much welcome the fact that the report considers the establishment of an independent European rating agency and the possibility of a European foundation."
"in writing. - I support this report which recognises that credit rating agencies lack accountability, competition and transparency, notably with regard to sovereign debt."
"More needs to be done at an EU and global level to ensure that reckless practices do not endanger the financial security of the EU."
"Credit rating agencies (CRAs) are information middlemen that promote liquidity and transparency in the market by reducing asymmetries in information in the capital markets and facilitating access to the global market, and by reducing the cost of information and making use of the potential of creditors and investors."
"However, these agencies present certain problems, in particular, concerning their lack of competition, their oligopolistic structures, the excessive trust placed in them, and their lack of transparency and accountability."
"Such issues are becoming more important at the present time, not least as regards Member States that, because of their economic and financial difficulties, are seeing the ratings of various national institutions fluctuating inconsistently and cyclically."
"While the importance of CRAs cannot be denied, it would be advisable to limit their role in the future."
"I therefore voted for the proposal tabled by Parliament to call on the Commission to carry out an impact study, and an analysis of the costs, benefits and governance structure of a European Credit Rating Foundation competent in the various areas of ratings: the public sector, companies and finance instruments."
"in writing. - This report will introduce tougher oversight of credit rating agencies by the new European Supervisory Authority on Securities and Markets (ESMA) this summer, which will prove an important tool in ensuring that the previous laissez-faire attitude to lending will not be able to continue in the wake of the financial crisis."
"Credit rating agencies were earning fees, from financial institutions, for awarding ratings on their products, and from the resulting business of selling those products."
"This conflict meant agencies were keen to give high ratings to complex financial instruments, which led to investor complacency when buying these products."
"Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk, and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors, including pension holders across Wales."
"The financial and economic crisis has thrown a critical light on credit rating agencies and, in particular, their active role in the continuing crisis, the core problems identified being a lack of competition, excessive dependency on external credit ratings and a lack of answerability in the sector."
"For this reason, the rapporteur recommends examining the idea of setting up a genuinely independent European credit rating agency, stating that the new European Credit Rating Foundation must be self-sustaining."
"Because of the far-reaching consequences of ratings, intensive interaction with this sector is unavoidable."
"This is why I have voted in favour of the report."
"The financial crisis of recent years has highlighted the three main problems in the sector: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework, and no liability for credit rating agencies in relation to the ratings they issue."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Klinz because I think establishing a completely independent, non-public European Credit Rating Foundation is a sensible and attractive idea."
"I am voting for this report as I believe it is essential that we confront failures to comply with international social legislation both inside and outside Europe; these constitute forms of social and environmental dumping that are damaging to European companies and workers."
"It is to be hoped that this report can reinforce the firm nucleus of the work parameters incorporated in International Labour Organisation (ILO) legislation."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"It should be stressed that the external dimension of social policy includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-member countries."
"This includes opportunities for men and women to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equality, security and dignity."
"International labour standards should, above all, ensure the development of people as human beings."
"People are not goods whose price can be negotiated."
"Work is a part of our everyday lives and is critical for the dignity, welfare and development of a person."
"The EU has a good reputation in terms of international dialogue on social issues."
"In this regard, it is considered a sensitive and trusted partner."
"This must be used to achieve more ambitious goals set by the EU."
"One of them is to build a coherent, integrated and professional EU approach to the external dimension of social policy."
"Coordination within the European Parliament is key, as is coordination with the European Commission and the newly established External Action Service."
"The external dimension of social policy includes European Union activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries."
"The protection of economic and social rights is an obligation for all Member States arising from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"This is why the attitude of all European Union Member States has to reflect clearly the principles of the European social model when social issues and cooperation among the Member States are at stake."
"I would like to emphasise that the European social model offers equal opportunities in education, training and the labour market, as well as equal access to social services as major pillars of economic success."
"This is why I encourage Member States to support the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution which supports the dignity, welfare and development of every person as values which ought to be the main objectives of economic development."
"in writing. - The report on the external dimension of social policy relates to a priority for the EU social policies."
"It calls for the strengthening of the core labour standards embedded in the ILO conventions, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour."
"I voted in favour of this report because it also calls for a change in governance, globally and in the EU, in order to better implement workers' rights and working conditions."
"I supported the report by our fellow Member, Mr Falbr, because I believe that the Union should promote the highest labour and social standards in third countries to maintain its credibility in international trade and to build strong ties with the main trade partners."
"The rapporteur recommends balanced relationships with NGOs and international organisations to facilitate the ratification of conventions."
"To be in a position to negotiate with the Union, third countries must comply with internationally established labour standards."
"The International Labour Organisation's latest reading of the matter is that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work - one of the worst forms of child labour - that puts the child's life and health at risk."
"With the World Day Against Child Labour on 12 June approaching, I voted in favour of this important and timely report which invites stakeholders of the Free Trade Agreement to commit, in line with the ILO's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, to the elimination of all kinds of forced labour and the ending of child labour."
"Child labour and the organised violation of human rights must not be ignored when trade agreements are under discussion and the EU must take a strong position in promoting social policy and labour and social standards in trade negotiations."
"The external dimension of social policy includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-member countries."
"The EU has set itself the objective of not only becoming a pole of excellence on corporate social responsibility (CSR) but also of promoting CSR in its external policies."
"Failure to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to European enterprises and workers."
"I agree that it is necessary to enhance the role of the relevant international institutions such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations, and to seek their cooperation in the development, implementation and promotion of basic international social standards."
"Our globalised world, in which countries are interlinked by economic, social, cultural and political relationships, is an undeniable reality."
"However, as regards trade relations between the European Union and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions."
"The European Union, as a trade partner and important negotiating partner at global level, should help promote higher labour and social standards in third countries."
"I therefore voted for this report, which underlines the crucial role that the EU can play regarding human rights, especially through the right to a decent job."
"Having a homogenous formula for a social clause that could be inserted in all bilateral trade agreements is what is proposed in the report that we have just adopted on the external dimension of social policy and the promotion of social standards."
"This initiative is actually a step in the right direction."
"Observing the fact that free trade agreements still generally contain few references to social standards, the report mentions a number of avenues, including the social clause and compliance with International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions - whether or not they have been ratified already by all Member States. - and enhancing cooperation between third countries and Member States."
"Developing the concept of corporate social responsibility is the other interesting aspect of the report because, although it is currently a useful concept, it is still based on voluntary participation and therefore has room for improvement."
"As well as extending the concept to several areas and incorporating this CSA dimension into our trade polices, why not one day make it binding?"
"Over and above political signalling, this would be a real step forward in achieving our social policy objectives."
"The external dimension of social policy includes the European Union's initiatives to promote labour and social standards in non-Member States."
"By setting labour standards, the European Union fosters the possibility for citizens to obtain work in conditions of freedom, equality, safety and dignity."
"Considering the present globalisation of the world economy, international labour standards are the foundation on which a country's social and economic development should be built."
"China, India and other emerging economies are becoming increasingly important players in terms of foreign investments."
"This phenomenon is nevertheless associated with the risk that these countries - and, in particular, their companies - will export labour standards below those of the European Union."
"I therefore believe that the European Union should be watchful of countries that wish to conclude trade agreements with us."
"Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises lead the way in translating social standards into reality."
"I take the view that it is vital to have a clear and unambiguous definition of corporate social responsibility that will do away with the current assortment of interpretations, while also establishing ways to check that these responsibilities are met."
"I decided to vote in favour of Mr Falbr's report which, on the one hand, captures the strategic importance of corporate social responsibility as a motivational tool to stimulate business growth and, on the other, underlines that this issue can only be tackled on a voluntary basis."
"I also completely agreed with Mr Falbr's critical approach, whereby he disapproves of the hypocritical behaviour of the European Union simultaneously promoting a social model that fosters social rights while also entering into commercial agreements with countries that do not respect or provide protection for workers."
"I voted in favour of this report because there are still cases where the conventions and agreements of the International Labour Organisation are not properly implemented or only partially implemented and the principles of corporate social responsibility are violated."
"International labour standards should, above all, ensure workers' rights, because work is a part of our daily lives and is critical for the dignity, welfare and development of a person."
"As well as social standards, corporate social responsibility should contribute to sustainable growth, but companies should not avoid dialogue with employees and they must respect and promote decent employment relations, encourage employee participation through consultation and information and through collective bargaining, develop vocational skills and lifelong learning, comply with work safety standards, promote equality of men and women, create a proper environment for social partners to anticipate and manage changes that have taken place in the labour market, including restructuring, improve the quality of work, and integrate and protect vulnerable groups of workers, such as young people, the elderly, disabled people and migrants."
"The European Union should therefore continue to use sanctions and incentives in bilateral and regional agreements in order to ensure the implementation of the social provisions of EU agreements."
"Furthermore, it is very important for the governments themselves not to retreat from their responsibility to maintain the European social model because then, there is the threat of the privatisation of employment law and social security systems and services."
"The external dimension of social policy includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries."
"Although both the Lisbon strategy and the EU 2020 strategy attach greater emphasis than ever before to social policy, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority to the detriment of social issues."
"Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions which focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour."
"In order for the EU to negotiate with third countries, they must comply with all the abovementioned requirements."
"This is a mandatory condition for negotiations with third countries."
"Trade policy cannot ignore failure to respect workers' rights and, therefore, the development of society may continue only after these shortcomings have been removed."
"The EU has a good reputation in terms of international dialogue on social issues."
"In this regard, it is considered a sensitive and trusted partner."
"This must be used to achieve more ambitious goals set by the EU."
"The report focuses on a topic that is enormously important in today's world. This is the question of workers' rights."
"So-called social dumping represents a major threat for workers as it undermines their rights in a fundamental way."
"International companies are the main players when it comes to applying social standards."
"It is therefore absolutely essential to define the social responsibility of companies clearly and unambiguously so that we can limit the number of differing interpretations and establish minimum obligations in this area, as well as a method for monitoring their fulfilment."
"Many firms come into regions only for the temporary financial advantage, mostly because of cheap labour."
"Companies generally refuse to establish long-term links in a region, and therefore to participate in shared social responsibility in the region."
"The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour."
"It demands changes in the global administration system and in the EU, with the aim of better protection of workers' rights and employment conditions."
"The rapporteurs have managed to defend a clear social dimension in the submitted report, and I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I voted against the application of an external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"This is because, in my opinion, the EU should refrain from imposing social prerogatives on third countries, however correct or beneficial they may deem them to be."
"Whilst I accept the importance of fostering humane methods of treating a workforce, social policy in the EU has already wreaked havoc on a number of UK institutions and should not be extended."
"A degree of flexibility and freedom is needed when dealing with social policy, as one-size-fits-all policy making can be counterproductive when applied at domestic level."
"For this reason, the EU should not be seeking to acquire competence over social policy at all."
"I welcome EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries, which constitute a guarantee that the growth of the global economy will benefit everyone in the current globalised context."
"I therefore support the conditions based on social values and human dignity imposed on third countries in order to negotiate with the EU."
"It is through this type of Union that we will successfully use foreign policy to improve the situation in the world."
"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) plays a key role in the international system, as it contributes to building a consensus on labour standards."
"A significant part of this important acquis is recognised by all EU Member States."
"However, there remain differences in terms of labour legislation between developed and developing countries."
"In my opinion, it is imperative for the EU that these standards with those of third countries be reconciled, particularly with key trade partners, so as to preserve a basic level of equality in international trade."
"This report shares this belief, setting out some strategies for these countries to respect the same principles as the EU in labour terms."
"The establishment of fair standards for working conditions is a premise essential to durable and sustainable development, and will also contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"I therefore believe that this report is a fairly valid contribution to the development of the system of international trade, which is based on labour relations that vary so much between countries/trade blocs."
"I would argue that the promotion of this policy of responsibility for working conditions demonstrates a Europe that is attentive and thorough, and that conforms to defending universal values in which it believes."
"One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development."
"If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place."
"This perspective - which some people also call the social market economy - is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being."
"Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy, including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility."
"This approach and vision cannot, and must not, have an impact merely within the EU, but must also be applied to external action wherever possible, particularly during the negotiation of agreements."
"Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions."
"I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives."
"in writing. - The external dimension of social policy includes activities and initiatives of the EU aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-member countries."
"The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens."
"Given the globalisation of industry and services, international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all."
"This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker's rights and working conditions, calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour."
"The external dimension of social policy is aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries and at combating social dumping, often the result of globalisation or international trade."
"The Union can no longer tolerate dumping in terms of welfare, health and the environment without reacting to it, as it is responsible for far too many transfers of production outside Europe."
"The ridiculously low labour costs and despicable working conditions should no longer be seen by the Commission as 'natural competitive advantages'."
"On this point, I insist that the Commission changes its doctrine."
"I voted in favour of the Falbr report because, with the role of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) having recently been downgraded, I think we need to remember the importance of respecting the social rights of workers in the world."
"The European Union should play a leading role on the world stage to force other countries to respect international standards in labour law and thus limit the frantic quest for social dumping."
"It is important for all European players to be involved in the implementation of this policy, be it governments involved in concluding international agreements, or European companies expanding their business into third countries."
"The external dimension of the social policy is aimed at promoting core social standards in third countries in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and to ensure that workers are protected through compliance with international labour standards."
"The EU is far from being outdone and that is why it should be able to benefit from its credibility and its 'good reputation' in this regard, with a view to establishing social alliances with its main trading partners and promoting these at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
"Before we let these third countries sit at the same negotiating table as the EU, we must demand that they subscribe to the same core international labour standards."
"The overseas dimension of European policy is not limited to establishing agreements or overseas aid."
"It is more than that."
"In particular, it involves bringing European values to third countries, not just in terms of democratisation and greater respect for fundamental rights, but also of promoting active policies to protect the environment, and the rights of women and children, and of labour standards that respect personal dignity and enable personal development."
"The same can be said for promoting social responsibility standards for companies in third countries."
"This report by Mr Falbr concerns the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"The European Union has been a bastion of the defence of workers' social rights, respect for which is a sine qua non for negotiations with third countries."
"Despite the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, according to the ILO itself, more than 50% of workers do not enjoy social rights, in particular, immigrants, women and children."
"It is in the EU's interests to promote personal dignity and respect for social rights in all the Member States, creating, for that purpose, a mechanism for finding out who is not offering these rights to their workers and penalising them."
"I welcome this report and am voting for it."
"Whilst arguing for the importance of values in a globalising world increasingly dominated by economics, it advocates personal dignity, does not accept the exploitation of individuals, promotes welfare and personal integrated development, and calls on the EU to comply with ILO standards."
"This is yet another enunciation of just concerns and criticisms that, unfortunately, does not get to the bottom of the issues and, for this very reason, ends up being largely inconsequential."
"The 2010 World Social Security Report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) mentions that more than 50% of workers lack social protection."
"It is in this context that the European Union is implementing a trade policy based on the zealous championing of free trade, which is achieved through the negotiation and conclusion of innumerable bilateral and regional agreements."
"Far from encouraging 'corporate social responsibility', which is, in practice, non-existent, these agreements only protect the profits of large companies and financial institutions, and do not give the proper attention to labour rights, to the importance of collective bargaining and workers' freedom of association, to the effective elimination of discrimination in respect of employment, to the elimination of forced labour, to insecure and poorly paid work, or to child labour."
"This is just an example of an aspect that the report could and should have taken much further."
"It was important to make the European Commission accountable, and demand it provide consistency on policy and action, and a series of effective actions promoting social and labour standards."
"This report contains some positive aspects: the denouncing of multinationals' constant disrespect for workers' rights and decent work, and the need to horizontally integrate social policy in all European Union external policy, including so-called corporate social responsibility (CSR)."
"However, the positive aspects are diluted by the failure to demand the implementation of alternative policies that effectively oblige companies to realise their CSR."
"We therefore regret that the call for point 31 - 'Stresses that no directive regulating CSR and enforcing respect for it should be adopted at EU level' - to be removed has been rejected."
"Parliament should go further than 'requesting' or 'encouraging' the Commission to adopt a position and demand the creation of a legislative framework on CSR, with minimum standards that promote respect for the core labour standards advocated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in multinational companies and in the European Union itself, and include decent jobs and social clauses both in any bilateral trade agreements that the European Union negotiates and within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) itself."
"For all these reasons, we voted against the report."
"The external dimension of social policy is one of the key priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"It is essential to strengthen employment standards, such as freedom of association, collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, discrimination in employment and occupations and the abolition of child labour."
"The objective and the endeavour of international employment standards should therefore be to direct economic development particularly towards improving human life and dignity, and not just to establish the conditions and rights of workers."
"Globalisation is, in fact, only serving to pit the workers of all countries against each other in unfair competition, whether through relocations, the immigration of job-seekers or the infamous General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4."
"The problem is that the European Union produces lots of fine talk on the subject but never puts it into practice."
"When have we ever taken practical and specific action as a consequence of coming across situations of intolerable exploitation?"
"When have such situations ever prevented the signing of trade agreements with a country?"
"Never."
"Because while you pretend to be concerned about foreign workers, European workers are being excluded from the picture."
"As the rapporteur - who subscribes to this - points out, 'labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes' according to the international bodies!"
"So then, what principles, what values, what considerations could ever challenge the absolute power of the market?"
"You talk a lot about the social responsibility of companies who, after all, are only playing by the rules that you have put in place."
"When will the issue of the very heavy social responsibility of the EU's political deciders finally be addressed here?"
"The economic and financial crisis which is presently raging in Europe, but also in the rest of the world, is combined with a serious social crisis."
"In this difficult context, the European Union and its businesses have a substantial social responsibility in the relations they maintain with third countries."
"For this reason, I was keen to stress, through my vote, the need for the European Union to ensure that social standards and workers' rights are adhered to when signing agreements with these countries."
"The European Union, through the values it enshrines, must ensure that the standards governing its labour law are promoted and disseminated all over the world."
"Europe has a duty to be a model."
"That is why I also voted in favour of provisions which emphasise corporate social responsibility."
"I welcomed this document because, at the turn of the century, the EU changed its strategy for the external dimension of social policy from a hard to a soft approach, i.e. from focusing on linking social standards with trade agreements to focusing rather on international cooperation and dialogue."
"The EU uses different types of instruments to implement social policy in non-member countries."
"These are hard, soft and financial instruments."
"The use of these instruments is proof that the EU expects certain behaviour in its relations with its trading partners."
"Nevertheless, the stumbling block is the implementation of these instruments and their enforcement in partner countries."
"It is therefore crucial for the EU to focus more thoroughly on their implementation and enforcement, especially the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and the principles of corporate social responsibility."
"This is often hindered by the country's legal order; however, weak political will and internal economic pressure are also at play."
"The fact that workers do not know their rights is another important factor."
"in writing. - According to the report, the EU has a unique combination of economic dynamism with a social model."
"It creates equal opportunities in education, training and the labour market and equal access to social services."
"The report stresses the fact that there is a need for implementation of decent work programmes that reflect national needs and priorities regarding employment and social policy, and are based on agreement between employers, workers and governments."
"This aspect is very important in the actual context."
"These are several of the reasons why I endorse this report."
"People matter most, and that is why it is so important to promote employment and social standards."
"People living in rural areas and, in particular, women and young people, are a good example."
"The overwhelming majority of farms are owned by men."
"I believe that women should be supported to ensure that this imbalance is corrected."
"In my opinion, it is also important to support young farmers who take over farms from their parents."
"As far as young people are concerned, the quality of education in rural areas should be improved, and young people should be guaranteed access to non-rural opportunities for learning and personal development."
"The next key issue is corporate social responsibility."
"This means that businesses take action on a day-to-day basis to protect society and the environment, on their own initiative and irrespective of any legal regulations."
"Businesses are no longer only geared towards profit."
"They are starting to be characterised by an ever-greater awareness of social and environmental protection issues."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility - towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large."
"A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)."
"This is - and should remain - a voluntary matter."
"In our globalised markets, CSR entails much more than making a donation to the local football club."
"Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy."
"They are Europe's ambassadors to the world, flying the flag for Europe's social standards worldwide."
"We should support CSR, not regulate it."
"In this case, Europe's role should be that of a moderator, not a regulator."
"This principle must be applied if the European Commission is to get serious and take up the topic of CSR once again: we do not need excessive regulation."
"We have underlined this position with this report."
"I believe that Mr Falbr has drafted a good report, and so I would like to explain why I decided to vote in favour of its adoption."
"The promotion of high labour standards, social standards and corporate social responsibility represents an extremely large challenge for the external dimension of social policy."
"One of the problems which the rapporteur highlights is the inefficiency of the administrative bodies responsible for employment policy."
"Ongoing and constructive cooperation with third countries, involving both the European Union as a whole and the individual Member States, may serve as a source of good practices in terms of establishing the appropriate administrative capabilities."
"I believe that cooperation at regional and local levels and with businesses also yields good results."
"An excellent example of partnership, support and exchange of experience which has yielded positive results is the cooperation between Polish regions and the countries in the Eastern Partnership over the last few years."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the external dimension of the European Union's social policy."
"The European Union is seen around the world as an attractive and sought-after partner, and this owes much to the unique way in which it combines economic dynamism with a social model."
"The latter should be promoted by the EU in its relations with other countries and should involve consistent action between the two dimensions, internal and external."
"The current text insists on the need to promote corporate social responsibility in particular."
"The latter requires trading companies to take into consideration the social and environmental dimensions."
"The resolution highlights that this promotion should not be binding, but rather should be the result of interaction between the stakeholders on a voluntary basis."
"Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers, which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending, as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account."
"in writing. - I welcome this report."
"Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour."
"It is clear not only from these conventions but also from the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation that it is necessary to change the narrow focus on markets into a wider interest in people, i.e. focus on the protection of workers' rights and the rule of labour law."
"In order for the EU to negotiate with non-member countries, the latter must respect all the abovementioned."
"This is a condition without which negotiations with non-member countries are impossible."
"Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers' rights, and the development of society may therefore only continue after these drawbacks are removed."
"By setting labour standards, the EU supports opportunities for men and women to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equality, security and dignity."
"Given the current globalisation, international labour standards are the basis which guarantees that the growth of the global economy will benefit all."
"The aim and much of the content of Mr Falbr's report is, in my view, very positive."
"I also consider the focus on employment and decent working conditions to be a key element of sustainable development, and not just in EU countries."
"Like the rapporteur, I regret that there is no single definition of a 'social clause' which would be usable not in bilateral trade agreements, but in the creation of decent employment conditions for workers."
"The social models of some European countries could also serve as a good example to developing countries."
"I also share the opinion on the joint fight to eliminate child labour."
"Despite the above, I abstained from the vote because it is impossible to implement social demands in bilateral trade agreements in the absence of a clear definition of respect for human rights."
"This criterion must not be used as an argument against the signing of agreements."
"'That the spirit of revolutionary change which has long been disturbing the nations of the world should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the related sphere of practical economics is not surprising'."
"These are the words of the beloved Pope John Paul II who, in his encyclical entitled Centesimus Annus, reprised the subjects tackled by his predecessor Leo XIII in the encyclical Rerum Novarum."
"His purpose in doing so was to analyse and contribute to the social 'question' which - today as in 1991 - can only be resolved by referring to Christian doctrine and, hence, by recognising the absolutely indiscriminate dignity of the human being and the worker."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Falbr since it focuses precisely on the importance of safeguarding human rights and the fact that the European social model is an important starting point, including in terms of the Union's external relations."
"Social responsibility must work to this end and the European Union - working through Parliament - must restore and reinforce these principles in its every action, above all in dealing with non-Member States whose citizens are denied fundamental rights."
"As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I feel compelled to underline how important it is that we all cooperate, including outside the EU, to eliminate gender discrimination and gender violence so as to restore the social dignity of women and revive their active contribution to the local and supranational economy alike."
"The globalisation of the economy and the relocation of European companies have led to concerns regarding the external dimension of social policy."
"This includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries."
"Core labour standards are embedded in the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour."
"In order for third countries to negotiate with the EU, they must respect all the ideas outlined above."
"This is a condition without which negotiations with third countries are impossible."
"Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers' rights and the development of society may continue only after such obstacles have been removed."
"It is essential to use international labour standards to ensure economic development remains very focused on improving human life and personal dignity, and not on determining conditions and rights of workers."
"in writing. - The external dimension of social policy is a key priority for our group and for me."
"We have recently adopted a resolution concerning the future convention on domestic workers to be adopted in June 2011."
"This report calls more generally for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in ILO conventions, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour."
"The S&D Group demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement workers' rights and working conditions."
"The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to European enterprises and workers."
"I voted in favour."
"I support the principles set down in the report."
"However, I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality."
"We already have countless trade agreements that make no demands in terms of adherence to social standards."
"As long as this obvious discrepancy exists, the effectiveness and rationale of this report will necessarily be limited."
"The report calls on the Member States to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries."
"Should not this also extend to businesses outside of Europe?"
"It also seems to me that the report claims to combat the negative effects of globalisation, although, in the final analysis, this cannot be achieved with the measures discussed here."
"For that reason, I have abstained from voting."
"In this report, the European Union has set itself very ambitious targets based on well-conceived principles."
"The Member States are being called on to implement core labour law standards for businesses in their own countries."
"Unfortunately, this call does not seem to extend to businesses outside of Europe at present."
"Although I am in favour of the principles behind the report, I do not believe its conclusions are absolutely correct, which is why I abstained from voting."
"The European Union's external social policy, targeted at countries not wishing to join the EU, should, first and foremost, be coherent, pragmatic and uniform."
"Both internal and external social policy should promote labour standards and also social standards, which are among the EU's most important objectives."
"In connection with the above, all Member States concluding agreements with third countries should ensure that their position aligns with the European social model."
"We should demand that countries not wishing to join the EU respect the right of association and that they take steps to prevent discrimination on the grounds of gender or age."
"The elimination of child labour and citizens' right to improve their professional qualifications are very significant issues."
"As far as development cooperation is concerned, the European Union has enough funds to create sufficient structures in the field of vocational education and training."
"It is absolutely crucial for the European Commission to make adjustments for the current situation and realities of life in the country in question when negotiating partnership agreements."
"The European Parliament has gained new competences since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it should cooperate actively with European and international trade unions in order to improve the social situation."
"I voted in favour of the report on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"Our objective is to promote labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility outside the EU."
"This is a legitimate objective; however, I have certain reservations as to whether we shall be able to achieve this objective."
"The common social standards that we cite are at risk and the intention to promote different social and labour standards within the EU itself is now becoming clear."
"The standards that apply in my country, in Greece, where unemployment rates among 25-year-olds are 36.1% and in Spain, where this rate is 43%, are very different from the standards that apply in the strong European economies."
"This report reminds us that, if the EU wishes to become a leader in the world in terms of social policy, it needs to safeguard cohesion between the social policies applied in its Member States."
"I voted for this report on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility."
"Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy place unprecedented emphasis on social policy, competitiveness issues and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues."
"It is essential to defend our labour standards, which are embedded in the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour."
"There is a need to focus on the protection of workers' rights and the rule of labour law."
"In order for third countries to negotiate with the EU, they must respect all the ideas outlined above."
"This should be a condition for negotiations with third countries."
"Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers' rights, and the development of society may continue only after such obstacles have been removed."
"The external dimension of the European Union's social policy aims to promote social standards in non-member countries, but the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social and labour issues."
"There are currently eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that have been ratified by all EU Member States."
"These should lead to the creation of a bedrock of international rules shared by all Member States."
"In general, we still need to focus on people as human beings, which can be achieved by protecting the rights of workers and the right to work."
"The ILO plays an essential role on the international scene by drawing up, promoting and translating these standards into reality."
"Businesses must also contribute to sustainable development in order to foster good conditions for workers, but the difference between developed and developing countries still lies in their systems of social protection."
"I am voting in favour of the proposal under discussion in light of the above and also in order that there may be greater promotion of labour and social standards in EU Member States and non-Member States alike, as well as respect for fundamental international labour standards."
"Core labour standards embedded in the eight ILO conventions focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, as well as the abolition of child labour."
"Consequently, greater attention must be focused on protecting workers' rights and labour legislation."
"A significant improvement needs to be made to the legal and social position of women to prevent discrimination and utilise the potential contribution from women to economic and social development."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to enforce the right not to be discriminated against, which means the right to work and equal treatment, irrespective of gender, ethnic origin, age and disability, as a key principle in the fight against poverty."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to cooperate with partner countries with the aim of placing greater emphasis on combating child labour with a view to creating instead decent jobs for adults and allowing children to receive a suitable education."
"The freedom of association for trade unions and the right to bargain collectively must be implemented without exception in order to improve and protect decent working conditions."
"in writing. - Promoting labour standards through the EU's negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries."
"By promoting higher safety standards and better pay, the EU is helping improve workers' lives."
"By insisting on better pay, the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports."
"If we allow imports into Europe from countries that do not ensure fair wages, we are effectively pricing European companies out of the market."
"It is harder for EU companies to compete with third party countries who do not observe the same safety standards and who can pay employees much lower salaries."
"However, it is important to note the dangers involved in 'soft law' approaches to labour standards."
"As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached, it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures."
"Therefore, the EU must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and, if not, then action must be taken."
"In an increasingly globalised world, it is essential that the EU make use of its international influence to ensure that workers' rights are protected in a model that respects personal dignity."
"A series of issues emerges in this context, such as choosing the appropriate instrument for the EU to exert its influence."
"Furthermore, it should not be forgotten how powerful the EU can be when we are talking about relations with a country that either wants to accede to the Union or is a beneficiary of EU aid programmes."
"Finally, in a context in which a significant part of the economy depends on multinational companies, there is also a need for organisations to be socially responsible."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The external dimension of social policy includes activities and initiatives of the EU aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-Member States."
"Although the Lisbon strategy gave - and the EU 2020 gives - to social policy an emphasis that is greater than ever before, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues."
"Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour."
"It is clear not only from these conventions but also from the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation that it is necessary to change the narrow focus on markets into a wider interest in people, i.e. focus on the protection of workers' rights and the rule of labour law."
"In order for the EU to negotiate with non-Member States, they must respect all the abovementioned issues."
"This is a condition without which negotiations with non-Member States are impossible."
"Trade policy cannot ignore any failure to respect workers' rights and therefore, the development of society may continue only after these drawbacks are removed."
"A business may say that it is socially responsible when it commits to a robust structure that is capable of taking account not only of economic outcomes, but also of the social and environmental results of its actions."
"These days, we ask not merely how businesses achieve their economic results, but also who they hire and how staff are treated."
"A responsible business is an active and aware participant in the social reality in which it operates, and makes its relationships with all the parties involved in its activities the main source of its prosperity."
"Through the report adopted today, the European Union has committed itself to taking a world-leading role on social policy by promoting its objectives on a global scale, thereby underlining the importance of the role attributed to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth."
"European businesses are the engine of the European Union's economy and that is why there must be a greater European commitment to protecting businesses in the EU, which often find themselves having to compete with unscrupulous partners."
"In addition, I am in favour of the creation of socially responsible enterprises, whose core principles are the social protection of workers, the protection of consumers and observance of transparency laws."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it emphasises the pivotal role that the European Union wants and should play with respect to third countries, especially with the EU's trading partners."
"Failure to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping to the detriment of European companies and workers."
"This is one of the points I was keen to stress in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade on this issue, for which I was rapporteur."
"However the EU cannot do everything on its own: it must cooperate more with the relevant international organisations (ILO, WTO, OECD), in particular, for combating the phenomenon of free zones, as these go against any social legislation."
"Moreover, while corporate social responsibility is currently well-established in Europe, European companies, their subsidiaries and their subcontractors play a vital role in promoting and disseminating social and labour standards around the world because of their weight in international trade."
"The Commission must encourage them in this regard, particularly by seeking and promoting best practices."
"I voted in favour of Mr Falbr's report because I consider that the promotion of corporate social responsibility in Europe needs to be increased, in a bid to respond directly to the need to defend common values and to increase solidarity and cohesion between Europeans."
"Corporate social responsibility must be the main aspect of the European social model, in a bid to boost innovation and competitiveness and contribute to employability and job creation, at a time when unemployment rates are increasing drastically and young Europeans, our sustainable force, are looking for alternatives outside the borders of Europe."
"I voted in favour of the Falbr report, which seeks to promote labour and social standards when the EU negotiates with third countries."
"The report takes as its basis a number of ILO conventions and, on the basis of these, it proposes that the EU should protect workers' rights and the rule of labour law when the EU enters into trade agreements with third countries, for example."
"The report proposes, among other things, that minimum requirements for corporate social responsibility be laid down by means of a legal framework, that the term be better defined and that fulfilment of the requirements be better monitored."
"At the same time, the report rejects the use in trade agreements of the 'MODE4 process', which allows international companies to import their own labour force, thereby circumventing the host country's social and working conditions."
"Quite apart from the fact that this puts the imported labour force in a worse position than that of the host country, it also contributes to social dumping."
"The EU currently has the power to enter into trade agreements with third countries on behalf of all of the Member States of the EU."
"I am opposed to this."
"However, as long as this remains the case, it will also be necessary to lay down requirements specifying what these trade agreements are to contain."
"in writing. - I supported this report, which precedes the Commission communication on CSR."
"I also welcome the work done by my colleague, Richard Howitt, at committee stage to produce a report that promotes the positive work that corporate social responsibility can do at European level."
"Europe is a basic player in globalised procedures and bears an important share of responsibility for producing results that contribute to viable forms of development."
"The European Union is at the vanguard in promoting social policies at global level and calls on developing countries to respect WTO contracts."
"The Falbr report also mentions the importance of corporate social responsibility and compliance with it by companies in the EU, given that their assumption of corporate social responsibility makes a decisive contribution in promoting social prosperity and environmental protection and in combating poverty in countries in which they are active."
"That is why I voted for the report."
"in writing. - The EU 2020 strategy demonstrates that social policy is a fundamental priority for Europe."
"However, more needs to be done to make improvements in this area and it is for this reason that I supported this report."
"The report calls for the elimination of forced labour as well as the abolition of child labour, and also highlights the need for more focus on the protection of workers' rights."
"Non-member countries must adhere to basic principles such as these if the EU is to work and trade with them."
"Member States must also cooperate with partner countries to ensure the protection of vulnerable groups and to fight gender discrimination as well as discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, religion, age and disability."
"I hope that the Commission will come forward with some concrete proposals which will bring about improved labour and social standards, as well as proposals to promote corporate social responsibility in its external polices."
"The rapporteur complains that people are still not the focus for social policy and that the human factor is still required to take a back seat to the competitiveness factor."
"As the report explains, the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model, which also gives rise to a certain responsibility."
"The EU should no longer be allowed to operate a double-standard, for which reason I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur."
"I am voting for this report because vocational education and training should be accessible, available and possible at all times of life, regardless of people's status on the labour market or of their income."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy."
"There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience."
"Especially where young people are concerned, action needs to be taken immediately: youth unemployment is one of Europe's most pressing challenges."
"Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty, taking into account specific national circumstances and needs."
"I agree with the provision laid down in the resolution that the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level, must be tackled by means of specific, creative and effective measures."
"Given that demographic changes are fuelling the need for training and adding to the necessity to participate in lifelong learning, workers must be provided with a means of determining and planning their own training needs."
"Furthermore, in order to enable people at different times of life and specific groups to have access to vocational education and training, financing opportunities should be broadened, simplified and made more readily available under the Lifelong Learning Programme and by implementing Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs."
"We must ensure that Europe's workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy."
"This despicable report maps the EU's strategic aim to come out on top in the competition for the monopolies with other imperialist centres, by promoting the integration of education into the quantifiable targets of the reactionary EU 2020 strategy which need to be 'transformed' into national targets."
"Within the framework of this global plan, particular attention is given to technical and vocational education, which is allocated the role of serving the needs of the cheapest possible, disenfranchised workforce worthy of the 'labour market' and 'competitiveness'."
"That is why education and training courses must meet both current and future market needs."
"Subjugation to the choices and plans of the capitalist undertaking must be strengthened, while 'employability' and entry to the labour market via apprenticeship, mobility in sectors of the economy and so-called accessibility between levels of education and training must be facilitated."
"Pronouncements about 'equal opportunities' and 'free choice' and satisfaction of the needs of young people conceal adaptation to the needs of the capitalist economy, which means a policy of class barriers in education adapted to the mediaeval labour practices of the 'memoranda' and of EU 2020."
"The economic crisis has turned the European Union labour market completely upside down."
"There is no large business area which has been left unscathed by the damaging consequences of this crisis, with the effects reaching the level of the citizen in the form of job insecurity, unemployment and poor conditions or opportunities for finding new employment."
"Vocational education and training are proving, in this context, to be a new opportunity, a new way of enabling European citizens' lives to return to normal."
"I am alarmed by the high youth unemployment rate."
"I believe that with the right education and ongoing training, many young people in Europe will manage to find themselves a well-paid job, appropriate to their vocational training or retraining."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for this dossier."
"I conclude, along with Nadja Hirsch, that if we want to fulfil these wishes, vocational education and training need to be clearly results-orientated."
"There must be one objective for 2020: every young person must have a job."
"The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21%, twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level."
"The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light, yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy, for instance through the Structural Funds and, in particular, through the European Social Fund."
"With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States."
"Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled 'An Agenda for new skills and jobs'."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Hirsch aimed at making comparisons between and within education systems."
"I am convinced that education should be more tailored to the needs of the labour market and should encourage creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship."
"Therefore, this report seeks to facilitate the mobility of teachers and students, and to simplify the recognition procedures for foreign professional qualifications, which is essential."
"The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy."
"There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience."
"The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society), sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness), and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty)."
"What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States."
"Action needs to be taken immediately, especially where the level of youth unemployment is concerned."
"It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover."
"I agree that in order to fully realise the EU 2020 flagship initiative 'An Agenda for new skills and jobs', the EU institutions should embark on a more pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging initiative supported by all Member States which should focus on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning, apprenticeships and the labour market."
"The EU is experiencing a severe economic, financial and social crisis."
"The consequences of this crisis have been primarily felt in the field of employment."
"There are currently 22.82 million unemployed people in the European Union."
"Young people under the age of 25 continue to be the worst hit, with unemployment at 21.3% in this age range."
"On the one hand, it is estimated that, by 2020, almost 15.6 million new jobs will be created for highly qualified people, but, on the other hand, 12 million jobs for people with few or no qualifications will be lost."
"The Europe 2020 strategy aims to respond to these new prospects for the professional world."
"This report stresses the need to develop European-level cooperation in the field of vocational education and training to increase transparency and for ease of comparison between the various education systems."
"This report also stresses the importance of promoting the transposition and implementation of European legislation to facilitate the mobility of teaching staff and students, as well as to simplify procedures for recognising foreign vocational qualifications."
"I therefore voted for this report."
"While youth unemployment is currently 21% in the European Union, and close to 25% in my country, this has become a major challenge for Europe at a time when young Europeans deprived of employment are threatened with social exclusion and poverty."
"The EU only has marginal responsibility on these issues."
"However, it seems that it can offer, if not solutions, at least interesting food for thought: it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow."
"The report calls on Member States to exchange good practices regarding their vocational education system and training systems combined with work experience, which should be extended in many Member States, particularly in France."
"These recommendations are going in the right direction to improve education and training in connection with the labour market and to reduce unemployment and social exclusion, but they will not be enough if Member States and the Commission do not make sufficient efforts at a time when youth unemployment is becoming the major political challenge in many Member States, particularly in my country, France."
"In today's globalised economy, the possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life for European citizens."
"In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels."
"As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level."
"To attain these goals, it is essential for education and vocational training to be treated as a long-term common political priority, which can only be realised with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders, the EU institutions and those involved at local and regional level."
"At this point, I would emphasise that action needs to be taken quickly, especially where young people are concerned: the rise in youth unemployment is, in fact, one of Europe's most pressing challenges."
"The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy - namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level - must be tackled with efficient and practical measures."
"In the age of a Europe without borders, education is a fundamental step in planning the professional lives of citizens, particularly at international level."
"Young people should be able to take advantage of the opportunities to acquire knowledge and experience provided by membership of their country in the European Union."
"The ever greater demand for mobile workers who have received a broad education is a further factor in favour of this lifestyle."
"In view of the above, unemployment among young people remains a worrying problem."
"The implementation of projects aimed at combating this hazardous phenomenon is an urgent issue."
"Every investment made in education helps to ensure a better future for young people."
"The use of European funds to launch concrete programmes in the field of vocational education and development is therefore particularly important."
"I thus agree with the need to develop instruments supporting 'lifelong learning' or, in other words, the regular improvement of qualifications."
"Creative and effective educational programmes should make it possible to accomplish one of the overriding objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to ensure that at least 40% of people complete higher education."
"I do not intend to support Mrs Hirsch's own-initiative report, not so much because of its statements of principle, which are commendable in terms of emphasising the importance of bringing the labour market and the world of formal training closer together, but because, once again, we are lacking a practical, proactive approach to the issue that transcends sterile considerations and offers concrete solutions to resolve a social emergency that cannot be resolved through rhetoric."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in lifelong learning have already become a necessity."
"Consequently, the report draws attention to the need to modernise both initial and continuing vocational education and training, proposes concluding basic education with a career aptitude assessment and stresses the importance of initial training for teachers."
"It also emphasises the importance, at local and regional level, of fostering effective cooperation between schools, training agencies, research centres and firms, in order to overcome the inward-looking nature of education systems and the mismatch between knowledge and skills and the needs of the labour market."
"I agree that in order to modernise training and education, we must strengthen the link between potential employers and schools, and therefore the inclusion of social partners in curriculum development would be another step towards greater employment in Europe."
"The Europe 2020 strategy states that the key factors for smart growth are not only fostering knowledge, innovation, and education, and promoting the digital society, but also sustainable and inclusive growth."
"The key to achieving these, in this case, is vocational education and training, for which all Member States must adopt the same standards."
"In spite of the severe impact which the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next 10 years."
"The projections suggest that the demand for skills will continue to rise."
"Industrial and technological change increases the demand for workers with high and intermediate skill levels, with low-skilled labour being squeezed out."
"There is ever-increasing emphasis on a clear, results-orientated learning approach."
"Reforms have already been implemented in vocational education systems in some Member States."
"As regards the comparability of vocational education and training systems in Member States, the priorities must be to break down barriers, increase transparency and facilitate comparison within and between the different systems."
"I voted in favour of this report because, as it clearly points out, young people are the real resource of the future."
"Hence, we have a duty to ensure that they all have access to vocational education and training."
"The economic crisis that has struck Europe and elsewhere over the last few years has affected young people the most."
"Unemployment among that age group has sharply increased, and those who do find a job have to settle for fixed-term contracts and for being underpaid."
"We need to work effectively and quickly in order to give some dignity back to these young people, who want to work and, above all, become part of a world in which they are unlikely to be accepted with open arms."
"These objectives can also be found in the Europe 2020 strategy where it establishes the obligation to focus on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Generally speaking, Mrs Hirsch's report is a good starting point for what must become one of the priority policies of Parliament and the entire European Union."
"in writing. - I voted against the measure for Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy as I am fearful of any organisation that divides opinion having access and influence over minds."
"There is a large enough percentage of the EU population who consider themselves Eurosceptic for it to be deemed inappropriate that Brussels be at the helm of education and training."
"Such activity could be deemed propaganda."
"Vocational education and training measures are absolutely essential for turning the European economy into a knowledge economy, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"This is why I fully support the recommendations made by this report, which highlight the importance of investment in vocational education and training for the European economy's future competitiveness."
"We need effective measures, complementing each other at national and European level, in order to achieve our objectives."
"There has been an alarming rise in the youth unemployment rate in the EU."
"This report sends out a clear message: vocational education and training are key factors in tackling youth unemployment."
"Clear strategies are needed to facilitate their inclusion in the labour market, which will encourage the correlation between education programmes and the demands of the labour market, so that it can take up the graduates."
"The required approach must put the emphasis on specific skills so as to facilitate integration into the labour market."
"Furthermore, due to the constant technological changes, employers have ever-increasing expectations with regard to employees' qualifications."
"This is why ongoing training plays a key role in constantly adapting vocational qualifications to the demands of the economy."
"This can help people avoid being excluded from the labour market at some time during their career."
"The report as a whole is driven by the philosophy of linking vocational education and training to the needs of the market and of businesses within the EU 2020 strategy, a strategy which further erodes the social fabric and workers' rights."
"Although there are some positive references to general principles of 'humanising work' and promoting creativity and the need for accessible pathways from informal to formal learning, they are all stale dead letter which simply embellish a report which, in the final analysis, promotes neoliberalism in every procedure and at every stage of education and training, even at the highest level."
"For example, it calls on the Member States to support doctoral and post-doctoral programmes that will underpin competitiveness and to facilitate 'labour mobility', commonly known as job insecurity."
"Finally, one of the most important disadvantages of the report is that it calls for the Member States to ensure 'mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States', thereby putting pressure on them to recognise diplomas from various Greek or foreign colleges as 'equivalent' to a degree from a State university."
"That is why I voted against the report."
"There is currently a tragic situation in a number of Member States as regards unemployment rates, especially amongst young people, for whom the current rate of unemployment is double the general EU rate of unemployment."
"This is, therefore, one of Europe's most pressing problems."
"It is essential that the Member States adopt political strategies aimed at combating this problem that are based on the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% per year, and of enabling at least 40% of young people to complete higher education."
"These must be tackled with concrete, creative and effective measures."
"Unfortunately, I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy's ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget restrictions, which have substantially cut funding for the main EU programmes in the area of education."
"I welcome the measures adopted by the Commission aimed at facilitating accessibility, transparency and comparability for the purposes of the recognition process within and among education systems."
"It is also important that the Member States start reforming their systems, and gear vocational education and training towards the true needs of the labour market."
"In an effort to encourage European cooperation to support the Europe 2020 strategy, I would like to give my full backing to three points highlighted in this report."
"Firstly, I strongly support the need to improve dialogue between the labour market and the educational system by increasing the number of traineeships available in businesses, in order to enable students to become actively involved in the business world and also to strengthen links between businesses and educational institutions with regard to vocational training."
"I also think it is a good idea to integrate educational systems more at international level, firstly, to ensure that people's qualifications are fully recognised, and secondly, to promote cross-border mobility projects."
"Finally, I fully agree with Parliament's suggestion to the Commission to make the necessary adjustments to the European Social Fund, Erasmus and the Lifelong Learning Programme in order to ensure that funding can be allocated to specific education and training projects, and to projects to tackle youth unemployment and gender discrimination, with more women being encouraged to take part in those projects."
"in writing. - I support this report, which calls on the Member States to ensure that people, at different times of life, have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally."
"Vocational education and training should be accessible, available and affordable at all times of life, regardless of the people's status on the labour market or of their income."
"In particular, in order to achieve a better social integration and greater social cohesion, this report urges Member States to create training opportunities specific to groups such as unemployed youth, ethnic minorities, vulnerable women and people with disabilities."
"The report also points out that financing opportunities should be widened, simplified, and made more readily available, using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund, the Lifelong Learning Programme as a whole, and Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs."
"The fight against youth unemployment is one of the most urgent challenges for Europe."
"That is why the Member States must urgently adopt targeted strategies that take national specificities and needs into account."
"Learning methods should be more flexible and accessible on a lifelong basis."
"We need to expand the possibilities of acquiring experience abroad for all."
"Apprenticeships should also be better recognised."
"Education and vocational training should be treated as a long-term common political priority to enable European workers to adapt to the requirements of a changing economy."
"At a time when youth unemployment in Europe is twice that of the working population, the proposals in the Hirsch report are a useful contribution to the policy pursued by the governments of the 27 Member States to combat unemployment."
"Faced with the challenges that are an ageing population and the globalisation of our economy, we need to encourage the development of lifelong training programmes, particularly through the exchange of good practices between Member States, and improve young Europeans' early training by encouraging partnerships between universities, research centres and companies."
"According to future estimates relating to employability and required diplomas, there are allegedly 15.6 million new jobs within the EU for graduates and 3.7 million for those with a secondary education qualification (source: Cedefop)."
"On the other hand, 12 million jobs are going to be cut for those with a lower level of qualification!"
"Faced with this inevitable catastrophe, the 2020 strategy had to aim at increasing the attractiveness of vocational education and training."
"The report calls for adopting an approach focused on results in terms of apprenticeships, improving the recognition of formal and informal apprenticeships, and setting up assistance centres and schemes for those apprentices who struggle the most."
"In the context of a post-crisis Europe that is recovering and growing, vocational education and training are of crucial importance."
"It is essential to give young Europeans the tools necessary for them to be able to compete in a globalised world and for them to be able to enter the labour market using their knowledge and skills."
"We cannot forget that youth unemployment figures are overwhelming throughout Europe."
"However, we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market."
"Cases of young graduates, with additional training and postgraduate training, but without a job and without prospects of finding one, are multiplying in the EU."
"Training must be geared towards the needs of the market and prepare young workers."
"In my opinion, this paradigm shift will be vital in stopping the growth of unemployment amongst younger people and in guaranteeing them a future with more possibilities."
"This report by Mrs Hirsch tackles the problem of European cooperation on vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The goals of the Europe 2020 strategy - smart, sustainable and inclusive growth - must be given immediate consideration."
"Although the current economic and financial situation does not seem favourable, we must be able to turn less favourable situations into opportunities."
"In an increasingly globalised world, we cannot confine ourselves to a given territory, but must cultivate mobility, flexibility and international experience."
"It is important that early training be of a high quality and that young people be able to choose to work in other countries."
"I voted for the report because I agree with its proposals."
"Of these, I should like to stress the need for new and diversified lifelong learning, which is crucial for better-quality work, particularly in the context of jobs, as well as the need to pay particular attention to young people, to women and to the disabled, as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This is yet another tedious repetition of the European Commission's standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level, which are considered the best guarantee of improving workers' 'employability' and 'adaptability'."
"Vocational training is viewed here as a means of promoting 'entrepreneurship' and of responding to the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'."
"It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it'."
"The report's ideological framework suddenly becomes clear: the problem of employment is a problem for the individual and not an eminently social one, with the individual - and not society - having to solve it, whether by increasing their 'employability' or by becoming an 'entrepreneur'; a tax system that is profit-friendly and, therefore, imposed mainly on workers and consumers; and education and training totally at the beck and call of capital."
"As for the rest, it does not examine the causes in depth, or seek solutions."
"This report repeats the European Commission's standard rhetoric on issues of lifelong learning and promotion of mobility at EU level, which are considered to be the best guarantee against unemployment, and the need for workers to improve their 'employability' and 'adaptability', so as to organise the supply of education and training."
"However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'."
"It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it'."
"In other words, what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism."
"Moreover, it fails to mention the social reasons that lead to early school drop-out, to a lack of access to higher education opportunities and to youth unemployment, just so as to mask the responsibility of the neoliberal policies promoted by large companies and financial institutions."
"We therefore consider this report unacceptable."
"It does not examine the causes in depth, or seek solutions."
"I firmly believe that professional education and training should be available and affordable on a lifelong basis, regardless of a person's position on the labour market or their income."
"Access to professional education should respond to the particular needs of individuals, and thus make it easier for them to find a job."
"It is necessary to create opportunities for specific groups in EU Member States, such as unemployed young people, ethnic minorities, vulnerable women, people with disabilities and others, in order to achieve better social integration and better social cohesion."
"Last but not least, extended, simplified and more accessible funding options would undoubtedly assist the successful implementation of the above aims."
"With this report, we are adding another element to the European strategy on youth policy."
"It is right to support the internationalisation of studies together with job flexibility among young workers in an increasingly competitive labour market."
"Europe's young people must be given the opportunity to compete with their contemporaries from the four corners of the globe."
"Youth unemployment figures cannot leave us indifferent."
"We should welcome this report, which emphasises the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives: to combat youth unemployment through efficient and effective measures such as, for example, reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensuring that at least 40% of young people are educated to university level."
"However, this should not be a finishing line but a starting point: future priorities should be to establish links between universities and businesses and to bring back compulsory traineeships / apprenticeships funded by public or private bodies."
"We do not have much time to play with and we must act now."
"Otherwise, the legacy we leave to future generations will be a very heavy one."
"I welcome the adoption of this report which puts the challenges of vocational education and training back at the heart of the concerns of the European Union and its Member States."
"At a time of budget austerity, which is a direct consequence of the global crisis that has hit the European labour market hard, we need to consider our strategies for growth and employment, especially for young people, without losing sight of national differences and needs."
"Young people are the first victims of unemployment and are very prone to dropping out of school."
"This is why it is imperative to modernise curricula and training so that they are more closely tailored to the needs of our companies."
"These efforts should also be applied to the area of lifelong training and in promoting mobility."
"Achieving these objectives will only be possible if all stakeholders (European institutions, Member States, local and regional players) join forces."
"I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately, especially where young people are concerned: rising youth unemployment is one of Europe's most pressing challenges."
"It is not just that the unemployment rate is higher among young workers than among their adult counterparts: young people are also to be found more frequently in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and less social security cover."
"Member States must adopt targeted political strategies to combat poverty, taking into account specific national circumstances and needs."
"The aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, namely, to reduce the school drop-out rate to below 10% and ensure that 40% of young people are educated to university level, must be tackled by means of specific, creative and effective measures."
"Vocational education and training have to be treated as a long-term common political priority, which can be translated into reality only with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders: as well as the EU institutions and the Member States, those involved at local and regional level must use their influence to make this happen."
"We must ensure that Europe's workers are able to adapt to the requirements of the economy."
"Policy makers must enable people to improve and broaden their skills."
"Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy."
"in writing. - I would like to welcome this report which draws attention to the necessity of broadening the system of vocational training in the EU since equal access to quality lifelong learning means better chances in the labour market and thereby contributes to fulfilment of the goals of the EU's 2020 strategy."
"Special emphasis must be put on preventing youth unemployment, for which it is necessary to harmonise training supply with labour-market demand, provide middle-term national and regional forecasts on expected labour demand and enable national education systems to be more effective in guaranteeing the attainment of those skills that are actively sought on the labour market."
"According to Cedefop, we can expect a 12 million decline in jobs available for low skilled or unskilled labour, which presages an increasing risk of poverty for the most vulnerable."
"In many cases, even those who finish school are unable to enter the labour market and therefore are more likely to engage themselves in casual work or work in the black economy."
"Consequently, they are unable to start a life on their own and often become an unbearable burden on households, creating a vicious circle of unsatisfactory education and joblessness."
"The motion for a resolution draws particular attention to the education of young people and highlights the need for practical training."
"Ensuring access to suitable education and appropriate courses is absolutely essential in order to make sure that people finishing school, university or vocational training have no trouble in finding employment in their chosen field."
"Let us emphasise that these should be jobs with good conditions and decent pay."
"According to forecasts, economic problems will not change the fact that employment levels are rising in the EU, and should not give rise to a reduction in funding for the EU's key programmes in the field of vocational education and training, such as the 'Lifelong Learning' programme, for example."
"These funds should, in fact, be increased, so that everyone, regardless of their age, gender or location, has access to the same opportunities in terms of vocational education and careers."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Hirsch report on European cooperation in vocational education and training, I would like to explain why I voted in favour of adopting this report."
"In the current situation, when ageing societies, on the one hand, and an alarmingly high rate of unemployment among young people, on the other, mean that Europe is faced with very serious challenges, vocational education and training have a fundamental role to play."
"When endeavouring to secure future support for vocational education and training, we should therefore, at the same time, attach the greatest importance to monitoring the effectiveness of training and to an approach focused on achieving the goal of increasing employment levels and social integration."
"It is my belief that vocational education and training must be closely linked with the labour market, a characteristic feature of which is constant adaptation to economic, demographic and social changes."
"In my opinion, ensuring that the ESF is managed more flexibly and that this fund complements other European employment instruments and domestic measures is an extremely important issue."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a successful and comprehensive report, and to thank her for her excellent cooperation."
"The objectives of the EU 2020 strategy include, in particular, reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% and ensuring that at least 40% of young generations obtain a qualification."
"These objectives pursue the European ambition, laid out for the first time in the Lisbon strategy, to make the Union the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"That is why the Copenhagen process which, since 2002, has been laying the foundations of greater cooperation in terms of the Member States' policies with regard to vocational education and training, is particularly important."
"I voted for this resolution because it sets ambitious objectives to improve the European programmes for education and training."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Mrs Hirsch's report."
"In order to face the economic challenges of the 21st century and, in particular, the growing competition of our trading partners, European systems for vocational education and training have an obligation to be more effective, more attractive and more reactive, in order to better prepare our fellow citizens to the jobs that need filling."
"We must therefore work towards tailoring these systems to the needs of the world of work."
"I think there is also a need to facilitate access to high quality work experience in Europe and, therefore, to preserve and strengthen the existing programmes aimed at increasing apprentices' mobility."
"Setting up a real 'Erasmus for apprentices', that is the commitment I undertook during the 2009 European election campaign: this is about the young and the not so young, while putting a foot in the world of work and gaining work experience, having the opportunity to travel within Europe and having direct contact with the economic realities of our Internal Market."
"Finally, we should also simplify and improve the system for recognising vocational qualifications in Europe, in order to revive the Internal Market and provide our fellow citizens with the keys to enhanced professional mobility."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society), sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness), and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty)."
"What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy."
"Education is undoubtedly a complex, long-term process, the quality and, in particular, the results of which consequently influence the future careers of young people."
"This should not be forgotten."
"In this context, I would like to say that demand for professional competence in a whole range of areas and activities will grow with the development of modern new technologies and the establishment of higher quality and safety standards, thus creating a requirement for the more goal-oriented training of young people."
"I am talking, however, about high-quality education built on the concept of modern teaching elements, about education made attractive in a specific way and showing the need for a given field of education, with a view to other options for boosting qualifications."
"The education process should result in professionally trained young people who have a clear idea of growth prospects and, first and foremost, who exploit their acquired knowledge, expertise and ability in the activity for which they have been trained and have acquired a qualification, the area of activity they have mastered and in respect of which they have shown an inclination."
"The report on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy satisfactorily identifies the objectives that we set ourselves a while ago with that very same strategy."
"Ongoing dialogue between the world of vocational training and education and the labour market is more necessary than ever today."
"The main challenge is precisely to ensure that the labour market meets the needs of new workers on an increasingly regular basis."
"The proper implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy is essential in order for Europe to get back to sustained and sustainable economic growth."
"Young people are a crucial element of the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, as is well-known, they are currently the ones suffering most from the crisis, not least with unemployment reaching extremely high levels: unemployment rates amongst young people are double those for all the other unemployed."
"In order to achieve this, there is a need for significant investment in the area of vocational education and training."
"In a globalised world, quality education and vocational training are the vital keys that every young person should have when entering the labour market."
"The world economy requires skills, flexibility, availability and knowledge of languages."
"Faced with these requirements, it is our duty as politicians to put in place strategies that ensure the following: • Learning centred on a specific outcome; • Teaching entrepreneurship; • Providing bridges for unqualified people who wish to find a job, in particular, through tailored education; • Simplifying the procedures for recognising foreign qualifications in order to encourage workers to be mobile; • Establishing a European framework that offers quality work placements throughout the EU; • Lifelong learning so as to enable workers to adapt to market conditions and company needs. • Promoting creativity as well as information and communication technologies. • Supporting female employment by helping to reconcile work and family life."
"in writing. - Vocational education and training should be accessible, available and affordable at all times of life, regardless of people's status on the labour market or of their income."
"It is necessary to create training opportunities for specific groups, such as unemployed youth, ethnic minorities, vulnerable women, people with disabilities, etc., in order to achieve better social integration and greater social cohesion."
"Financing opportunities should be widened, simplified and made more readily available using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund and the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"In my opinion, this initiative is very important and timely."
"I voted in favour."
"The world of work has undergone some major changes."
"While, in the past, a good education was a guarantee of a good job, these days, a higher education diploma or degree will not protect young people in particular from unemployment."
"In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a start in one's career."
"On the other hand, businesses are constantly complaining about the shortage of specialist staff, using this supposed shortage as an excuse to use cheap labour."
"The complete flexibility and mobility demanded, as well as the 'bucket' prices being imposed on the labour market in the form of new working models like 'Mac-jobs', make it impossible for many people to establish a family and to achieve a reasonable work-life balance."
"Within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, it may make sense to support the mutual recognition of education and training."
"However, the success of the strategy depends on taking steps to deal with these problematic developments."
"In this sense, the report's call for rapid action in relation to youth unemployment is to be welcomed, although there is a lack of concrete detail."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"There are major challenges ahead in Europe's labour market."
"The younger generation is faced with the problem that good education alone is no guarantee of finding a good job."
"Worse still, it no longer even offers protection against unemployment."
"On the other hand, large businesses are complaining of a shortage of specialist staff, often a welcome excuse for employing people at low wage rates."
"This renders it impossible to establish a family or to find a reasonable work-life balance."
"The mutual recognition of education and training is the first step in the right direction."
"The report's call for action in the area of youth unemployment is also correct."
"However, simply calling for action is too vague."
"For that reason, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because cooperation at European Union level in the field of vocational training is a very important factor for achieving the Europe 2020 goals and reducing the level of youth unemployment."
"I agree with the proposal that, in forming a vocational education and training system, every Member State should devote particular attention to low-skilled workers, migrants, people with disabilities and other socially vulnerable groups."
"Training programmes should be oriented to their needs and level of ability."
"Furthermore, we must promote closer cooperation among the Member States' various education systems in order to guarantee the integration of young people and encourage lifelong learning and formal/informal training."
"To ensure that vocational training matches labour market needs, I feel that it is advisable to incorporate information about changes in the labour market into national education strategies and programmes."
"The Commission should play major role here, by providing information about the skills and needs of individual regions and changes in the EU labour market."
"Furthermore, it is very important to create a favourable business environment for companies that cooperate in developing and implementing vocational training programmes."
"I voted in favour of the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training because this issue occupies an important place in the Europe 2020 strategy with the aim of ensuring economic development."
"Cooperating in order to improve vocational education and training means reducing the youth unemployment rate, equipping workers with cognitive tools and providing greater and simplified funding opportunities."
"The current socio-economic context requires the ability to work in international set-ups; we therefore need to increase the opportunities for learning, given also the role of businesses, which increasingly need skilled staff with practical training experience whom they can put to work immediately and effectively."
"This own-initiative report, in which the competent drafting committee incorporated numerous proposals by the Committee on Culture and Education, aims to galvanise the EU and the Member States into achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, especially in the employment and training sector."
"Account is taken of specific challenges such as: the demand for ever-increasing qualifications by the labour market, which puts low-skilled jobs at risk, the spiralling increase in youth unemployment, which is over 30% in certain EU Member States, including Greece, and the failure on the part of the Member States to take adequate measures to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy (for example, to reduce the percentage of early school leavers to 10% and to increase the percentage of young people with a university education to 40%)."
"Alongside social protection for citizens with fewer skills or a low level of education, we urgently need investment in new skills, especially those required for jobs in strategic sectors as far as growth is concerned."
"This is a key point for Greece."
"European cooperation on vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy is essential."
"The possibility of learning and working in an international context is an important prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy."
"There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she says that there is a need to breathe life into the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This process should start immediately with practical measures being adopted at EU level and in the Member States in the field of vocational education and training."
"All of these factors are reasons why I am voting in favour of this report."
"Indeed, we are obliged to put Europe's workers in a position to adapt to the requirements of the economy."
"As political decision makers, we must enable people to develop and broaden their skills."
"Personal skill development, in addition to helping people find better jobs, must also provide them with the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy."
"In an increasingly globalised world, it is important for young people to be able to expand their education and training through mobility."
"The labour market increasingly requires mobile, flexible people with international experience."
"Despite the economic crisis, it is estimated that the European labour market will see steady growth over the next 10 years."
"That is why the EU has implemented the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to focus greater attention on vocational education and training."
"More and more effort must be made to break down barriers, increase transparency and make for ease of comparison within and between education systems."
"The education sector should pay closer attention to labour market needs, call for a method of assessing the results of learning and improve the quality of its own standards so as to become more professional."
"Lastly, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged, so that Europe's young people and workers can broaden their knowledge and thus adapt to the needs of the economy."
"In order to achieve these objectives and to ensure that vocational education and training continue to be a key political priority for everyone in the long term, I voted in favour of the proposal in question."
"The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty). What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in Member States for putting the strategy into practice."
"Europe's workers must be able to adapt to the economy's requirements."
"Political decision makers must enable people to upgrade and broaden their skills."
"I call on Member States to monitor actions to facilitate the transition from school to working life by developing integrated careers guidance and advice programmes, to create better training opportunities for trainers and lay the foundations for a facilitative learning partnership, particularly at regional and local level."
"As far as vocational education and training are concerned, Member States need to take into consideration the individual needs of low-skilled workers, migrant learners, people belonging to ethnic minorities, women, the unemployed and people with disabilities."
"I call on Member States to support innovative activities, as well as doctoral and post-doctoral programmes, which will underpin competitiveness and sustainable economic growth."
"in writing. - One of the most pressing challenges in the current economic climate is that of youth unemployment."
"Not only is the unemployment rate higher among young workers than among the rest of the population, but young workers are often to be found in insecure temporary jobs with lower pay and weaker legal protection."
"It is vitally important we address this."
"The forecast by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) of growth of 80 million new jobs by 2020 is welcome."
"It is worth noting that there will be a shift towards industrial and technological development and a corresponding shift away from low-skilled labour."
"These new jobs will require workers with high and intermediate level skills."
"Action needs to be taken quickly to ensure that adequately skilled workers are available to fill these positions."
"With that in mind we must ensure that our approach to learning is focused on results."
"We must provide young people with access to lifelong learning and to courses with practical training elements to enable them to take up these jobs and to grow and progress in their careers."
"I believe these changes to vocational education will benefit the economies of all Member States."
"On the one hand, Europe is experiencing increased unemployment among young people and the insecure and temporary nature of the jobs young people normally do."
"On the other, however, it is also clear that companies lack qualified professionals whose training is geared towards the duties they should be performing."
"It is therefore important to seek to bring job supply in line with demand using measures such as, for example, independent advice on vocational training, making funds available for supporting vocational training, and competition between establishments providing said training."
"Ultimately, the aim is for people to be able to find a better job, but also, as the explanatory statement says, for them to have 'the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future'."
"Today, we voted during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next 10 years."
"As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States."
"If the goals indicated in the Europe 2020 strategy are to be attained, vocational education and training have to be treated as a key priority of the European Union institutions and those involved at local and regional level."
"Mrs Hirsch's report embraces the Commission measures aimed at breaking down barriers, increasing transparency, and making for ease of comparison for the purposes of recognition within and between education systems, emphasising that it is important to ensure that education is geared more closely to the needs of the labour market, helping to boost creativity and innovation."
"The EU and the Member States should increase their efforts to encourage youth employment and reduce their unemployment rate, in particular, through improving the match between the training systems and the needs of the labour market."
"With the loss of 12 million low-skilled jobs in Europe by 2020, and the need for longer working lives to preserve our social model in the face of the demographic challenge, it is also crucial, at the same time, to step up the efforts for improving lifelong training of workers in the course of their career."
"In this respect, the idea of putting in place incentive mechanisms intended for employers so that they encourage their employees to participate in training programmes, suggested by Mrs Hirsch in this report, sounds interesting."
"In addition, in order to combat unemployment among low-skilled people, as well as to promote the employment of senior citizens, it is imperative to encourage the recognition of national qualifications between the Member States, and to encourage certification by validating skills acquired through informal apprenticeship."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in a globalised economy."
"There is a growing need for mobile, flexible employees with international experience."
"The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth (fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society), sustainable growth (more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness), and inclusive growth (increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty). What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy."
"In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market, it can be assumed that employment growth in Europe will recover, at least gradually, over the next ten years."
"According to Cedefop's current Europe-wide skill supply and demand forecast, the number of new jobs up to 2020 is estimated at 80 million."
"The possibility and ability to learn and work in an international context is a prerequisite for a successful working life in an ever more globalised economy."
"Industry is increasingly calling for education and training offerings to be related directly to practical requirements and oriented towards solutions."
"What matters is that those who have completed a vocational education or training course should bring their newly acquired abilities and skills to the working environment."
"The resolution adopted today is a first step towards ensuring that Europe's workers are put in a position to adapt to the requirements of the economy."
"People must be given the means to upgrade and broaden their skills."
"Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy."
"Education, vocational training and also the universal idea of 'lifelong learning' are the building blocks for the future of European integration, which is coming up against ever-new challenges in respect of support for the Europe 2020 strategy."
"We must face up to the fact that the level of unemployment among young people is increasing at an alarming rate."
"Problems associated with vocational education and training are becoming a priority for us."
"People at the start of their professional careers may find that unemployment has a negative effect on their further activity in the labour market."
"Vocational education and training make it possible to move around freely within the labour market, according to the changing economic situation and the demands of a particular economic sector."
"It is worth highlighting the usefulness and merits of existing cross-border educational programmes, for example, the Leonardo Da Vinci programme, which deserve our support."
"They make it possible for individuals to acquire the qualities which are characteristic of a mobile workforce."
"Mobility eliminates the difficulties which arise as a result of the natural diversity of the individual labour markets, and provides young workers with access to the enormous European labour market, full of new challenges and opportunities to make use of the experience they have gained."
"The Member States are faced with the task of facilitating supervision and assistance in respect of the establishment of cooperation and the exchange of information between schools, training institutions, research centres and businesses."
"Young workers bring new reserves of knowledge, skills and experience to the EU labour market."
"in writing. - I support this report."
"However, I believe the scale of the cuts to the lifelong learning programme and the People programme is unacceptably severe."
"The fight against youth unemployment must be a priority for all European governments."
"We need to provide European young people with a full, attractive and competitive offer in terms of training and education, one that enables them to find a job more easily."
"In particular, I believe that vocational education and lifelong learning should thus be more in tune with the needs of the labour market."
"Furthermore, higher education should be combined with vocational training by giving priority, for instance, to a mix of training and work."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of the Hirsch report."
"Youth unemployment in Europe is at 21% and currently affects more than 5.5 million young Europeans, who are at risk of social exclusion because of a lack of opportunities and are forced to accept insecure jobs."
"Training and education are the major challenges the European Union is currently facing, enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The goals have been set of reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10% and enabling 40% of young people to complete higher education by 2020."
"These are fairly ambitious targets, but they are necessary for economic growth and for making the Member States more competitive, thereby creating jobs."
"I voted for this report, since I think it is essential to have a long-term, EU-level strategy that also enables structural unemployment and youth unemployment to be tackled."
"To this end, I think it is important to continue supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, since they create 50% of jobs, and to invest in continuous, lifelong learning."
"Finally, I should like to mention the need to recognise vocational qualifications, thereby facilitating the increased mobility of professionals and students."
"Combating youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing the EU."
"In order to address this problem, we need to invest more in the education and training of young people so that they are equipped for future challenges on the labour market, which is becoming more and more demanding."
"The report also quite rightly states that the European Social Fund could contribute more towards the education of the financially weak."
"Especially important, as I personally have stated on several occasions, is the proposal to facilitate labour mobility within the framework of the Internal Market."
"European cooperation to draft a single policy is needed in this sector."
"For all these reasons, I supported this particular report."
"The mismatch between young people's qualifications and the needs of the labour market is one of the reasons why Lithuania has such a terribly high rate of youth unemployment (34%)."
"In 2010, 52% of all unemployed young people (50 000) who registered with the Lithuanian Labour Exchange did not have any vocational training."
"The inability of my country's young people to find suitable work has caused a huge wave of youth emigration - in the last few years, 50% of Lithuanian emigrants were aged 20-34."
"The need for a mobile and flexible workforce is growing and therefore, we must help Europe's workforce to adapt to the needs of the economy, giving them the opportunity to improve their skills and enhance their knowledge."
"It is important for vocational training to be accessible to all people."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur understands this."
"ESF funding could be invaluable, helping to provide training for neglected groups in Lithuanian society."
"The time has also come for the EU to use effective and creative measures to implement the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, such as reducing the school drop-out rate to under 10% and ensuring that 40% of young people are educated to university level."
"in writing. - Both young and old people alike should have access to vocational education and training."
"For example, both the Lifelong Learning and People schemes provide invaluable opportunities to those who want to learn new skills and find new jobs."
"Current unemployment levels, particularly among young people, are worrying and more needs to be done to ensure that young people are able to gain vital skills and qualifications."
"I strongly believe that the ESF has a valuable role to play in training and educating people."
"It is important that those on lower incomes receive financial support to help them attend training courses, which would, in turn, give them more opportunity to fully integrate themselves in the labour market."
"The Europe 2020 strategy should provide for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"A results-based approach is also essential in relation to learning."
"'Lifelong learning' is an absolute priority for our citizens, which is why access to vocational education and training must be a priority for us."
"I am voting for this report."
"It assesses the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI), but I note the importance of the mechanism that should succeed it this year."
"I agree with the rapporteur's criticisms of the fact that the scrutiny work carried out by Parliament was not acknowledged by the representatives of the Member States or the DCI Committee."
"I voted in favour of this Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future."
"2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI)."
"Further simplification and adaptation to new challenges, such as climate change, as well as determining the external dimension of the EU's internal policies, are important aspects that must be taken into consideration."
"I agree with the provision set out in the resolution that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms."
"The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015."
"The current level of European aid will have to increase significantly to achieve this aim."
"Coordination and division of labour must be the guiding principles of programming under the new development instrument."
"The idea of European strategy documents should be pursued as a matter of high priority, and the European Parliament must be actively involved in this process."
"Parliament must have the opportunity to defend the specificity of the EU's development policy in the post-2013 development cooperation instrument by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council."
"The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) is one of the European Union's extremely altruistic projects, intended to provide assistance to developing countries without any conditions or ulterior interests."
"The lack of any utilitarian aspect to the EU's involvement must force its institutions to target these funds much better and focus on eradicating poverty and complying with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)."
"I must stress the need for greater transparency for all funds earmarked for this purpose and, more importantly, for increasing the assessments of the impact which the DCI has among the population in those countries."
"This is because these funds must be backed up by effective social policies implemented in developing countries."
"These funds must be, in the medium and long term, the 'rod' which the relevant peoples will use to learn to 'fish' and successfully become self-sufficient."
"We must not forget that 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"This is precisely why the Development Cooperation Instrument must continue this fight in developing countries as well, by making a significant contribution to guaranteeing a decent living for as many citizens as possible."
"in writing. - The purpose of this report on the establishment of a financial instrument for development cooperation is to set at an early stage a Parliament position on this topic."
"This position should be based on the lessons drawn from its scrutiny of the implementation of our development cooperation."
"I appreciated the method followed by the rapporteur in evaluating the outcome and modalities of the EU cooperation for development."
"The rapporteur clearly states that, in spite of the constructiveness of the dialogue with the Commission, the Commission itself did not change its behaviour in development matters as Parliament recommended."
"Parliament's position was only sporadically reflected in the draft implementing measures submitted by the Commission to the DCI management committee."
"This is partially understandable."
"The main partner of the rapporteur was DG RELEX, whose main mandate is the promotion of EU interests in the rest of the world."
"But development cooperation is the one policy area of external action (besides humanitarian aid) which is not designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most vulnerable populations of this planet."
"Since the position expressed in this report fully reflects this global inspiration, I was glad to vote in favour of it."
"I supported Mr Mitchell's report because I believe we have to increase the participation of parliaments in developing countries when drawing up strategy papers for these countries, for the poverty eradication strategy for instance."
"Moreover, European development aid must be adequately funded."
"The European Union has pledged to devote 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015, which will mean increasing the current amount of European aid."
"The Millennium Development Goals deadline falls within the duration of the first financing instrument for development cooperation."
"Therefore, the ongoing cooperation with local authorities must be expanded and their role in combating poverty and hunger, improving water and health services, and encouraging local economic development must be developed."
"Security of food supply, the challenges of the agricultural sector and feed production, and the cost of living crisis must be addressed when the financing instruments and broad policy for cooperation and collaboration for development are being created."
"I welcome what is said on that subject in the report."
"I agree that the Commission should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the general budgetary support, containing details of the support being given to particular sectors, to particular projects, and to local governments."
"That information would help in the future when efforts are being made to allocate resources and funding more efficiently, and consequently would allow any problems in the distribution system to be identified."
"A more consistent policy would result from this."
"The overarching objective of development cooperation is the eradication of poverty in partner countries, including pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"To achieve these objectives, the EU needs a specific financing instrument for development cooperation."
"The Commission has committed itself to presenting a legislative proposal for the financing instruments for external action later this year, and to reconsidering the overall structure of the external financing instruments when debating the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."
"I voted in favour of this document, which establishes Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation."
"I agree that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms, given the commitments made by the EU in this field to spend 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance by 2015."
"I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation with developing countries, areas and regions because of the wish expressed by the motion in respect of the management of illegal immigration."
"In particular, it maintains that development funds for migration should not be used for strengthening border management and combating illegal immigration."
"This position is incompatible with our political approach in which strengthening borders and combating illegal immigration are key priorities, and therefore we would argue that additional resources should be invested in this direction."
"I therefore decided to vote against the motion."
"The issue of development cooperation is one of the cardinal principles underpinning my work."
"I believe that the excellent report by Mr Mitchell successfully highlights the areas in which Europe could and should do better."
"The experience of the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been fundamental in understanding how the European Union should proceed in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"If we want to make financing instruments effective, then we need to set up financing that is independent of other measures, recalculate quotas, and review how instruments are implemented."
"This review must be based on a Neighbourhood Policy that is sensitive to the range of needs of poorer countries and no longer just to the interests of Europe."
"I firmly believe that EU development policy must be the result of work by both Parliament and the Council, and that Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should also apply to this issue."
"These principles have been clearly stated in the report in question, and I therefore voted in favour."
"I welcome the adoption of Mr Mitchell's report which is aimed at establishing Parliament's position in relation to the new financing instrument designed to regulate the European Union's development cooperation, based on the lessons learned from implementing the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) (the financing instrument for development cooperation)."
"In this respect, I should like to point out that high levels of poverty remain in the developing countries, territories and regions and that we need to increase the funds devoted to the causes of poverty, in particular, malnutrition, health problems, education, access to drinking water, instead of moving towards systems for regulating immigration which come under other financial schemes."
"Development aid must enable the populations concerned to remain in their geographical area."
"Regulating immigration must be done through another financial instrument and must lead to increased resources for FRONTEX."
"That was the logic behind my voting for this report."
"To begin with, I should like to welcome the efforts that have been made by the European Union to eradicate poverty in developing countries."
"International cooperation aimed at promoting these countries' self-sufficiency and independence is the right path towards achieving social and political peace at international level, which will not only fundamentally affect the beneficiary populations, but will also lead to the resolution of Europe's immigration problems."
"I therefore support increased European funding for this cause, as well as the creation of a financial instrument focused exclusively on it."
"In the context of the debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) post-2013, it is particularly important to redefine and reinforce the positions Parliament has adopted on a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation (DCI), given the lessons learned from implementing the DCI during the period 2007-2013."
"To begin with, I consider it essential that this new instrument continue to prioritise achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"In order to achieve this aim - specifically, the eradication of poverty - it is essential that any future instrument be provided with realistic and adequate financial resources."
"The Commission should ensure that EU aid is consistent with development goals and targets set at international level."
"I would also reiterate the importance of how thoroughly eligibility criteria for countries benefiting from funding from this future instrument are applied."
"I would like to stress that the new DCI should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility."
"I believe it should help to ensure proper linkage of relief, rehabilitation and development operations."
"In conclusion, I would congratulate Mr Mitchell on the report he has tabled and I support the suggestions it includes."
"In recent decades, numerous aid programmes have been carried out in developing countries by a variety of public and private organisations."
"As the report shows, the low levels of success achieved to date, lack of coordination with regard to shared objectives (World Health Organisation), and lack of clear indications as to how such objectives should be achieved make it necessary, in my view as well, to introduce a new financing instrument for development cooperation."
"However, this instrument must be intelligently designed, and must be such that it improves the current situation without leading to further waste of resources."
"If this project is to be truly effective, action must be taken on two fronts."
"Firstly, given that the primary objective is the elimination of poverty, genuinely new funds must be allocated to the cause: funds must not be taken away from projects that are already ongoing."
"Secondly, I believe that the European Union needs to commit itself more wholeheartedly to this project."
"Coordinating and sharing tasks need to be the guiding principles for orienting planning in respect of the new development instrument."
"The purpose of this report is to establish Parliament's preliminary position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation (DCI), based on the previous regulation."
"I believe Parliament's involvement at the early stages of the redesign of this instrument will be of great value to it, so I am supporting this initiative."
"I believe the values that characterise European Parliament action, not least the promotion of democracy and the defence of human rights, can contribute positively to constructing a tool that is more compact, effective and comprehensive."
"In my opinion, the way the report analyses this issue is quite interesting: it proposes new approaches that will now have to be debated over the coming months, specifically as regards the need for aid to developing countries that is more differentiated, dividing them into groups."
"It also demonstrates the need for reliable and consistent retrospective analysis work in this area, proposing a new approach to development aid based on greater differentiation, on the involvement of civil society, and on strict eligibility criteria."
"Now that the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been in place for four years, it is time to assess how it has been operating, in order to improve future financial instruments for this area."
"It is now evident that there is a need for Parliament to maintain democratic scrutiny of this financial instrument and future ones; it is even clearer how important it is becoming for developing countries' national parliaments to be involved in drafting strategic national documents linked to aid received from the Union."
"I hope that aid levels will not decrease, but rather will increase wherever possible, and that ways for it to effectively benefit the most deprived populations will be studied."
"Throughout this process, the crucial role that should be attributed to civil society in developing countries cannot be stressed enough."
"The situations in developing countries should not all be approached in the same way, but rather in a more differentiated way, bearing in mind that traditional financial aid can become less important in many cases, for example, in the case of the so-called emerging countries."
"This report, drafted by Mr Mitchell, concerns Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation: lessons learned and perspectives for the future."
"Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 has been in force for four years and it is time to analyse it and learn from any potential errors and/or shortcomings that may exist, since the Commission is aiming to submit proposals before the summer relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period."
"I support the rapporteur's proposals - not least, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the eradication of poverty, the channelling of 20% of resources into health and primary education, particular attention to climate issues, a new approach to aid in developing countries that demands respect for human rights, and the more efficient and effective use of scarce resources - so I voted in favour."
"The report evaluates the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI), four years after the regulation that implemented it came into force."
"The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view."
"Opportune and critical analyses are made of DCI and the EU's development cooperation policy, which we consider fair and necessary."
"The report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU's interests, but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet; it draws attention to the excessive focus on investments to be made by the private sector, as well as the constraints imposed on the public sector; it warns of the need for funds not to be diverted from already underfinanced sectors, giving the example of support for local authorities; it criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund; and it stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA)."
"Nevertheless, we believe the report could and should have gone further on each of these points, especially in advocating consistency between the goals stated in the area of development cooperation policy and the EU's various sectoral policies."
"The report evaluates the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI), four years after the regulation that implemented it came into force."
"The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view."
"Opportune and critical analyses are made of DCI and the EU's development cooperation policy, which we consider fair and necessary."
"For example, the report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU's interests, but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet."
"It draws attention to the excessive focus on investments to be made by the private sector, as well as the constraints imposed on the public sector, and warns of the need for funds not to be diverted from already underfinanced sectors, giving the example of support for local authorities."
"It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund, and stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA)."
"Nevertheless, we believe the report could and should have gone further, on each of these points, especially in advocating consistency between the goals stated in the area of development cooperation policy and the EU's various sectoral policies."
"The report examines the effectiveness of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) in relation to the debate on the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"A reassessment of the overall structure of external funding instruments appears to be appropriate."
"Important aspects that should be considered include possible further simplification, adaptation to new challenges such as climate change, and also the right place for the external dimension of the EU's internal policies."
"In my opinion, it is equally important to establish the procedures and structures which will protect development as an independent area of policy with its own specific objectives."
"I welcome Mr Mitchell's report."
"The purpose of the report is to establish the European Parliament's position with regard to future financing for development cooperation prior to publication of the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework."
"In future, sufficient funds must always be available for EU development cooperation."
"The policy of development aid is neither an altruistic obligation, nor a means for former colonial powers of easing their consciences, where there has been colonisation."
"It is, in its own right, one of the branches of foreign policy; however, it should also be an important part in a strategy for reversing migratory flows that enables populations to remain in or return to their country of origin and live life there with dignity and increasing prosperity."
"Since these two areas fall within the sovereignty of states, most of the institutional and financial requirements of the Mitchell report are not acceptable."
"I welcomed the report because 2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI)."
"The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI."
"I agreed that a differentiated approach to the diverse group of developing countries is needed, and that traditional financial aid may become less relevant for emerging countries."
"I believe that aid for emerging countries, while promoting sustainable economic growth, should still focus on reinforcing the partner country's fiscal policy and promoting mobilisation of domestic revenue which should lead to the reduction of poverty and aid dependence."
"We must refrain from using budget support in countries where transparency in public spending cannot be assured."
"Budget support must always be accompanied by actions to develop the receiving country's parliamentary control and audit capacities and to increase transparency and public access to information, and civil society should be involved in monitoring budget support."
"I believe that the Mitchell report, which is an extremely good report, touches on many key issues, and I therefore decided to vote in favour of it."
"I believe that what matters most when considering the future shape of financing instruments for development is to remember that the overriding aim of development policy should be to reduce dependence on aid gradually, and for the country in question ultimately to achieve total independence."
"In connection with this, financing instruments should be designed in such a way as to ensure long-term economic growth in developing countries."
"Achievement of this goal is closely linked to how predictable development aid is, since it is only on the basis of such aid, at the same time as mobilising domestic revenues, that partner countries can construct an adequate and effective development strategy."
"In my opinion, a further crucial issue is that of increasing the European Parliament's control and influence over the European Development Fund."
"I believe that the lack of democratic control over this fund is detrimental to the transparency of development policy."
"I voted in favour of adopting this report."
"Funding for development cooperation requires well-thought-out regulations, and the report provides a synthesis of what our priorities should be when adopting them."
"The goals pursued by the European Union when establishing this instrument are to ensure special EU assistance for developing countries."
"In view of our current struggle to cope with the financial crisis, the problems of poorer countries are becoming ever more evident."
"The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration, the natural environment and the management of natural resources, infrastructure, water and energy, rural development, agriculture and food security, human development and social cohesion."
"Furthermore, we want to support the development of government systems, democracy, human rights and also economic and institutional reforms, and to prevent conflicts and weakening of the state."
"All the abovementioned goals are of the utmost importance in terms of strengthening security in poorer regions."
"Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a commendable plan."
"I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds."
"in writing. - The future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms."
"The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7% of its GNI on ODA by 2015."
"To reach this aim, the current level of European aid will have to significantly increase."
"Given the added value of Commission aid, and the Commission's new role in coordinating the Union's and the Member States' development policy (Article 210 TFEU), the share of ODA channelled through the EU budget should remain at least stable."
"The annual figures for the new development cooperation instrument in the next MFF period should significantly increase in real terms."
"It is time to assess how the financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been used, now that it has been in place for four years."
"That is the only way we will be able to improve it to make it more effective in the future."
"It is important that Parliament have something to say as regards its scrutiny of this and future financial instruments."
"Despite the economic crisis we are experiencing, it is important to maintain these instruments for aiding developing countries so that they may be able, in the near future, to increase their levels of wealth, with the inherent improvement in the living conditions of the populations in these so-called emerging countries."
"The upcoming instrument for funding development cooperation will have to have sufficient amounts at its disposal at the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"Donor countries should respect their commitment to set aside 0.7% of their GDP to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015."
"As I have already said, nothing justifies a reduction in aid."
"Official Development Assistance currently represents more than USD 120 billion."
"We can do more and better."
"However, doing more and doing better is not just a case of increasing resources."
"The inclusion of the European Development Fund (EDF) in the budget would be significant progress as long as it does not lead to a reduction in total funding amounts at EU level."
"I am also in favour of 'more' budgetary aid, whether general or sector-specific, and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow."
"Firstly, it would make it possible to mobilise financial resources quickly in order to rebuild or consolidate the State."
"Secondly, it is the only kind of aid for which we can be sure that it will be absorbed in an optimal way."
"Finally, I believe that we need to ensure that this aid is more effective."
"in writing. - EU principles of rendering assistance to developing countries which are not covered by the Cotonou Agreement or by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument are very important."
"In terms of this financial instrument, it is possible to render financial aid to ACP countries (African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States) in restructuring the manufacturing of sugar, and financial support for five programmes is envisioned: food security; environment and sustainable development of natural resources, including energy; migration and asylum granting; investment in human resources; the role of local authorities and non-governmental organisations in development processes."
"I voted in favour."
"The fostering of prosperity in so-called developing countries is a necessary measure, particularly in order to prevent a tidal wave of migrants flooding into Europe."
"At present, this is being managed through a variety of programmes."
"However, the aim of this report is to increase financial aid."
"This is something I cannot support."
"In view of the present financial difficulties within the EU, we cannot provide this aid at the moment."
"Furthermore, it is the Member States and not the EU that should determine how development aid is to be used."
"The idea of giving developing countries a helping hand and (also) offering them financial support is something to be warmly welcomed."
"Humanitarian principles and the desire for global balance provide plausible grounds for this."
"The European Union already provides help within the framework of a variety of programmes."
"Nonetheless, this report plans to establish more instruments, thereby expanding development aid."
"However, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, development aid payments should be a matter for the individual states."
"Development cooperation is the only external action policy which defends the most marginalised and vulnerable groups of society."
"The Commission must make every effort to ensure that appropriate and sufficient aid is allocated to the development of the domestic private sector and small- and medium-sized enterprises in low income countries."
"Particular attention must be paid to migration."
"It is important to ensure that money earmarked to combat illegal immigration is used as it was specifically intended."
"Attention should also be drawn to the fact that, when establishing a new financing instrument for developing countries alone, there must be a thorough analysis of the general objectives, the priority areas and expected results, as well as the allocation of funds."
"2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI)."
"The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year."
"The purpose of this report - which I am voting for - is to establish at an early stage Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI over the last four years."
"I would stress the need for the following broad areas to be promoted: adequate funding within the available resources; the effect of poverty eradication and Official Development Assistance (ODA) criteria; geographic and thematic programmes; procedures for programming EU aid, with better coordination and division of labour; and bridging the democracy gap, with Parliament being called on to take part in the decision-making process."
"Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation has been in operation for four years now."
"The Commission will soon present its proposals for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year."
"The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument."
"The report presents the lessons learned, with a particular focus on the experience gained by the European Parliament during its democratic scrutiny of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)."
"Part of the report is dedicated to perspectives for the future and finally, the report looks at geographic and thematic programmes, insisting on strict eligibility criteria for budget support, emphasising the important role that civil society plays in development and the application of the delegated acts procedure for those decisions which fulfil the criteria of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"I voted in favour of this motion so that the European Parliament has the possibility to exercise scrutiny over strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council."
"As four years have passed since Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 came into force, and as the Commission has already announced the tabling of proposals relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2013 period, there is a need for a brief analysis of the results achieved since then and of future means of development."
"The most important thing to stress is that this is 'the one policy area of external action [...] which has not been designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations of this planet'."
"As such, Parliament should take on a more important role, not just because of the various ways that this confers democratic legitimacy, but also because of what it can offer in material and procedural terms."
"It should also be stressed that the objective should be the eradication of poverty, by reference to the concept of 'basic social services', so as to seek to reduce the situation of extreme vulnerability of the most deprived populations."
"in writing. - In favour."
"2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI) has been in operation."
"The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year."
"The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI."
"The purpose of the report adopted today is to establish Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for European Union development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)."
"Contrary to Parliament, Member States did not seem to focus on checking the compliance of Commission proposals with the legal provisions of the DCI."
"It should be clarified, therefore, that development cooperation is the only EU external action policy which has not been designed to serve European Union interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet through poverty alleviation and sustainable human, social and economic development - in short, the right to a decent life for all."
"Parliament clearly recognises the importance of these activities and therefore calls for an instrument which would enable the European Union to finance such actions from sources other than the DCI."
"I voted in favour of Mr Mitchell's report because it defines essential and correct directions for the future adoption and operation of the financing instrument for development cooperation by learning useful lessons from the use currently being made of this development cooperation tool."
"EU funds for development cooperation are a real mechanism for combating poverty and promoting democratisation and development in developing countries."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU has enhanced powers of international representation and is being called on to respond to challenges such as climate change, combating poverty and transferring the rule of law and democratic values to developing countries."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the democratic accountability of all EU development policy and the active role which Parliament must have in the procedure for approving funds for development aid, based on Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, need to be enhanced."
"in writing. - I support this report, which draws on the instrument's performance, scrutiny and promoting better use of development money in the future."
"I voted in favour of the Mitchell report because we need to learn the lessons of the last four years of using Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI)."
"On this occasion, the objectives and scope for this development aid must be very clearly defined."
"Migration is an area where we need to give priority to the coherence of policies promoting development."
"Thus, development aid should finance projects aimed at tackling the deep-rooted causes of migration (fighting against poverty), but it should not be used to improve border control or combat illegal immigration."
"I voted in favour of the text presented by Mr Mitchell."
"In view also of the lessons learned from the implementation of the development cooperation instrument ahead of the introduction of the new post-2013 instrument, I believe that Parliament should have the possibility to defend the specificity of the EU's development policy by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council."
"Furthermore, it is particularly important for decisions on the general objectives, the priority areas and the allocation of funds to be taken using the delegated acts procedure, pursuant to Article 290 TFEU."
"I am voting for this report because the amendments introduced by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) were included in the compromise text."
"These include key points such as general guidelines, the potential for improvement at Commission level and the potential for improvement at Parliament level."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments."
"I agree with the rapporteur that impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future."
"IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision."
"IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making."
"However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic and legitimate decision-making process."
"It should be pointed out that IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision."
"It is important for IAs to be completely independent and transparent and, moreover, the consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account."
"Parliament already has the power to issue its own IAs and submit Commission IAs to thorough scrutiny."
"Hitherto, however, this procedure has rarely been applied."
"I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Parliament should make greater use of the powers it has been given in this field."
"I am convinced that impact assessments would help those who prepare political decisions."
"This is why I supported Mrs Niebler's report on the necessary changes to impact assessments, particularly regarding the introduction of an independent mechanism."
"Members of the Impact Assessment Committee (IAC) would be controlled by the European Parliament and the Council."
"As a result, they would no longer be under the President of the Commission's instructions."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process."
"They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision, and legislators should make greater use of them in future."
"IAs can make a significant contribution to better law making."
"I agree that it is necessary to involve external experts from all policy areas as well as all stakeholder groups affected in the impact assessment process in order to guarantee independence and objectivity."
"Impact assessments (IAs) are an instrument central to the legislative process."
"Rigour requires the gathering of concrete facts for political decision making, and a guarantee that all the relevant strategic options will be examined when any specific problem is being solved."
"Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals, they should have a clear methodology, and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency."
"IAs should also assess the option of inaction, as well as the specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Despite the improvements in this area, IAs by the European Commission and European Parliament could improve even further."
"This report, which I voted for, calls for closer involvement of Parliament's committees and a detailed explanation when the Commission refrains from issuing an IA."
"Finally, it challenges Parliament's committees to increase the use of IAs so as to improve the quality of its law making."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments."
"In the first place, the motion underlines the need, when carrying out impact assessments, to bear in mind the impact of new regulation on small and medium-sized enterprises and to reduce the regulatory burden on them."
"This emphasis on the needs of SMEs was key to my decision to vote in favour."
"In the second place, the motion highlights another very important factor, which is the specific nature of national economies."
"In order to safeguard their interests, the Commission should consult with individual Member States and the officials and representatives of the various national assessment bodies, in order to ensure that specific individual needs are not subordinate to Community interests."
"Finally, the motion calls for greater transparency and efficiency in the European Union's administration processes, urging the Commission to be accountable to Parliament for its work."
"In view of the points described above, I felt compelled to vote in favour."
"I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making, and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission."
"For some time, the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council, but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved."
"For example, we should strengthen the independence of the Impact Assessment Board, which is currently under the authority of the President of the Commission."
"The report also calls on the European Parliament itself and its committees to carry out impact assessments of draft legislation more often and to scrutinise more closely the impact assessments carried out by the Commission, which frequently serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than to permit an objective consideration of the facts."
"Such preliminary impact assessments of proposed EU legislation were further enhanced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which added provisions on the mandatory assessment of the social and environmental impact of any proposed legislation."
"Assertive and successful legislation requires not just good political debate and a joint effort leading to cooperation and consensus, but also a trustworthy technical basis that guides the legislative entities by assessing the context and consequences of the policies in question."
"For this very reason, I welcome the initiatives demonstrated by the European institutions to guarantee the quality and reliability of impact studies, which will involve guaranteeing their independence and transparency."
"in writing. - Having worked on this area at Committee level before, I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels."
"in writing. - I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments."
"UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy."
"Unfortunately, the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria."
"One of the priority goals of European Union policy should be to introduce a transparent, clear, effective and high-quality regulatory environment."
"We have criticised the failings in transposition and implementation of the EU legislation in force numerous times, which result, to a large extent, from the fact that legislative texts have not been drafted properly."
"It is therefore the responsibility of Europe's legislative bodies to face up to this problem."
"Impact assessments (IAs) present a systematic assessment of the probable effects of legislation in health, fundamental rights, social, economic, environmental, etc. terms, thereby contributing to cutting red tape and ensuring the consistency of EU policy."
"I am voting for this initiative, which acknowledges that IAs have a key role in aiding the decision-making process."
"They must be characterised by total independence and transparency, must follow a clear methodology, and must proceed to a substantiated and objective analysis of the potential effects, which is always accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis."
"This will contribute to reaching well thought-out and fully informed decisions, which should lead to better-quality legislation, to more correct transposition, application and oversight, and to a faster legislative process."
"Impact assessments are tools that are especially useful for improving the quality of legislative activities (political proposals, for example)."
"However, these impact assessments need to be adapted: new adaptations are indeed necessary, in particular, through creating an independent mechanism, for the impact assessments proposed by the European Commission are often inconsistent from a qualitative point of view and generally only serve to justify a legislative proposal rather than allow for an objective examination of the facts."
"I am delighted that the report voted today stipulates that impact assessments be carried out totally independently; that impact assessments take a larger range of criteria into account (socio-economic, environmental, etc.); and also that the highest transparency be guaranteed, especially where experts are involved."
"This is a matter that crops up in this Chamber time and time again, but it is nevertheless a highly important one!"
"Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process in that they take into account the potential consequences of applying given legislation, and so help reach a decision for that very reason."
"Independence and transparency are values that should be preserved and encouraged in any democracy in that they guarantee the public objective assessments, proportional decisions and legal procedure."
"I therefore agree, in general, with Parliament's proposals in this report."
"This report, drafted by Mrs Niebler, concerns the problem of 'guaranteeing independent impact assessments'."
"Impact assessments (IAs) are crucial in order for the decisions we make to be the right ones."
"Without replacing the process of democratically deciding legislative authority, they nevertheless constitute the backbone of that same process."
"I am voting for this report because I share the rapporteur's view that IAs are crucial in order for us to carry out our work as law makers."
"The more we know about a given sector, the better our decision making with regard to it will be."
"Moreover, and despite the creation of the Impact Assessment Board (IAB), created by the European Commission, and the positive results already achieved, I also believe it is crucial to create an autonomous IA structure for the European Parliament."
"Impact assessments (IAs) can constitute important support for the legislative process."
"To be so, they must study the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices, along with their impact on the public's fundamental rights, throughout the political cycle."
"The assessment should not just be undertaken ex ante, but also ex post."
"However, the current IA process has numerous failings, as the report acknowledges."
"They often simply seek to convey supposed technical legitimacy and justification on measures that are the result of political choices and evaluations, which are conveniently hidden."
"There remain numerous questions regarding the methodology to be used in each case."
"On what or whom will the impact be measured?"
"What is the scope of the assessment?"
"What alternatives are to be analysed?"
"These decisions, too, normally depend on political choices and evaluations."
"That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent."
"In practice, however, this is difficult, given the multiple variables and interests involved."
"Transparency, openness, consultation, and public participation and scrutiny in connection with the studies and their results are of decisive importance in guaranteeing, as much as possible, this independence and the quality of the study."
"Impact assessments (IAs) can be of significant help from the standpoint of better law making if the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the intended political choices are studied throughout the political cycle, along with their impact on the public's fundamental rights."
"However, in the issues that emerge in impact studies, we have the criteria used in those IAs."
"We know that there are a number of criteria and not just cost-benefit, and even there we need to know who is being hit by costs and who is enjoying benefits."
"That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent but this is, in practice, a very difficult task, given the multiple variables and interests involved."
"The methodologies of some assessments and specialists will be more independent than others."
"In truth, however, IAs often serve more to justify the decisions they are intending to take rather than to really tackle all the implications of the legislation they are intending to adopt."
"Impact assessments are a central instrument of the legislative process, which European law makers must use to the full in future."
"Although they are in no way a substitute for political discussion or the democratic and legitimate decision-making process followed by law makers, and serve only to prepare the ground for political decisions, they draw the attention of law makers to the potential effects of their policies from the perspective of specialised content and help them to take decisions."
"In this way, they can make a considerable contribution to better law making."
"The Niebler report represents an important contribution to the debate on improving the EU legislative procedure, with a view to ensuring that new legislation serves citizens and is genuinely necessary."
"Unfortunately, there have been accusations that regulations are also being created which result merely from the desire to make the EU institutions better known, or from the actions of lobbyists."
"This means that we need to make constant improvements to procedures relating to what is known as the impact assessment for a particular legislative act."
"As rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making, I would like to highlight several aspects of this problem."
"Firstly, we should note the need to maintain the institutional balance enshrined in the Treaty, within which framework the European Commission proposes laws and Parliament and the Council adopt them."
"The independence of impact assessments is extremely important, but they must not be removed from Parliament's democratic control."
"In my opinion, the proposal to modify impact assessments after the introduction of amendments by Parliament is very important, and I also share the opinion of those who believe that we need to apply uniform criteria for impact assessments in all the institutions."
"At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that the most crucial aspect of law making is the political will to resolve a given problem, and an impact assessment prepared as part of a particular project can merely supply objective information."
"I have already had the opportunity to say in this House that it is time indeed that impact assessments be not only systematic, but, above all, credible."
"That we should objectively assess the consequences of a piece of legislation before taking it any further, rather than seeking by all means to justify it."
"And that it is not up to the Commission services, judges, parties and torturers all together to preside over this assessment."
"I do not know whether the solutions put forward by the rapporteur are the right ones."
"On the other hand, I do know that I agree with her diagnosis and that some of her observations are particularly relevant."
"Member States must therefore be closely involved in these studies because they are in a better position to assess the national impact of initiatives coming from Brussels."
"These studies must guide the choices and reflection of national parliaments, who, from now on, are the guardians of the respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"These studies should lead to the abstention of the Commission, if its action turns out to be pointless, redundant or costly."
"Finally, we should be able to quickly draw the consequences of a piece of legislation, the implementation of which creates more problems than it solves."
"For all these reasons, even though I am under no illusions about its realisation, I voted for Mrs Niebler's report."
"I welcomed this report because impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future."
"The benefits of IAs are obvious."
"IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them to make a decision."
"IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making."
"However, IAs can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic and legitimate decision-making process."
"IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision."
"This report falls into four sections."
"First of all, the report sets out the general requirements for IAs at European level."
"The second section discusses the Commission's IAs and highlights scope for improvement."
"The third section is devoted to the IAs carried out by the European Parliament."
"The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous IA structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to further improve law making and create synergies."
"in writing. - I have several reasons why I support this resolution."
"First of all, it underlines that impact assessment can never be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's decision-making process, but should only help the technical preparation of political decisions."
"This would certainly improve the decision-making process."
"Secondly, the impact assessments have to take a large number of criteria into account in order to provide the legislator with a comprehensive picture."
"Only in this way can the legislator do his job efficiently."
"The process of assessing the impacts of a regulation contributes significantly towards reducing the bureaucratic burden that is a by-product of statutory regulation."
"A special Impact Assessment Board was set up at Commission level some time ago, and it assesses impacts both ex ante and ex post."
"The Commission also carries out public consultations on its legislative plans."
"The European Parliament has so far lacked an impact assessment body."
"I therefore applaud the fact that the report calls for the creation of infrastructure making it possible to evaluate the impacts of proposals and plans formulated in Parliament."
"I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently."
"I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union."
"I supported Mrs Niebler's report on guaranteeing independent impact assessments."
"Impact assessments are a key instrument in better law making policy, which aims to improve and simplify new and existing legislation."
"Impact assessments are, in fact, a suitable instrument for evaluating the impact of the adoption of new laws and the simplification and recasting of existing laws."
"However, I believe that recognition of their usefulness should always depend on respect for certain fundamental principles, such as transparency and independence."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the fact that the Commission has recently raised the quality of its impact assessments, while pointing out that further improvements are still needed."
"Finally, I applaud the decision to create an autonomous impact assessment structure for the European Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of European Union law making."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Impact Assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process, of which European legislators should make greater use in future."
"The benefits of IAs are obvious."
"They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them reach a decision."
"IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making."
"However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratically legitimate decision-making process."
"They merely permit the technical and substantive preparation of a political decision."
"The impact assessment instrument presented by the rapporteur is a good way of improving the quality of law making at European level."
"Mutual assessment, however, should take into account not just financial impacts, but should also focus on other aspects, such as the economic, environmental and social aspects."
"As a doctor, I would like to emphasise, above all, the impact on human health."
"We must also not forget the very important role played by Member States in impact assessment, as they must incorporate the proposed legislation into their legal systems."
"Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future, as they show the possible consequences of their policy options."
"We should not forget, however, that they merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision."
"We believe that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles."
"First of all they should be completely independent and transparent."
"They should cover all categories of legislative proposal, employ a clear methodology, and must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process."
"We also believe the Commission should provide Parliament with a detailed explanation in cases where it considers it unnecessary to assess the impact of its decisions."
"Finally, we confirm the importance of the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating new synergies."
"I welcome this text which condemns the European Commission's partiality."
"It is a shame that it does not condemn the fact that the European Commission alone has the power to initiate legislation."
"Impact assessments (IAs) are very important to the legislative process and should be encouraged in the future."
"IAs have great benefits: they alert legislators to the consequences of their options, and contribute to better and more conscious decision making."
"They therefore make a significant contribution to excellence in law making."
"in writing. - I scrutinised the report very attentively and summarised its key points: (1) the scope of scrutiny (not only cost-benefit analysis, but an integrated approach); (2) the inclusion of stakeholders from all the policy areas while the methodology and final quality control should remain under the remit of the European institutions, with an increased consultation period from 8 to 12 weeks; (3) the revision of the interinstitutional common approach to impact assessment to encourage all the institutions to implement a common methodology on IAs."
"Potential for improvement at the Commission level: (1) the increased scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council over the Impact Assessment Board; (2) systematic ex-post assessments of existing legislation and analysis of the relevant ECJ case-law."
"Potential for improvement at EP level: the main focus is the creation of an autonomous structure within the EP led by a supervisory board consisting of MEPs, possibly appointed at the beginning of each term, making use of the existing resources but also of seconded national experts."
"I abstained from voting because I do not understand on which criteria experts for the Advisory Board will be appointed and what power they will have."
"I cannot support the report."
"I voted for this report because I believe impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future."
"The benefits of IAs are obvious."
"They show legislators the possible consequences of their options and help them in making a decision."
"IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making."
"However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic decision-making process, merely enabling the technical preparation of a political decision."
"The European Commission has raised the quality of its IAs, particularly through the foundation of its Impact Assessment Board (IAB)."
"However, in light of the report of the European Court of Auditors, I believe the Commission's IAs could be improved."
"I agree that closer involvement of the European Parliament's committees in this work could be useful in improving the quality of IAs."
"Impact assessments make a significant technical contribution to better law making as they show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options."
"They are a key instrument for the European legislative process."
"The draft report divides these evaluations into four sections."
"The first section takes the view that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles and should be completely independent and transparent."
"The second section discusses the Commission's impact assessments and highlights scope for improvement."
"The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament, which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making."
"The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to create more synergies."
"With regard to the above, and in view of the fact that impact assessments can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratically legitimated decision-making process, but merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision, I voted in favour of the motion."
"in writing. - Impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future."
"The benefits of IAs are obvious."
"They show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them in making a decision."
"IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making."
"However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratically legitimated decision-making process."
"They merely permit the technical, substantive preparation of a political decision."
"The IAs used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles."
"First of all, they should be completely independent and transparent, cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology."
"The policy options listed should also include the option of taking no action."
"The specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account where appropriate and they must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process."
"Parliament's key demand is the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies with the possibility of a common mechanism for all EU institutions."
"in writing. - I welcome this report as I believe impact assessments to be a key instrument in the legislative process."
"European legislators should make greater use of these instruments as they can improve the legislative process by showing the possible impacts of their policy decisions."
"Legislators must not be afraid to state harsh realities when looking at potential impacts."
"Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators, they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course."
"Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible."
"European legislation is too often complex, difficult to understand and difficult to apply."
"This is why impact assessments can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of EU law making, particularly in terms of reducing the timescales and costs of the legislative process."
"I support this measure because, by taking the requirements of Member States into greater consideration, it will be possible to evaluate the possible social, environmental, financial and economic consequences of a legal act."
"Impact assessments should also be completely independent and transparent and be carried out in the early stages of the legislative process."
"The independence of impact assessments (IAs) needs to be guaranteed, above all, because of their importance in the decision-making process."
"As such, while they do not replace the decision of whether or not to adopt a given solution, they can be decisive in shaping the choice of a given political solution."
"It is, therefore, crucial to adopt any measures that might strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent, since that will help maximise this instrument's role as an aid to the decision-making process, and as a guarantee of the quality and suitability of the EU institutions' activities."
"in writing. - We abstained."
"Moreover, we presented an alternative resolution in which we wanted to clarify the role of impact assessment and external experts in the impact assessment process."
"Impact assessment can only be an aid for making political decisions and should never replace political decisions within the democratic decision-making process."
"Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process."
"The benefits are obvious: they make a significant contribution to better law making."
"The report adopted today underlines Parliament's belief that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should be completely independent and transparent."
"They should cover all categories of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology."
"Parliament also calls for the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies."
"in writing. - I welcome S&D amendments to this report at committee stage representing greater transparency in the legislative process and promoting greater ease of access for SMEs and NGOs through the publication of road maps and an extended consultation period."
"Impact assessments are so important to our work in Parliament and should play a greater role, which is why I supported this report."
"The impact assessments (IAs) carried out in the European Union benefit all Europeans because they contribute to better law making through independent analysis of potential and possible European-level measures."
"The rapporteur demonstrates the need to analyse better and more efficiently the economic, social, environmental and public health consequences of the Union's political choices."
"IAs play a key role in a policy's entire development cycle, and are also necessary for high-quality legislation, and for its proper transposition and application."
"I therefore support Parliament's proposed criteria for consideration when IAs are undertaken."
"With regard to this, I should like to stress that these IAs need to be undertaken as early as possible in order to minimise potential negative effects, and to take into account the greatest possible number of institutional, economic and civil stakeholders."
"However, they must not just be promoted prior to a piece of legislation (ex ante), but also following its adoption (ex post)."
"IAs must be independent and undertaken in a transparent and objective way."
"They should accompany legislative proposals and follow a common system and common methodology within the European Parliament."
"Impact assessments are a valuable legislative instrument, serving as a knowledge-based preparation for political decisions, and thus contributing to better law making."
"Transparency, a uniform quality standard and the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of a sufficient number of political options are the key to reliable impact assessments."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the alternative proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"I am voting for this report, but I believe that a potential optional system could be beneficial for consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises if the Commission puts forward concrete data that indicate a need for further progress in order for the consultation carried out by the Commission to remain transparent."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution on the Green Paper from the Commission on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and business."
"Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market; its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious."
"Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular SMEs, and consumers."
"The potential benefits of European contract law to the Internal Market have been discussed for a good many years."
"The EP pronounced itself for the first time on the issue in 1989 and, with this resolution which the EP adopted today, it intends to respond to the recent Commission Green Paper on European contract law, and to set out the Parliament's priorities in this area."
"I support the view of the rapporteur that the option of setting up an optional instrument (OI) for European contract law by virtue of a regulation is to be favoured."
"It could be complemented by a 'toolbox' for Commission and legislator which should be implemented by an interinstitutional agreement."
"The most obvious obstacles which consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises face with regard to the Single Market are complex contractual relations, unfair terms and conditions in contracts, inadequate and insufficient information, time-consuming procedures, language barriers, different taxation systems, reliability of online traders, demographic composition of the population of individual Member States, concerns regarding confidentiality, complaint handling and intellectual property rights."
"European contract law stipulates and regulates Internal Market transactions, and aims to resolve problems relating to the Single Market which have arisen for various reasons, including even differences in contract law legislation."
"This makes it vital to provide a coherent European contract law regime in order to achieve the Internal Market's full potential and help meet our Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers."
"This is why I voted in favour of this report."
"The potential advantages of a European contract law for the Single Market have been debated a great deal over these last few years."
"In this regard, I think that we need to support the introduction of an optional instrument by way of regulation so that this parallel system does not work against national systems."
"This is the approach chosen by Mrs Wallis' report and I therefore supported it."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"In the wake of the global financial crisis, it is very important to realise the full potential of the Internal Market, and thus help meet the strategic goals of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Today, owing to many factors, including a failure to implement existing single market legislation, the Single Market remains fragmented."
"Consumers have no confidence in cross-border commerce and companies face huge administrative and legal difficulties if they want to expand their activities in other EU Member States."
"Divergence of contract law at national level leads to additional transaction costs, legal uncertainty for companies and a lack of consumer confidence in the Internal Market."
"It is partly for these reasons that consumers and enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited resources, avoid cross-border transactions, which prevents the creation of a competitive Internal Market."
"I agree with the report's call to take action and propose methods of harmonising contract law practice at EU level, which would ensure equal and fair conditions for market participants."
"Contracts are the fundamental links in relationships between companies and consumers."
"The European Union's Single Market is founded on a variety of contracts regulated by various national-level bodies of law."
"These differences in contract law discourage companies, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, from dedicating themselves to cross-border trade, thus preventing them from accessing the new opportunities and income offered by the Internal Market."
"Furthermore, consumers are disadvantaged by limited choice, high prices and lower quality because of weak cross-border competition."
"It should be noted, for example, that only 8% of consumers buy online from other Member States."
"This report, which I voted for, advocates the need for an Optional Instrument (OI) for European-level contract law in the form of a regulation."
"This will enable consumers to enjoy better protection under the umbrella of European contract law, and better security when they make cross-border transfers."
"For their part, companies - SMEs in particular - will find it easier and less costly to conclude contracts under the umbrella of a common body of EU contract law."
"I voted against Mrs Wallis's report because the optional instrument envisaged, based on a regulation, basically marks the first step towards harmonising contract law in Member States."
"I think that such harmonisation, even to a minimal extent, is inconceivable at the present stage in view of the different way contractual relations are regulated in Member States."
"For example, there is the right in rem effect, which does not feature in German law."
"Apart from this, harmonisation of contract law would not prevent the discrepancies in other areas influencing transnational trade within the EU."
"There is no categorical proof indicating that it is these legal differences which are preventing transactions from being completed with foreign companies and consumers."
"Contracts with an international element are currently drawn up based on international private law and, at EU level, on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008."
"An additional instrument would introduce unnecessary confusion."
"With regard to contractual relations without any international element, I think that every Member State must continue to apply its own national legislation, according to its legal tradition and established practices."
"I voted against a report that proposes an optional legal instrument for contract law, effectively laying the foundations for a future body of European civil law, to take precedence over domestic civil laws."
"This would mean the end of national legal traditions and the laws that every Member State has laid down on issues as sensitive as civil and contract law."
"In any case, although the objective of introducing an optional instrument is to facilitate cross-border trade, taking the needs of consumers and companies into due account, it must be borne in mind that existing European legislation already satisfies the needs of the various actors involved."
"The real objective of the report therefore appears to be more ambitious than the creation of a European civil code, with which I cannot agree."
"I offer my congratulations on the work carried out by the rapporteur, for which I voted."
"This report responds to the needs of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises, which, unlike other actors representing bigger economic entities, have obvious difficulties accessing the Internal Market because of the enormous costs they have to bear."
"As a direct result, both SMEs and consumers tend to carry out transactions within the domestic market, which is often much less competitive, and therefore do not access the cross-border market, in which products are often at least 10% cheaper than the domestic offer."
"The divergence in contract law rights must be remedied, and the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation, which would flank rather than replace Member States' national contract law systems, is an optimal solution that would give the parties the freedom to choose the legal instrument most suited to their needs."
"in writing. - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law as I do not believe Brussels should be making legislation where national legislation already exists."
"By introducing EU contract law and making it optional for businesses to choose domestic or European legislation, it confuses the system and will create legislative overlaps that may result in expensive tribunals."
"It is also likely that EU contract law will favour EU social and employment policy, such as the Working Time Directive, which has both proven highly unpopular and caused disruption in the UK for a range of essential industries and services."
"It is also highly likely that legislation that, for the time being, carries a discretional opt-in will later be made obligatory by the EU."
"The Wallis report sets ambitious objectives in respect of conceivable measures with a view to establishing a European contract law for consumers and businesses."
"The issues at stake are crucial since this is about improving how the Internal Market works by including businesses and consumers more."
"On the one hand, we need to get rid of the differences in terms of contract law so as to remove the obstacles facing businesses."
"On the other hand, we need to ensure a high level of protection for European consumers."
"Given the significant impact of contract law on financial transactions and, therefore, on the Internal Market, I welcome all the efforts made by the Commission and the European Parliament towards harmonising their parameters within the EU and adapting them to the Single Market."
"I am voting for the report tabled on this issue."
"in writing. - Many recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence and this is, in part, borne from proper laws to protect consumers in the marketplace."
"As such, it is imperative that this issue is addressed on a European level."
"The Wallis report is an important step in implementing the Single Market Act, and I am delighted about its adoption."
"At a time when differences in national laws restrict cross-border trade substantially, especially for SMEs, introducing a framework for European contract law is a real step forward that we should support."
"By regulating both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contractual relations, adopting an optional instrument together with a 'toolbox' could ensure enhanced protection of consumers in Europe."
"The existence of European-level contract law, which has been debated at length within the institutions, could represent a range of benefits for businesses, for consumers and for the smooth running of the Internal Market."
"We are therefore not indifferent to the potential linked to the existence of a common body of general standards and principles applicable to contract law, in terms of increasing cross-border transactions, of regulating e-commerce and of improving consumers' access to products."
"However, and as argued by the rapporteur, I believe that an optional instrument for European contract law that exists alongside national legislation, but does not replace, is a suitable choice."
"This report, by Mrs Wallis, concerns policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses."
"A correct option in terms of European contract law could benefit the Internal Market, small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers."
"This issue has been current in the European Parliament since 1989, which led the Commission to draw up an action plan in 2003."
"The commission tabled a proposal for a directive on consumer rights in 2008, has drafted two progress reports and has now tabled a series of measures in the form of a Green Paper, to which this report seeks to respond."
"Given that the proposals tabled - following ten years of studies - will contribute to solving the detected failings, which are essentially to do with contracts, and that there is a need to promote the Internal Market by removing barriers, I am voting for this report, which introduces an optional instrument (OI) that could be complemented with 'a toolbox' aimed at resolving the problem of contracts."
"The report seeks to dress itself up in rhetoric surrounding the defence of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"Its context, however, includes dangers for both: consumers & SMEs."
"The rapporteur's vision is markedly neoliberal, as is clear from the stress given to breaking down 'barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that, along with other measures, the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market'."
"The liberalisations and deepening of the Internal Market that the EU has been carrying out demonstrate that it is big business that benefits above all."
"The present dynamics suggest that proposals for the harmonisation of contracts - still optional at this stage - will be implemented with these same interests at the forefront."
"These reservations are borne out by statements in the report, such as that the optional instrument 'must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law'."
"It also stresses that the instrument proposed at EU-level, which is the same for all contracts in the European Union, is also set out in very general terms."
"This is a clearly neoliberal report that is concerned with the interests of businesses - larger businesses in particular - because in a totally liberalised Internal Market, it is those with power who gain the most, despite the propaganda about defending small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers."
"However, all this is an attempt to dress up the product in order to hide its real dangers from the electorate."
"Therefore, we are not voting in favour of the report."
"It also advocates an EU-level instrument, albeit optional, that is the same for all contracts in the European Union, which is also set out in very general terms."
"Here are some statements made in the report:"
"'Supports action to address the range of barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that, along with other measures, the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market';"
"'Believes that both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts should be covered; emphasises that the [optional instrument] must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law; wishes for further explanation on how this could be achieved'."
"Contract law determines and organises transactions in the Single Market."
"By selecting the right way forwards in the area of contract law, it is possible to contribute in a significant way to the better functioning of the Single Market and to making its full potential available to businesses (especially small and medium-sized ones) and consumers."
"Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers, I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers, particularly in cross-border transactions."
"The broad and balanced involvement of the participants is of fundamental importance."
"It will be particularly decisive during the legislative process, and all available resources will be required in order to ensure inclusivity and transparency."
"We need diverse impact assessment, drawing on a broad range of policy options and focusing on the practical issues that are important for the operation of an optional instrument."
"What Mrs Wallis is proposing is nothing short of creating a 28th legal system, in addition to national laws, which it intends to replace in practice; the words legislative 'harmonisation' and 'standardisation' are now feared in the European political context."
"This new European law is supposed to remove barriers to cross-border trade, arising from the differences between national legal systems."
"The problem is that nothing in Mrs Wallis' report proves the objective existence of such barriers, and therefore of a problem that needs to be solved."
"Consequently, nothing, except the will to initiate a new method of imposing supranational legislation, justifies such a position."
"In addition, it would run the real risk of being used to bypass protective national provisions, especially in relation to consumer rights."
"That is why I voted against this report."
"I abstained from voting on this report because, according to the rapporteur, complexity in contractual relations is one of the most evident impediments that consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face in the Single Market."
"Hence, the proposal to establish a common European contract law, which would benefit consumers and help ensure increased cross-border trade within the Internal Market."
"According to the rapporteur, all parties, be it in business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, should be free to choose or not to choose the optional instrument (OI) as an alternative to national or international law (opt-in)."
"Further attention is required to ensure that the OI offers protection to consumers and small businesses given their position as the weaker commercial partner and that any confusion is avoided when making a choice of law."
"I abstained from voting because the EU recently adopted the Rome I Regulation, which regulates this area and defends consumer rights well, whereas this proposal is purely based on the UK situation and would only cause turbulence and increased bureaucracy."
"I do not support the proposal to create an entirely new legal instrument in the form of a European contract law."
"The creation of this instrument is the first step towards the creation of a pan-European civil code, which would gradually replace the contract law of the individual Member States."
"The proposed concept may talk about the voluntary application of this instrument, but nevertheless it is clear from many indications that volunteering is only a kind of precursor to a subsequent mandatory application in cross-border contractual relationships."
"If this instrument is created, we will be introducing a completely new type of supranational law, which will be on the boundary between EU law and international private and commercial law, not to mention the fact that the mandate for creating a European contract law for consumers and businesses does not have sufficient support in primary EU law."
"We should therefore stick to a standard instrument, for which there is sufficient legal support in primary law in the form of harmonisation."
"When it comes to implementing the common market, we should not make do with removing the positive barriers between the Member States of the Union."
"To enjoy the fruits of an effective integrated market, it is also necessary to tackle the indirect causes that stifle the cross-border aspirations of our fellow citizens."
"On top of a number of administrative difficulties, European entrepreneurs are too often faced with very diverse contractual regulations in force in the Member States."
"These obstacles are particularly difficult to overcome for SMEs, which nevertheless are the most effective tool for boosting growth."
"As a result, the European Commission has published a Green Paper on the subject and launched a broad public consultation."
"I voted for Parliament's present resolution for it takes a common sense approach by proposing an instrument that is concurrent with national legislation and would facilitate cross-border trade."
"This 'European contract' would be optional, would come with a 'toolbox' to clarify how it should be used and it would encourage greater protection of consumers."
"in writing. - I voted against this report."
"Divergences in European contract law end up discouraging businesses from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers."
"Consequently, consumers are also disadvantaged by limited product choice, higher prices and lower quality due to weak cross-border competition."
"In this regard, we wish to introduce some innovations, including business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties' choice, and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments."
"Simplicity and readiness for use should be a key objective."
"Provisions on sale of goods merit priority, as do service contracts."
"Finally, the introduction of a trust mark system would ensure additional consumer protection."
"Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers."
"Although I believe that there is still a lot to be done in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and of consumer rights, this report is a first step in facilitating cross-border trade between SMEs."
"in writing. - Labour Euro MPs want to see improvements in the Single Market and to facilitate cross-border transactions for consumers and small businesses."
"However, consumer and business groups have come together on this issue to reject Mrs Wallis' proposal of an optional instrument of contract law."
"They maintain that rules of national contract law are not a factor in influencing consumer attitudes to buying from another Member State; in fact, there are other genuine barriers to cross-border trade, such as administrative and cultural differences and a lack of effective means of redress for consumers."
"Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument."
"Indeed, such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights."
"We need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the Green Paper and make an evidence-based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments."
"Similarly, we cannot accept the ECR toolbox-based approach without sufficient evidence and impact assessment to demonstrate that this is the best way to protect consumers and help businesses."
"We owe it to our consumers and businesses to make the right decision for them and ensure that any change of law affecting their rights is properly thought through."
"Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market, so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious."
"Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers."
"It merits attention that the Parliament has, in its various resolutions on this matter, repeatedly acknowledged the benefits an improved contract law framework has on the Internal Market, has further welcomed the idea of a common frame of reference, and has insisted on close involvement of itself and the stakeholders concerned."
"in writing. - On 1 July 2010, the Commission presented a Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses."
"The policy options include soft law options, an opt-in regime called the 28th system, the unlikely approximation of substantive national law (because of resistance by the Council and the impossibility of overnight merging of national legal traditions) and the option of creating a fully fledged European civil code."
"I totally support the report, especially in the context of human rights violations in the Latvian Republic."
"I voted in favour."
"European contract law should ensure a more smoothly-running Internal Market and this report draws particular attention to the potential benefits for SMEs and consumers."
"The related efforts to find a common legal framework here have been ongoing since 1989."
"In 2008, the EU Commission circulated a proposal for a directive on consumer rights."
"It is of far greater importance for Europe's consumers that consumer protection should be improved at EU level."
"This should not take the form of restrictive actions, such as those once familiar when bank accounts were overdrawn, but instead should combat shady business practices, fraud, etc."
"It is open to question whether European contract law will improve market access for small enterprises because, according to analyses, it is mainly medium to large-sized retail businesses that are involved in cross-border trade, something that is due to the bureaucratic red tape entailed, as well as the costs."
"The existing problems with cross-border online shopping will persist for some time to come."
"Furthermore, it has not been established beyond all doubt that standardisation is really necessary."
"When in doubt, I back the principle of subsidiarity, which is why I am voting against the Wallis report."
"A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands, subsidiarity and national sovereignty."
"Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted."
"I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important, namely, EU-wide consumer protection, is still in need of improvement."
"It is for that reason that I am voting against this report."
"A unified contract law regime must be applied in the European Union."
"Above all, this would remove obstacles often faced by consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Single Market relating to the complexity of contractual relations."
"Furthermore, a common European contract law would ensure increased cross-border trade in the Internal Market."
"The Rome I Regulation currently in force is an adequate regulatory instrument, which provides for a high level of protection of the weaker contractual party."
"The provisions of this regulation protect consumers when seeking redress from businesses in other Member States with whom they have entered into a contract. Given that a well-functioning legal regulation mechanism is already in force in this area in the European Union, I do not endorse this resolution on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses, which proposes adopting a new regulation, which would set up a new optional instrument, to be applied in business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions."
"Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new regulation would result in much confusion and a lack of clarity in this area."
"Furthermore, its implementation would require additional funding and increased bureaucracy."
"Divergences in contract law in the Member States create structural problems that discourage businesses and consumers."
"Mrs Wallis's motion for a resolution favours the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law for consumers and businesses by virtue of a general regulation, and this is why I voted in favour of the text."
"Furthermore, the instrument would not replace Member States' contract laws, but would merely help ensure a better choice of contract model between the parties, thanks to examples based on general principles, definitions and model regulations for both commercial and consumer contracts, without going against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"I voted in favour of the report on the creation of a European law of contract for consumers and businesses which will help to facilitate cross-border transactions and strengthen the Internal Market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers."
"The differences in contract law between the various Member States are slowing down SMEs wishing to carry out cross-border transactions."
"We need to adopt a flexible procedure that will provide security to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers and help to protect the parties' rights."
"That is why creating an optional instrument that will operate as a standard for SMEs alongside national rules, by broadening the parties' options, is the right strategy."
"I voted for this report on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses."
"In fact, contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market, so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious."
"Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and consumers."
"I would stress the need for broad and balanced stakeholder involvement."
"The present Commission working method involving an expert and a stakeholder group already ensures the participation of stakeholders."
"However, as the process has not yet left the consultation phase, it is important to ensure that the legislative procedure itself does not start yet."
"Stakeholder involvement will be particularly essential during that legislative procedure, the inclusivity and transparency of which will have to be ensured by all available means."
"in writing. - The EU cannot claim to be a single market if obstacles to trade still exist."
"The immense costs incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier."
"Between legal fees, translation fees and implementation fees, it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State."
"According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey in 2008, this barrier is seen as a major concern by up to 60% of retailers."
"If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU, small and medium businesses (SMEs) and consumers in all Member States would benefit."
"The removal of these barriers would encourage more SMEs to exploit the potential of e-commerce."
"I believe SMEs are crucial for economic recovery in many Member States."
"Ireland's path to recovery is being export-led; thus the removal of barriers entering in the EU market is crucial."
"The findings and recommendations of this report also show the potential for great benefits for consumers."
"If cross-border trade increases, consumers will be offered a wider choice of products and more competitive prices."
"One of the most burning issues in EU law involves the harmonisation of contract law."
"On the one hand, it seems that the need for greater internal consistency is being felt, in order that companies can benefit from the common market's potential without fearing that there might be solutions in a given foreign legal system that they had not anticipated and for which they had not prepared, which has been a real problem."
"On the other, however, there is a certain resistance amongst Member States to sacrificing their legal solutions, which is hardly surprising given that these have developed over centuries and that they are widely known by their respective populations."
"As such, in its Green Paper of 1 July 2010, the Commission tabled several solutions for regulatory models ranging from mere soft law to a European civil code."
"Of the various hypotheses, the European Parliament is in favour of the creation of an optional instrument in the form of a regulation, that governs cross-border transactions first of all, and that can potentially also be used for internal contracts, albeit optionally."
"This seems like a reasonable solution to me, so I voted in favour."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The report intends to respond to the recent Commission Green Paper on European contract law and to set out the Parliament's priorities in this area."
"The potential benefits of European contract law for the Internal Market have been discussed in the interinstitutional framework and with the broad public for a many years, and Parliament pronounced for the first time on the issue in 1989."
"The Commission broadened the debate by issuing its communication of 2001, focusing on possible problems which divergences in contract law might raise within the Internal Market and on possible options for action."
"Within the light of the responses to this consultation, the Commission issued an action plan in 2003, proposing, inter alia, the elaboration of a common frame of reference and containing definitions, common principles and model rules, with a view to improving the quality and coherence of European contract law."
"In a further communication, in 2004, the Commission set out the follow-up to that action plan and also proposed to review the Union acquis in this area."
"In 2008, it submitted a proposal for a directive on consumer rights."
"I consider that we need to improve the operation of the Internal Market and explore every avenue that will benefit businesses, especially SMEs, and consumers."
"Within this framework, Mrs Wallis's report is a move in the right direction: it refers to the adverse impact which differences in contract law within the Internal Market are having both on consumers and on businesses, and to the benefits to the Internal Market of an improved contract law framework."
"I consider that, in order to achieve this, we need to create a user-friendly, flexible, clear legislative act which, where feasible, is binding on the Member States and which will facilitate and provide security of law to contracting parties, without interfering in national laws and without affecting the financially weaker."
"in writing. - I am disappointed that this report has passed through Parliament."
"I was unable to support it because, as a response to a Commission Green Paper, it ruled out far too many options for the future of an EU contract law and neglected a duty to request an impact assessment on the full costs and implications of each of the Commission's options."
"As yet, there is no European contract law, even though the option of such a law has been debated within European institutions for over 20 years."
"The Commission now intends to propose, by way of regulation, the introduction of an optional instrument, commonly referred to as the '28th law', which could govern cross-border contracts."
"Whilst the intention to simplify contract law and expand cross-border trade is commendable, I nonetheless have doubts about the relevance of this approach: indeed there is a high risk that national rules, which provide maximum protection for consumers, will be bypassed."
"For this reason, I have decided to abstain on this own-initiative report, pending the Commission's proposal for a regulation on this matter."
"One consequence of the implementation of the Internal Market is an increase in the number of potential consumers in the European Union."
"To date, however, there has been no European-level harmonisation of the rules on contracts for consumers and businesses."
"This results in the constant presence of obstacles to the Internal Market's full implementation because of differences in the law at national level, and because of the fragmentation of consumer law itself."
"The report's proposal is to analyse the viability of an optional instrument in this area, formalised with a regulation and complemented with a 'toolbox', which would make it possible to ensure legal certainty and security."
"Such an instrument would make the Single Market run more smoothly, would benefit businesses and consumers, and would also be advantageous to the legal systems of the Member States themselves."
"For the above reasons, I voted for this report and I support a European Commission proposal on this matter, which should, in future, involve the European Parliament itself, as well as economic and civil-society stakeholders."
"The fact that we have 27 legal regimes is one of the most formidable barriers encountered by entrepreneurs and consumers in the EU who wish to take advantage of the benefits of the Internal Market."
"The work in progress on the establishment of an alternative EU contract law fills me with optimism, particularly in the context of the EU's Digital Agenda and e-commerce's potential for the Single Market."
"The rapporteur favours an optional instrument."
"Consumer protection organisations are already sceptical about the EU's approach to this topic."
"On the one hand, they question the causal link with the basis for future contract law, while also, more importantly, fearing a further complication of the legal situation."
"At present, a 'toolbox' is the preferred option because this would meet current needs and special provisions in relation to the most common types of contract would be a genuine aid for consumers."
"However, all options should be kept open and examined at present."
"I voted in favour of the text presented by Mrs Wallis."
"The problems deriving from divergences in Member States' contract laws often discourage businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers."
"The text voted on today aims to create an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation."
"This optional instrument would stand alongside Member States' contract laws as an alternative option which the contractual parties would be free to choose."
"Sixty percent of Internet transactions within the European Union fail, mainly due to the fact that the parties involved in such transactions are afraid of the unfamiliar legal systems of other Member States."
"In this situation, many EU citizens are deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of the online market."
"In this instance, the differences that exist between the legal systems of the Member States constitute a barrier to the proper functioning of the EU market."
"I therefore also believe that an optional instrument, or a '28th legal regime', stands a good chance of helping to unlock the potential of the European market in the field of e-commerce, and of helping to expand the market for entrepreneurs while guaranteeing equal access to goods and services for consumers."
"I am voting for this report because it includes a range of concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), by acknowledging the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) and the need to include additional indicators to measure economic and social progress in the medium and long terms."
"I would also draw attention to the establishment of clear and measurable indicators that take into account climate change, biodiversity, efficient resource utilisation and social inclusion, which could help lead to a more inclusive society based on knowledge, and to lower carbon emissions."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world."
"GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world."
"It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general."
"Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost."
"I therefore welcome the provision set out in the resolution that we need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress, and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion."
"We also need to develop indicators that reflect the household level more accurately: income, consumption and wealth."
"It is therefore important to develop a tool to complement GDP."
"It should be developed so that it can be applied in a practical way, using clearly defined indicators and relying on high-quality data."
"Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity."
"It was developed in the 1930s and is used by political decision makers in discussions as an indicator of growth in their countries."
"In the light of the ever closer degree of interdependence between economic, social and environmental issues, GDP today suffers from many shortcomings, as it does not record important social factors such as well-being, social inclusion, climate change or resource efficiency."
"Therefore, in a context in which the correlation between a range of non-market activities and GDP is no longer automatic, there is a need to develop additional clear and measurable medium- and long-term indicators that ensure comparability between countries and regions and that can be used for projecting future developments and designing policies."
"I would like to support the adoption of a clearly defined measuring system which will go beyond GDP, in the sense of complementing GDP in the context of making and assessing decisions."
"GDP is an indicator of economic market activity which has become a benchmark used by policy makers."
"The need to improve data and indicators to complement GDP as part of assessing society's overall development is increasingly recognised by all international institutions."
"This report emphasises the need to measure the quality of life in societies."
"Achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing and environmental conditions."
"I support the establishment of a solid legal framework for European environmental economic accounts and encourage the need to compile reliable, harmonised statistics."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because it stresses the importance of agreeing on a systemic approach to setting up a coherent 'Beyond GDP system' to contribute to improved policy analysis."
"GDP is an indicator of economic activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world."
"But GDP is only a measure of production."
"It does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general."
"Therefore, it can be misleading."
"We need to measure quality of life in societies; we need to consider that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, consensual factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing, environmental conditions, etc. For these reasons, this report deserves to be given the highest consideration."
"It takes the view that indicators which measure such factors should be assigned a greater role."
"As the Stieglitz Committee demonstrated in France in 2008-2009, we need to think of new development indicators to add to GDP."
"Hitherto a key reference, despite leading to possible errors of appreciation (for instance, the rebuilding that follows natural disasters is recorded as economic progress), GDP on its own will no longer do."
"I voted for Mrs Rosbach's report since it calls on the Commission to continue its research in this area by challenging the reluctance of the Conservatives who believe that only GDP is reliable and the illusions of a section of the left who would like us to measure precisely ... happiness!"
"The Commission's work will have to be closely monitored because it could lead to an important development: a new, more appropriate method of calculating how European funding is allocated to the regions (regional policy)."
"Until now, funding has been granted on the basis of GDP per person in the regions concerned."
"Gross domestic product (GDP) is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world and is best known as a measure of macro-economic activity."
"GDP does not reflect current environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general."
"I agree with the Commission's proposal to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress, and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion."
"For many years, GDP has been the main index for economic assessment, but its shortcomings are increasingly apparent when it comes to assessing social or environmental progress."
"Hence, the importance of this resolution which insists on the need for the European Union to adopt other indicators in addition to GDP in order to take better account of, among other things, climate change, biodiversity or even social integration, these being major political challenges that are close to my heart."
"I voted for this report because defining and implementing a new range of indicators is an important challenge for measuring the quality of life of European citizens more accurately, and improving the political answers that cannot be drawn up solely on the basis of GDP."
"I think that this initiative is the first encouraging step towards greater account being taken of social and environmental issues in European public policies."
"However, to be fully useful and effective, this will have to be followed by the genuine introduction of a new range of indicators as well as their effective and coherent political use, so that they are not turned into gimmicks but, well and truly, into genuine tools that help with decision making."
"Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity."
"It was developed in the 1930s and has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general."
"A series of international initiatives highlighted broad support by policy makers and experts from the fields of economics, environmental protection and civil society for the development of indicators to complement GDP, providing more comprehensive information to support policy making."
"GDP does not, in fact, provide a reliable basis for policy debate."
"In particular, it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration."
"In the political and scientific discussion that has been going on for years, I believe the problem is more about how this approach can be achieved using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators."
"At European and Member State level, there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps in these areas."
"Unfortunately, there are only partial signs of coherent action."
"Therefore, while I acknowledge the importance of adopting a clearly defined system for measuring GDP, I call on the Commission to submit, in the first instance, a tiered strategy that shows how the new 'Beyond GDP' approach can be used in day-to-day political work."
"I welcome the Rosbach report because it clearly defines GDP as an indicator of the economic activity of the market and production in the relevant country, but which does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress."
"A high GDP, even when calculated per capita, can be misleading because GDP is not distributed equally among the population, which is why it is not a good indicator of quality of life in a society."
"To enable us to cope with current and future problems, new indicators need to be devised which will complement and further refine GDP."
"This will allow us not only to define the quality of life more accurately, but these indicators will also provide a more reliable knowledge base, which will contribute to a better analysis of the policies in different areas."
"The report by Mrs Rosbach is a critical analysis of the Commission's communication 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world'."
"While the Commission's aim - to adopt a measuring system that would go beyond gross domestic product to provide a more comprehensive picture of a country's progress and development, including, for example, environmental sustainability and social inclusion - is important and non-controversial, the rapporteur questions the strategy that the Commission is proposing to achieve it."
"The initiatives suggested are not, in fact, part of a tiered, pragmatic strategy indicating how the new 'Beyond GDP' approach should be used."
"I share this view, and therefore I voted in favour of Mrs Rosbach's report."
"I voted for this report because I believe that it is only by using proper instruments that we can have a realistic view of the situation, and therefore do our best to change it if necessary."
"Gross domestic product, or GDP, is an instrument designed to indicate the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities."
"It is easy to see how a wealth indicator based on dated parameters is anachronistic now, in 2011."
"I believe we should introduce new indicators for measuring GDP, such as environmental sustainability and social inclusion, so that all the information making up GDP provides a truer picture of the country or region to which it refers."
"Adapting to the times means taking into consideration all the important variables, without falling into the trap of creating an excessively artificial system, which would be difficult to apply."
"I believe that, with clearly defined indicators, the work can be carried out in the best possible way."
"Although gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of production that is useful for economic market activity, it does not take into account the sustainability of the development demonstrated, or environmental and social aspects, etc. I therefore welcome the 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' initiative, which aims to encourage and raise awareness of the use of other complementary GDP indicators when evaluating and discussing politics."
"I believe this system of measurement based on corroborating various study parameters will lead to political decisions more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general."
"in writing. - While academics will argue over the best possible way to measure progress, we as European legislatures must be confident in the method we pick and ensure that it stands up to argument both today and in the future."
"Economic literature has been asking for years whether it is necessary to continue using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator of the progress made by a geographic area over a given period of time."
"I believe that there is currently no other indicator that is as concise or complete."
"We cannot present our citizens, who are caught up in their own everyday problems, with a clinical file describing the state of the economy."
"At the same time, we cannot insist exclusively on strictly economic indicators, which are not always able to pick up on social phenomena."
"I therefore agree with the report's general objective."
"We should join forces with the international academic community and try to move beyond GDP."
"There are plenty of examples all over the world, from the UN Human Development Index to Bhutan's Gross National Happiness index."
"It is necessary to identify the priority objectives and measure their achievement strictly, accurately and in a way that cannot be distorted by vested interests."
"We need to remember that it does not matter how many watches we have, but how we spend our time."
"I voted for this report because I think that indicators need to be found to complement GDP and help us measure factors such as climate change, biodiversity or resource efficiency."
"As Joseph Stiglitz expressed it so well, GDP is not only an instrument which is inadequate for reflecting citizens' welfare, but it is also restricted to measuring economic market activity."
"I hope that the European executive will come up with specific proposals for additional, more extensive and sustainable indicators so as to remedy the current shortcomings."
"Indicators are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon."
"Simple phenomena can be interpreted using simple indicators, while complex phenomena require complex indicators."
"Gross domestic product is a simple indicator, while development is a complex phenomenon."
"Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment."
"Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how (people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples), and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks (ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example)."
"In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy."
"For these reasons, the European Commission's efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended."
"The report that we have adopted seems to me to be moving in this direction."
"in writing. - GDP (gross domestic product) is the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities."
"It is the most widely known and used measure of macro-economic activity."
"Indeed, GDP has become the primary indicator for overall societal development and progress in general."
"There is growing international recognition of the inadequacy of GDP as an indicator of social progress, social inclusion, environmental sustainability and resource efficiency."
"I support this report which calls for the development of clear and measurable indicators that take account of climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion."
"It further underlines the need to measure quality of life in societies, considering that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, consensual factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing, and environmental conditions."
"It also fully supports the establishment of a solid legal framework for the European Environmental Economic Accounts as a positive step in the 'GDP and beyond' process, and, indeed, welcomes the Commission initiative to present an index for environmental pressure, to be submitted alongside GDP."
"Despite all the more or less sentimental constructions that we might make, the truth is that it is by analysing gross domestic product (GDP) that we can achieve a reliable image of societies' state of development and progress."
"That is why GDP is - and should continue to be - the main economic indicator to be taken into account."
"However, it should be complemented, wherever appropriate, with other indicators, which should be studied and introduced gradually."
"In 2007, the European Parliament, alongside the Commission, the Club of Rome, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), organised a conference on the theme of 'Beyond GDP', at which those involved advocated the need to develop other indicators complementary to gross domestic product (GDP)."
"This report, by Mrs Rosbach, is based on a communication tabled by the Commission on 28 September 2009 called 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world', and it reflects this need to provide politicians and researchers with data that is more comprehensive."
"Over recent decades, gross domestic product (GDP) has been the most-used unit of macro-economic measurement, and has started to be used most recently as an indicator of social development."
"A number of sociologists have been arguing, most recently, that this is not the best indicator as it does not consider aspects such as sustainability or social integration."
"Since I agree with the rapporteur's position, I voted for her report, but I believe that the proposal can, and must, be improved by tabling a strategy that is more comprehensive and gradual."
"The neoliberal guidelines and policies implemented by the EU have endangered social progress and inflicted severe blows on Europe's peoples."
"The exacerbation of social inequalities in the countries of the EU, which are currently reaching worrying levels, is a telling example of this."
"This is something we should keep in mind when we analyse development and progress indicators, as this report does."
"Gross domestic product (GDP) is frequently used as a basis for assessing these two factors - development and progress - and is a statistical indicator with natural shortcomings."
"By taking into account only economic activity - wealth creation - and being useful, therefore, in determining economic growth, it does not cover parameters as important as wealth distribution, social inequalities, the quality of goods and services, non-commercial transactions or even outcomes not recorded by the market, which are essential to the assessment of development and progress."
"In many situations, GDP can increase while the majority of a country's citizens become poorer, because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society."
"For all these reasons, it becomes necessary to take into account any other indicators that might overcome these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete, credible and close to reality as possible."
"There are increasingly large economic divergences and social inequalities caused by the EU's neoliberal guidelines and policies, and by the increasingly unfair sharing and distribution of national income, both at EU level and at national level."
"It is therefore increasingly controversial to use gross domestic product (GDP) as a basis for working with social development and progress, and a statistical indicator for measuring them."
"It is a statistical indicator with many shortcomings, since it takes into account only economic activity, leaving aside other important factors like wealth distribution, social inequalities, the quality of goods and services, non-commercial transactions or even outcomes not recorded by the market."
"This means that, in many situations, GDP can increase while the majority of a country's citizens become poorer, because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society."
"As such, we are able to consider it acceptable to take into account other indicators that might complement these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete, credible and close to reality as possible."
"GDP has become an indicator of social development and progress generally."
"It is not, however, a measure of environmental sustainability or social inclusion."
"With regard to the need to improve this data and the indicators, the Commission has released a communication entitled 'GDP and beyond: Measuring progress in a changing world'."
"In this communication, it proposes, for example, creating comprehensive indicators which would provide a more reliable knowledge base."
"I believe it is necessary to create an instrument that can supplement GDP, taking account of the fact that it must have a practical application, use clearly defined indicators and rely on high-quality data."
"The Commission's objective of going beyond gross domestic product and finding another measuring system (which would still incorporate GDP) is rightly criticised in the parliamentary report, which emphasises the fact that if the Commission has not yet clearly defined the changeover or accurate indicators, the debate will have to be postponed."
"I therefore voted in favour of the motion."
"Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity and is used in political analysis and discussions worldwide to indicate social development."
"Unfortunately, despite being widely used, there is a growing awareness that the economic and social fabric in Europe has profoundly changed."
"Nowadays, in addition to information about income and wealth, other indicators of an environmental nature influence the quality of life in a country and can no longer be ignored."
"This is why I support the report by Mrs Rosbach, which draws up new indicators taking account of major strands of environmental policy such as energy use, biodiversity, water use and waste generation."
"The challenge lies in integrating existing indices with other elements that are politically relevant and empirically measurable, and which provide reliable statistics on the future development of countries."
"In this sense, I believe that by eliminating subjective factors such as personal happiness, which cannot be considered to be indicators, the new text has reached a good compromise."
"Finally, I hope that both Eurostat and the Eurobarometer will play a major role in this innovative process. Thank you for your attention."
"I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world."
"However, GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general."
"Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost."
"We need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress."
"I feel that we need to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion, as well as indicators that reflect the household level more accurately: income, consumption and wealth."
"There is also a need to measure quality of life in societies, because in order to ensure and sustain quality of life, it is necessary to take into account important, consensual factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing, environmental conditions, etc. Indicators which measure such factors should be assigned a greater role."
"The further development of qualitative and quantitative metrics should be based on the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) indicators, covering the core areas of quality of life."
"I share the rapporteur's analysis in the report voted on today."
"Gross domestic product no longer seems able to meet growing economic and political requirements."
"I think it is necessary to find a complementary system which could contribute to improved policy analysis and debate through the use of clear supplementary indicators for measuring medium- and long-term economic and social progress."
"This will certainly not be an easy task, given the delicate nature of the matter and the potential impacts of decisions taken in this context."
"The challenge we are preparing to embrace therefore lies in finding reliable indicators that are theoretically consistent, politically relevant and empirically measurable."
"GDP is the most effective instrument for measuring macro-economic activity, while also serving as an indirect indicator of social development and progress."
"However, it cannot provide information about all the areas which are the subject of political debates, such as the environment and social inclusion."
"This indicator underpins many of the European Union's policy decisions and instruments."
"I think that we need to step up our efforts to provide indicators which will meet the needs of all citizens."
"They specifically need to measure in a sustainable manner the progress made in achieving economic, social and environmental objectives."
"In conclusion, future European policies need to be based on complete, up-to-date data, covering all the vital aspects."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which stresses that GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world; emphasises that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general; underlines furthermore that it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost; notes that besides measuring economic development and productivity, there are other indicators that influence and explain the living standards in a country and that have not been quantified until now, although relevant indicators exist; stresses the need to develop additional indicators for measuring the full impact of economic activity."
"Nowadays, gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient, appropriate indicator for measuring progress, and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base in an ever changing world."
"There is often a lack of clearly defined information, data and indicators."
"At European and Member State level, there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps highlighted."
"Although it is difficult to develop a method that is coherent at the same time, we believe that what is required is a comprehensive concept, taking account of existing measures, which can be implemented in practice."
"It is important to develop a new tool that can complement GDP, that has practical use, that is based on clearly defined indicators, and that relies on data of a high quality."
"We agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary to submit a tiered strategy that should show how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political work."
"I voted for the report on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world, by Mrs Rosbach, because I believe that gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient, appropriate indicator for measuring progress in a changing world, and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base."
"It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability for example."
"It is necessary to develop other indicators that will help explain which factors influence the living standards in a country."
"I am therefore in favour of the creation of additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term social and economic progress, for example, indicators that take account of climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion."
"The development of these new indicators will help to understand and measure the quality of life in societies."
"Therefore, the development of a Member State or region cannot be assessed solely by an economic indicator such as GDP: quality of life, which is determined by factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing and climate and environmental conditions, must also be taken into account."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for this report, I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, interlinked factors such as health, education, culture, jobs, housing and environmental conditions."
"I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important, and that more importance should be attached to them."
"I voted in favour because this report is a step, albeit a hesitant one, towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance, and, by association, of the progress of societies."
"We all agree that there is a need to improve data and indicators to complement gross domestic product (GDP) for overall societal development."
"The 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' initiative is a complementary instrument capable of contributing to improving analysis and political debate."
"GDP is an indicator of market economic activity that has become the standard point of reference at the service of the world's decision makers."
"GDP is a measure of production that does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general."
"I therefore agree that in the future, other types of instruments should be studied that allow for a greater number of reliable data for measuring a world that is changing."
"in writing. - It is known that GDP (gross domestic product) is the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities."
"GDP is the expression of a production/consumption-based society and does not take into account changes and assets in important fields."
"Taking into account the need for improved data and indicators to complement GDP, various measures are suggested that would provide a more reliable knowledge base."
"The need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term economic and social progress is highly urgent."
"I voted in favour."
"Today, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on GDP and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world."
"Gross domestic product is a widely used index for measuring social development and economic progress."
"However, its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into account a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country."
"There are also some significant parameters which are interpreted incorrectly."
"The Commission has suggested that it is essential to develop an indicator which clearly depicts the situation in the country in question, and which also reflects the situation of households and individuals, as well as how efficiently the country's resources are exploited and the state of the environment."
"The Commission expects greater involvement from the Member States in terms of systematising research into the quality of public life, which would make it possible for clear comparisons to be made between countries."
"A coherent policy would result in it being easier to analyse research, and also in it being possible to predict the potential long-term development of countries."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on GDP and other indicators aimed at measuring progress and the general development of society."
"GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world."
"However, this indicator is not holistic."
"It does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress."
"Moreover, in certain cases, GDP may provide inaccurate and misleading information."
"Consequently, we must make every effort to develop additional medium and long-term indicators for measuring the factors mentioned and the household level."
"I welcome the proposal that when measuring quality of life for society, much attention should be paid to health, education, culture, employment, housing and other similar factors, relating to the core areas of quality of life."
"Thus, we must find means of developing an appropriate and effective tool to complement GDP, which could be applied in a practical way, using clearly defined indicators and relying on high-quality data."
"'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' is a report that aims to assess levels of progress in the European Union through gross domestic product, which has taken on the role of a comprehensive indicator for societal and economic development."
"Unfortunately, however, it no longer provides a reliable basis for policy debate because it does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration."
"There is increasing awareness of the need for improved data and indicators to complement progress assessment criteria."
"For this reason, I voted for a text that tries to integrate development in the European Union with new social indicators, seeks a clearly defined measurement system that goes beyond GDP, and complements it in the context of decision making."
"I voted for this report entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world'."
"As the report rightly says, gross domestic product (GDP), which is used by political decision makers worldwide and referred to in public debates, has also come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general."
"However, it does not provide a reliable basis for policy debate on every issue."
"For example, GDP does not measure environmental sustainability or social integration."
"In the Commission communication on 'GDP and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world', various measures are suggested as suitable ways to complement GDP."
"In particular, it focuses on developing more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base."
"I would express my support for the Commission's intention to adopt a clearly defined measuring system that would go beyond GDP, in the sense that it complements GDP in the context of decision making and assessment, using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators."
"Gross domestic product is the best known measure worldwide."
"It has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general, but does not take into account or measure environmental sustainability or social integration."
"There is a need for improved data and indicators to complement GDP, or else it will not provide a reliable basis for policy debate."
"This issue has already been discussed in prior years and particularly in 2007, when the European Parliament and the Commission, together with various bodies and associations, held a conference entitled 'Beyond GDP'."
"At this conference, the Commission considered that GDP is not a suitable long-term measurement system, just as economic and social progress are not sufficient to assess issues such as climate change, resource efficiency or personal well-being."
"New indicators were subsequently proposed for measuring progress in the achievement of social, economic and environmental objectives."
"For the above reasons, and in order to be able to develop a clear and comprehensive set of indicators that are, at the same time, consistent, relevant and objectively measurable, I voted for the motion being discussed."
"The Commission Communication 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' focuses on developing more comprehensive indicators to complement GDP, which will provide a more reliable knowledge base."
"GDP has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for measuring society's overall development and progress, but it does not provide a reliable basis for policy debate on every issue."
"In particular, GDP does not measure the level of environmental sustainability or social integration."
"I voted for this report because it is important that we develop a tool which can complement GDP, taking into account that it has to be done in a way so that it can have practical use, based on clearly defined indicators and high-quality data."
"This report calls on the Commission to submit a tiered strategy for the 'Beyond GDP' approach which should explain how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political activities."
"I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, interlinked factors such as health, education, culture, jobs, housing and environmental condition."
"I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important, and that more importance should be attached to them."
"I voted in favour because this report is a step, albeit a hesitant one, towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance, and, by association, of societies' progress."
"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard macro-economic indicator, used, as a rule, to measure the economies of various states."
"Nevertheless, it is merely an indicator of wealth, with less potential for comparing social development."
"The success of GDP is due, to a large extent, to its simplicity at the cost, therefore, of the completeness of the results attained."
"It would be useful, therefore, to develop new indicators that enable other aspects of the reality to be sounded out, in order to obtain a better overall view of countries' development."
"It is a complex process which should involve professionals from all areas, in order to obtain a broader and more complete indicator."
"I support this."
"As my colleague, Mrs Bélier, has said, although this report could have gone further with the ambitions and guidelines that it could have set, it does represent a first step and a strong signal sent out to the Council and the Commission for Europe to press ahead with an overhaul of the wealth and development indicators so as to make them more representative of the environmental and social realities and constraints with which we are confronted."
"With this decision, MEPs recognise the need to go beyond and abandon an outdated model, which brings about social inequality and destroys the natural heritage, in order to start a new economic model on a European level."
"It paves the way for the recognition of new indicators that are fairer and that will allow us to undertake the ecological and social transition of our societies."
"This report proposes the adoption of a clearly defined measuring system that would complement gross domestic product as an indicator of overall social development."
"The complementary tool should have practical use and be based on clearly defined indicators and reliable data."
"Only in this way can GDP make a sufficient contribution to policy debate and decision making."
"The Commission is therefore invited to present a comprehensive, tiered strategy that should show how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political work."
"The report on the Commission communication of 20 August 2009 on 'GDP and Beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' highlights the importance of gross domestic product as a comprehensive indicator of social development and economic growth."
"The objective is to adopt a new clearly defined and quantifiable measuring system based on reliable, accurate data, but the Commission's communication does not indicate the tiered strategy for delivering it."
"I voted in favour of the report as I believe it is important to carry out socio-economic analyses using appropriate tools that will complement GDP."
"in writing. - I support this report, which recommends several concrete actions, including the creation of an environmental index, more timely publication of environmental and social data, more accurate reporting on social disparities and extending the system of national accounts to include environmental and social issues."
"In the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' (COM(2009) 433 final), it is acknowledged that 'GDP has also come to be regarded as a proxy indicator for overall societal development and progress in general' but 'does not measure environmental sustainability or social inclusion'."
"In a world in which people's quality of life is increasingly measured using other, non-economic factors, various international institutions, like the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are currently studying the definition of new indicators, so as to measure and analyse economic and social progress."
"As such, I voted for this report, as I believe it is important for the European Union to implement a systematic approach in order to measure social welfare in all its aspects, giving particular emphasis to economic and environmental factors, and to improving quality of life in the medium and long term."
"I believe that the aforementioned indicators will take on a strategic importance in the definition of future cohesion policy, thereby contributing to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the principles enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I voted in favour of the report on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world, for the following reasons."
"Everyone knows that GDP is an indicator used to measure macro-economic activity and cannot be used to measure other things."
"Consequently, new indicators need to be developed, which is precisely what Mrs Rosbach's report does."
"I consider that GDP is a limited indicator and that indicators should be developed to supplement it."
"The report addresses the above issues, which I consider to be very important and in need of immediate resolution, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report."
"I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country's progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done."
"The report in question has had a long and difficult journey, and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way."
"Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education, health and personal activities, but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters, delegating the task of defining them to the Commission."
"Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance."
"If we cast a glance at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) GDP scale (the EU is in first place, Lithuania is 82nd), we can see that GDP does not tell the entire story."
"GDP does not sufficiently reflect the complex socio-economic reality of national and regional challenges."
"Although GDP is a strong macro-economic indicator, it does not reflect Lithuania's greatest social problems, such as unemployment, the quality of education and health care systems and disparities in income distribution."
"In Lithuania, and at EU level, there is often a lack of clear information, data and indicators, and I therefore support the rapporteur's proposal to provide a better report on social indicators."
"I hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policies."
"Nowadays, unfortunately, politicians often do not have such information."
"The development of EU policies should not be purely based on abstract statistics."
"Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans."
"The 'Beyond GDP' method mentioned in this report may prove very useful."
"However, before implementing it, we should find out more about the possibilities of adapting the new method in everyday life."
"I am voting for this report because it is a thorough evaluation of the process and implementation to date and because it launches a debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing of the decision to create global navigation satellite systems and other autonomous European systems."
"This includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will guarantee that the governance model is put into practice."
"The Galileo programme (satellite navigation) is extremely important as it enables the European Union to be competent in cutting-edge technologies."
"Unfortunately, Galileo is facing additional delays and costs."
"Faced with this situation, it is essential that we consider new solutions."
"This is why I supported Mr Remek's report, which is aimed at looking into all the possible sources of funding on top of the contribution from the European budget."
"Galileo, together with EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, an augmentation system that improves the accuracy and the reliability of the US Global Positioning System (GPS) information), is the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) developed by the EU."
"When completed, it is expected to consist of 27 satellites plus a suitable number of spare satellites in orbit at an altitude of approximately 23 000 km above the surface of the earth, and a worldwide network of approximately 40 ground stations."
"The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly, Europe's independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market, which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US."
"I agree that there should be a broad and comprehensive debate at political level about the desired level of ambition (deciding the level of services provided) and the financial resources available (whereby a political choice would need to be made between a purely EU funded programme and one allowing national or private contributions)."
"The result of this debate will impact the policy options for the future governance and management of the GNSS systems."
"The project to implement a European satellite navigation programme is a major challenge and undoubtedly useful for the future of technology in Europe, but the forecasts of expenditure and investment by the European bodies for this project are still not clear or transparent at present."
"Further expenditure is expected in a few years' time, in addition to that initially planned by the programme, and I believe it is likely that additional sums will be needed to complete the project."
"I therefore abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report."
"in writing. - (FR) It is with satisfaction that I voted in favour of this report, which is the culmination of a far-reaching political decision, particularly regarding the implementation of Galileo."
"It is absolutely crucial that the European autonomous satellite radionavigation system be commissioned as soon as possible and, as the report highlights, with long-term funding guarantees."
"Competition from the United States (with the Global Positioning System - GPS) requires us to introduce Galileo quickly, bearing in mind what is at stake economically, technically, politically and strategically."
"The European Union has set itself the objective of becoming the world leader in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Galileo programmes, thus ensuring its technological independence from American GPS."
"Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes, I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018, thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system."
"in writing. - At a time when the Commission, and indeed this Parliament, ought to be searching for, and bringing forward, proposals on how to save money, we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Let us not forget that this is against a backdrop where the Galileo satellite project started off with a budget of EUR 7.7 billion and is now projected to cost EUR 22.6 billion."
"To such a proposal, I categorically say no."
"Current budget lines already in place for this project are easily sufficient to bring about its completion, yet - true to form - the suggestion is to spend even more."
"I know that if I speak to my constituents, they will give little support to the current spending on Galileo, let alone an increase."
"Again, I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents."
"European satellite navigation systems have been causing delays and additional costs, which should lead those responsible to give thought to the patterns currently being followed for their implementation."
"At a time when countries like Portugal are resorting to aid from the other Member States, and when Europe is, as such, facing a serious economic and financial crisis that threatens its stability, an even greater effort should be made to avoid cost overruns and excessive expense."
"I am not questioning the strategic importance of these projects, but I cannot fail to highlight that they have been falling short of expectations."
"I agree that, as both Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) are European programmes and are in the common public interest of the Union, they should, overall, be financed through the EU budget, but I think that other possible sources should be weighed up, including innovative forms of financing."
"This report, drafted by Mr Remek, deals with European satellite navigation programmes."
"It is a report whose purpose is a mid-term review of these programmes, including assessment of their implementation, future challenges and financial perspectives."
"Since 2000, when the Global Positioning System (GPS) service was made available, this sector has grown exponentially (EUR 124 billion in 2008), with the domestic market forecast to be worth EUR 230 billion overall in 2025."
"In 2008, the EU decided to create its own satellite navigation system (Regulation (EC) No 683/2008), Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), with the objective of ensuring Europe's independence and autonomy, raising its market share and putting the industry in a position to be competitive in a strategic and fast-growing market."
"I voted in favour of the rapporteur's proposals, in spite of the cost overruns recorded in the implementation of the project, because I understand that the EU should be at the forefront of researching and developing cutting-edge technology, especially when that same technology represents a scientific and economic asset to the EU."
"As we have said regarding the application of a global European satellite navigation system for transport, the use of this technology could represent an important contribution to the development, modernisation and diversification of public services, in the creation of opportunities for cooperation, and progress in science and its applications, and in the exchange and accessibility of information, with the guarantee of respect for the public's rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"The issue at stake, however, is not that of the existence of a global navigation satellite system for Europe based on use for non-military ends and not integrated into the EU's security arrangements."
"The problem is its potential use for military and aggressive ends."
"In particular, the fact that this satellite navigation system being set up in competition with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States, on which the EU depends, and which is well known to be under military control, with financing from US federal military programmes, is worrying."
"We are therefore reaffirming our doubts about the limits to the potential uses of these programmes in a context of assumed EU-US competition regarding the functionalities and efficiencies of these systems."
"The issue at stake is not that of the existence of a global navigation satellite system for Europe based on use for non-military ends and not integrated into the EU's security arrangements."
"The problem is its potential use for military and aggressive ends."
"Its use for non-military ends could represent an important contribution to the provision of public services, with opportunities for cooperation, and progress in science and its applications, and in the exchange and accessibility of information, with the guarantee of respect for the public's rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"However, the fact that this satellite navigation system has been set up in competition with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States, on which the EU depends, and which is well known to be under military control, with financing from US federal military programmes, is worrying."
"As such, we still have serious doubts about the limits to the potential uses of these programmes in a context of competition, both between functionalities and efficiencies of these systems, and between the EU and US."
"The European Union has taken the important step of introducing, through its political decision based on Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, an autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), owned and operated by the Union."
"The Commission should produce a comprehensive analysis aimed at securing a more precise description of possible scenarios and resources in terms of operation and use after 2013."
"It will include all commercial aspects of use, such as the legal, contractual and financial structures of the various models of usage, ensuring the establishment of a stable model of administration."
"in writing. - Galileo, Europe's own global navigation satellite system, is of great importance to Europe and, in particular, the UK."
"This project, which I fully support, has not only received significant public funding but private industry throughout the EU is also investing money, time and expertise into developing this system."
"However, despite recognising the need to push forward with this, I felt the need to abstain on the final vote."
"Mr Remek's report suggests completing the Galileo system will require additional funding of up to EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."
"In this current difficult financial climate, I have to oppose this increase in spending, especially considering that the programme is already 60% over budget."
"I believe that Galileo must stay within its current budget."
"Let us look at how we can improve the current system within the means that we have."
"I would strongly urge the Commission to take robust action to improve its programme management and to achieve savings."
"In order to do so, the Commission must undertake a thorough and comprehensive impact assessment, so that we can make an informed decision regarding the future funding of the programme."
"I welcomed this document because this report is a response to the Commission's Communication on the mid-term review of the autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Galileo and EGNOS), which assesses the process and implementation so far and launches the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing."
"The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons: firstly, Europe's independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market, which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US."
"Indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year (including the downstream and upstream market and public benefits)."
"GNSS is seen as a disruptive technology, with high potential to create innovations, build up a high-tech knowledge base and increase productivity in many sectors."
"Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10%."
"The Commission should launch a comprehensive analysis to identify more precisely the possible scenarios and means of operation and exploitation post 2013."
"This includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put in place."
"The EGNOS and Galileo systems, when they are completed, will increase security in transport, using certain applications."
"These applications also represent the growing global markets from which the EU will benefit financially."
"The development of these systems will make an essential contribution to the development of European aviation transport and to a more economical and efficient system of rail and road transport."
"A problem for the development of these applications and for completing the systems on time may be a lack of investment."
"It is important to see the benefit to the Member States of investment and of developing the systems so that they are completed on schedule."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's report because the project under examination meets many expectations of those looking to developments in research and technology with optimism."
"EGNOS and Galileo are projects that will generate approximately EUR 60 billion of indirect benefits to the European Union economy and society, in the form of enhanced road and aviation security, reduced air pollution and pesticide consumption, new jobs and public safety, generating very significant value for money."
"Therefore, before a decision is made on a further financial commitment from the EU budget in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, a clear assessment of all the possible technical options and related costs and benefits needs to be presented by the Commission."
"Ten years ago, the European Union launched two satellite navigation programmes: Galileo and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)."
"The first will be operational in 2014 and will be accurate to within less than a metre, whereas GPS is accurate to within several metres."
"This technological progress will enable European companies to innovate and position themselves at the cutting edge of services made possible by global positioning."
"However, there is also a strategic dimension to Galileo."
"At present, Europe is dependent on the GPS system, which is American."
"When Galileo is in place, the Union will enjoy total independence as well as superiority in this area, and it is plain to see the importance of the applications."
"The civilian and military resources of the Member States will be much more effective as a result."
"I voted for this resolution which, while praising the technical success, reminds the European Commission of the points where the programme can be improved: funding, public awareness, and involving our international partners."
"in writing. - The main challenge for the international activities of the GNSS Programmes will be to ensure the compatibility and interoperability with Galileo, to access global GNSS-related resources and set worldwide standards, to ensure security of the space segment and network of ground stations, while ensuring a stricter control of sensitive GNSS technologies developed with European funding, and to join in an international effort to develop innovative applications and specialised applications of supra-regional interest."
"An important objective will be to create market opportunities for the European GNSS technology and applications industries."
"We believe that the EU's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), consisting of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes, is an important step for Europe, firstly, as it ensures its autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and, secondly, as it enables it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market."
"It is very important, however, that continuity of service is guaranteed, as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society, without other independent GNSS systems in place."
"Nevertheless, to fully exploit its advantages, Galileo needs to reach full operating capacity, and to do so will require additional investment."
"Currently, the financial picture is anything but positive."
"On this point, we think that a broad and comprehensive political debate should take place about the desired level of ambition and the financial resources available."
"Finally, we maintain that it is important to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013, which includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put into place."
"The European satellite navigation programmes, Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), will enable Europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs, which is very important, and will contribute to improving the lives of the European public, as well as bringing direct and indirect benefits to the European economy."
"However, the problems financing these programmes could cause significant delays in their implementation, along with the inherent damage."
"We have to implement a medium- to long-term financing strategy in order for it to be possible to create the necessary market confidence and, consequently, to attract investment and the purchase of applications and services."
"Only a fully functional Galileo and EGNOS system will be an asset to the EU, in all its policies, not least in transport, in agriculture, in the fight against climate change, in the prevention of natural and man-made disasters, and in the area of science, technology and innovation."
"The European Parliament has always supported the European Union's Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), implemented by means of the Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programmes."
"Unfortunately, today, the European Union is dependent on the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States."
"Nonetheless, Galileo offers clear advantages over the GPS system."
"Furthermore, EGNOS is used on a daily basis by 80 000 European farmers and has recently been certified for civil aviation, and should shortly be certified for maritime transport."
"Space policy and the GNSS programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses."
"From this point of view, the Commission must ensure the compatibility and interoperability of Galileo with other satellite navigation systems."
"Finally, it is important that these European programmes receive the funding they need to be brought to fruition."
"in writing. - The EU took an important step with its political decision."
"The report is a mid-term review of this flagship initiative, assessing the process and implementation so far and launching the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing in the EU system."
"In my view, it is necessary to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013."
"I fully support the report of Vladimir Remek and I voted in favour."
"The GNSS (Galileo and EGNOS) satellite navigation system project, like the Schengen Information System II project, has turned into a bottomless money pit."
"The follow-up costs still seem impossible to estimate in concrete terms; all that is clear is that savings are necessary if we are to prevent a final explosion in the already mushrooming project costs."
"However, problems arise here when the associated cuts in services only affect the citizens of Europe as taxpayers, only leaving services for military use untouched."
"Further discussions relating to the previous procedure and implementation and its future administration, use and funding are required in this context."
"It certainly seems unlikely that an increased use of private enterprise in this area will bring any financial relief."
"The Commission's evaluation is certainly awaited with anticipation."
"The Galileo idea is a good one in principle; however, the costs must be brought under control."
"I took this into consideration when voting."
"Once again (as in the case of the ITER project), the EU has managed to delay a project for so long that the costs are impossible to estimate."
"This is equally true for the follow-up costs for the GNSS (Galileo and EGNOS satellite navigation systems) and Schengen Information System II projects."
"It is not just follow-up costs that have exploded: 'normal' project costs have also reached massive proportions."
"An attempt is now being made to limit damage by making savings."
"These are necessary moves."
"Unfortunately, it seems as if these cuts will only affect the European taxpayer as they will result in reductions in services."
"Although GNSS will only have a military application, it will be the taxpayers who foot the bill - twice over now as a result of the follow-up costs."
"This situation casts a pall over the GNSS project, which is otherwise something to be welcomed."
"For that reason, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of the report on the mid-term review of the Galileo programme."
"The ambitious European endeavour to develop a European satellite navigation system, based on a constellation of 30 satellites and offering quality global positioning services, guarantees Europe's autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and a share in the important global high-tech market, on which the USA and Japan are currently top of the league."
"Moreover, Galileo will have the facility to support the implementation of previous traffic management systems for all means of transport (road, air, sea, etc.), which will improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact."
"In the agricultural sector, Galileo will be able to support improvements to agricultural output by guaranteeing more efficient use of land and water, thereby reducing the need for fertilisers and pesticides."
"However, the questions raised and my previous question to the Commission about the very high cost of this particular endeavour have remained unanswered."
"To be precise, the cost of implementing the programme was initially estimated at EUR 3 330 million (of which 1 800 million was to be paid by the public sector)."
"This was increased to EUR 5 580 million, all of which is to be paid by the public sector at a very difficult time for the economy."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The EU has taken an important step with the adoption of its policy decision, recorded in Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, on the creation of autonomous European global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) - Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) - under the ownership and management of the EU."
"The communication considered in this report constitutes a mid-term review of this emblematic initiative in which there is an assessment of the process and its implementation to date, with a debate launched on its future governance, use and financing."
"In the current economic context, there is a pressing need to conduct a wide-ranging political debate about the desired level of ambition, which will determine the level of service provided, and on the resources available, during which it will be necessary to make a political choice between a model whereby it is exclusively funded by the EU and one whereby national or private contributions may be permitted."
"The result of this debate will be reflected in the political choices regarding future governance and management systems for GNSSs."
"The Galileo system will improve the accuracy and the reliability of US Global Positioning System (GPS) information."
"This new system will be important for ensuring Europe's autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems and enabling it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market."
"As we know, the programme is funded fully by the Union budget with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion until 2014."
"We know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around EUR 60 billion per year, but the Commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity."
"As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project's future costs."
"The Galileo programme, which, in conjunction with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), aims to create a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), is in line with a strategic choice on the part of the Union: it confirms its entry onto the global market, while its efforts assert itself in the global market, which is currently dominated by the United States, and is important to boosting the European economy itself."
"Let us remember that, as is said in the report, 7% of EU gross domestic product (GDP) depends on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), reinforcing the need for an autonomous satellite navigation system."
"The intention at the moment is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the project."
"Among the conclusions to draw from it, it should be stressed that the running costs of these programmes are estimated to be some EUR 800 million per annum and that revenue will only reach EUR 80 million per annum by around 2030."
"Nevertheless, it is estimated, on the other hand, that the indirect benefits could be worth as much as EUR 60 billion per annum."
"In this context, I think it is important, as the rapporteur suggests, to launch the debate about the structure of this programme and how to make money out of it in future, so as to adopt robust and safe solutions for the future of Europe."
"I fully support the autonomous European global navigation satellite system, and I agree with the adoption of all the measures essential to securing its full operational capacity."
"This view prevails across the groups of the European Parliament, as is borne out by the fact that no amendments have been submitted for the report."
"In the report of Mr Remek, we call on the European Commission to move towards a solution to the problems that have arisen and to ensure a funding procedure for the programme such that it can achieve full operational capacity in 2018."
"In the interests of retaining the EU's competitive advantage, the launch must not be delayed, otherwise other countries such as China, India and Japan will outstrip us."
"in writing. - This has been a disastrous vote for the Greens."
"We voted against the two separate votes (paragraphs 19 and 20), and both were adopted; we voted against at the final vote, but the text was adopted."
"Our concerns are mainly about the speed with which some wish to pursue this, despite the numerous questions we still have."
"I voted for this report because I agree on the importance of the Galileo project, as part of a European global navigation satellite system."
"It will ensure the European Union's autonomy and independence from other global navigation systems, and enable it to claim a share of this booming worldwide high-tech market."
"Given that our competitors are getting stronger and advancing dynamically, and that to fully exploit its advantages, Galileo needs to reach full operation capacity, the project would require additional investment, as indicated by the rapporteur."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which asks for the Commission to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013."
"This includes all commercial aspects of exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put into place."
"The report was adopted in committee by an overwhelming majority (44 to 4)."
"The European initiative to create the Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programmes will not only enable Europe to establish autonomy and strategic independence from other economic blocs, but, above all, will also bring improvements to the daily lives of Europeans, and will generate direct and indirect benefits for the European economy."
"However, in order for the programme's real benefits to be achieved, there is a need to establish a medium- and long-term strategy for financing and governance, covering the main actions to be carried out."
"That is the only way it will be possible to create the necessary market confidence and, consequently, to secure investment as well as the purchase of applications and services."
"Only if they become fully functional will the Galileo and EGNOS systems provide concrete benefit for all European Union policies, specifically, in transport, in agriculture, in the fight against climate change, in the prevention of natural and human disasters, and in the area of science, technology and innovation."
"To increase support for these projects, it is crucial to increase communication between those in charge of them and the general public, in order to create a direct relationship between these initiatives and European citizens."
"Further to that, I believe it is necessary to create an appropriate financial structure so it can be realised and then applied."
"in writing. - This report looks at the progress that has been made towards a European global satellite navigation system, or Galileo, and looks at issues regarding the future governance of the initiative."
"When fully operational, Galileo will be a rival to American GPS, and will operate on a wider and more accurate system of satellites and ground stations across the world."
"Although there has been substantial technical progress, the report is more critical of the financial situation regarding the project."
"It raises issues that need to be addressed and recommends courses of action that can ensure that the satellite system reaches Full Operational Capacity (FOC) as soon as possible, meaning a quicker return on the investment, and this report serves as the basis for the debate on how the Commission can best achieve this."
"I am voting for this report in that it presents suitable political priorities for Parliament for the Multiannual Financial Framework, in both legislative and budgetary terms."
"Some priorities included by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament which I would highlight are, for example: 1) investment for jobs and growth; 2) the social aspect, and the workers' rights and conditions; 3) sustainability; 4) European added value; 5) proposed structure and duration."
"I note the need to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, to regions with serious and permanent natural or demographic limitations, such as the most northerly regions with very low population density and islands, and to cross-border and mountain regions; this is because the resources and capabilities of these regions can play a significant role in the future competitiveness of the European Union."
"in writing. - I voted against the Garriga Polledo report from the SURE committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for the period 2014-2020 by 5%."
"I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations."
"I introduced an amendment to reduce the budget by 2.8%, which is the average rate of irregularities affecting the EU budget as reported by the European Court of Auditors."
"Among the amendments and innovations I opposed was an amendment to create an informal and powerless monitoring group in the European Parliament to scrutinise programmes."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this important resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe."
"I support the rapporteur that with the rejection of the option of freezing the resources, as proposed by five Heads of Government in December 2010 (France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland), the European Parliament is sending a strong political signal for the negotiations between the 27 Member States, due to start after the official presentation of the European Commission proposal expected on 29 June."
"It is important to note that unanimity between the Member States and the assent of the European Parliament are needed to take the final decision, not expected until at least June 2012."
"We, Members of the European Parliament, demand at least an increase of the level of resources of 5% compared to the 2013 budget."
"It is also important to note that the European Parliament proposes to introduce a new structure for the financial framework under a single 'Europe 2020' heading and asks for a 5, or 5+5 year-long framework as of 2021."
"After around a year's work, the special committee on policy challenges and budgetary resources has finally presented the future decisions determining priorities in expenditure for the efficient and effective use of European Union appropriations leading to the implementation of result-oriented policies."
"Bearing in mind that the European Union budget is primarily an investment budget, which can generate more investment from public or private sources, it must be possible to adjust it adequately to changing needs and circumstances."
"The decision to increase the resources of the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% will guarantee the stability of existing programming cycles and new investment in areas such as European energy and transport networks, which will allow Europe to defend its competitiveness and prepare the ground for long-term economic growth."
"These sectors also appear in the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth through knowledge, innovation and the promotion of social and territorial cohesion."
"in writing. - The report on a New Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe is a valuable piece of collective analysis on the future configurations of the EU budget."
"It estimates the financial resources needed for the Union to attain its objectives and carry out its policies for the period starting 1 January 2014."
"Its essential point is a request for an increase of at least 5% in the total EU budget for 2013, and the request for the introduction of an autonomous source of funding."
"The report stresses very clearly that without sufficient additional resources in the post-2013 MFF, the Union will not be able to fulfil the existing policy priorities, linked, in particular, to the Europe 2020 strategy, or the new tasks provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, let alone respond to unforeseen events."
"I voted in favour of this report also because it calls for a more transparent, simpler and fairer financing system for the European Union."
"I voted in favour of this excellent report by my colleague, Mr Garriga Polledo, as it provides an extremely good presentation of the budget that the European Union will need after 2013 to respond to the political challenges it will face."
"If Europe really intends to implement the policies laid down in the European Treaties, including the most recent policies, it must have the financial resources it needs to fulfil these ambitions."
"Therefore, I voted for the collection of 'own resources' and the creation of a 'tax on financial transactions' to fund the European Union's budget."
"This necessary increase in the European budget must be accompanied by substantial savings through optimising (pooled) expenditure."
"Furthermore, the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is essential for the food security and independence of our continent, and EU regional policy, strengthened by creating an intermediate category of regions to enable additional financial support to be channelled to those regions where per capita GDP is between 75% and 90% of the European average, such as Auvergne and Limousin, find within it all the space that they deserve."
"This report is therefore of inestimable support to citizens!"
"The European farming sector is of socio-economic importance, particularly in terms of ensuring the security of food supply and in terms of promoting rural communities and the environment."
"So, the CAP must have a strong budget and proper resources so as to be able to meet those goals."
"I fully support what is in the report on the broad aims and tasks of the CAP and that there be no cuts in CAP funding for 2013, so that it would be able to properly meet those broad needs."
"Much is expected of the next Multiannual Financial Framework in terms of achieving the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, encouraging research and innovation, combating the challenges facing the environment, achieving the aims of the European Social, Cohesion and Regional Funds, and fostering education, mobility, training and lifelong learning."
"The EU must have adequate resources and a strong Multiannual Financial Framework if it is to achieve those goals and meet the needs of the people of the Union."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union faces enormous challenges, and will require significant financial resources to overcome these."
"It is clear that the EU budget's current resource system will be incapable of ensuring the implementation of all the commitments made."
"I agree that it is necessary to fundamentally review budgeting principles, so that, in future, funds for the EU budget are collected from own resources."
"We also urgently need to consider innovative financing mechanisms, such as a tax on financial transactions, which would make a significant contribution to financing the EU budget."
"I cannot support the report by Mr Garriga Polledo."
"The reason for this is that I am fundamentally against Member States' contributions being replaced with direct EU funding, for which read an EU tax."
"After all, the Union should be at the service of Member States and that must be visible in the financing arrangements."
"In terms of content, I have problems with the EU 2020 strategy being used as a guideline for the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"The objectives of the strategy concern social and employment policies, which fall within the competence of individual Member States."
"The failed Lisbon strategy shows where we will end up if we base our strategy on matters over which the EU has no say."
"The report also seeks to reduce the amount of arrears by increasing payments."
"If projects are not being implemented smoothly, then the sensible thing to do would be to enter into fewer new contractual commitments."
"In brief, the report shows no trace of understanding of prudent budgetary management, in light of the enormous economic problems facing European economies."
"'Cut your coat according to your cloth' is a better suggestion than this undesirable call for more and new resources."
"In this way, we are repeating, at a European level, the mistakes which several countries have made in recent years."
"The Polledo report focuses attention on the numerous challenges faced by the European Union, but mainly on the need for ordinary citizens to be convinced that European institutions and the European Union are serving their values and interests."
"This is why I support the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework, which will help convince European citizens that the Union has the ability to think and act to protect their long-term interests and achieve effective results in ensuring stable growth and internal cohesion."
"Although there are a few decisions which I do not fully agree with, the report is, on the whole, beneficial to Bulgaria's interests, and I voted to adopt it."
"I voted against Mr Garriga Polledo's report because of some points that I feel are critical in the motion put to the vote."
"Although I support some paragraphs, such as the one regarding the reduction of the European Parliament to one seat, the report hopes that an actual European tax will be introduced to finance European Union activities."
"It discusses funding for Roma communities, a subject that my political party has always opposed, and the allocation of large amounts of funding for a new round of enlargement of the European Union in the direction of the Western Balkans, another point with which I do not agree."
"Finally, European funding has been pledged to help developing countries combat climate change, an issue which, aside from environmental propaganda, will certainly not change the future of the ecosystem."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the European Parliament's contribution to the debate on how money from the EU budget should be distributed in future (2014-2020), and which areas should be financed to help Europe recover following the global crisis, is particularly important."
"Following the debate, the resolution adopted criticised the idea put forward by certain Member States of freezing the EU budget at 2013 levels, given the financial difficulties that many EU countries have faced in recent times."
"Instead, when determining the EU financial perspective 2014-2020, we were urged to continue to guarantee the required financing for areas that stimulate economic growth and successful development."
"These areas include research and fostering innovation, combating unemployment, poverty and exclusion, adequate preparedness for demographic changes, responsible use of natural resources, internal and external security, regional and agricultural policy, and development of energy and transport infrastructure."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which I endorsed."
"Europe must use the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to provide definite answers to the citizens, who have been suffering from the economic crisis for too long now, and to ensure robust long-term growth."
"So far, the European Union has fallen short of the expectations and ambitions it should have."
"We will have to face very complex challenges as well as the economic crisis, demographic decline and energy shortages."
"The response to these challenges will have to be sought in the Europe 2020 strategy, which should be the policy reference of the next MFF."
"We must identify a number of key priorities for the next MFF, such as growth and employment, sustainable development, cohesion for growth and employment, citizenship and Global Europe."
"The next MFF must therefore be designed in such a way as to ensure flexibility in order to avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF."
"In fact, it would be a good idea to plan a mid-term review to allow for the possibility of revising the ceilings."
"Finally, it is crucial to enhance the current system of extra-budgetary instruments for flexibility, simplifying their use and providing them with sufficient envelopes."
"The next MFF should strike the right balance between stability, medium-term predictability and flexibility, a principle which should remain at its core."
"I voted on Wednesday, 8 June for an increase in the 2014-2020 budget."
"As we know, the budget represents the start of any political act."
"If you have no budget, you have no project."
"The EU budget must therefore reflect the EU's growth strategy and its ambitions for its citizens."
"The Member States have suggested freezing the EU budget for two reasons."
"On the one hand, the money comes from contributions by the States and, on the other, a stable budget for the 2014-2020 period means that all the EU's major projects to restore growth and to invest in the future are jeopardised."
"Member States would like to see the EU playing a decisive role when it comes to taking risks but they criticise it when it does so."
"I therefore, like the majority of my fellow Members - with the exception of the Eurosceptics - voted for a 5% increase in the budget to fund future major projects."
"We are now well aware of the fact that States are incapable of resolving on their own the problems caused by globalisation."
"The next step will be to provide the EU with a budget based on 'own resources' in order to curtail our reliance on the 'bad' will of States."
"The EU's powers have increased over the years, especially after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, the budget has grown only very slowly."
"Our ambition is to have a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe."
"If we want to achieve this ambitious goal, I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious."
"This is why I believe that a minimum 5% increase is needed to the budget envisaged for the next MFF."
"The EU also needs to hold an in-depth discussion on the topic of own resources involving both representatives of the European institutions and national parliaments, so as to reach a consensus on an own resources system which will ensure the effective implementation of European policies."
"I support the idea expressed in this report about the need to channel the resources towards those measures aimed at achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives."
"I also fully concur with the need to ensure coherence and complementarity between the various instruments which currently exist for supporting research, development and innovation."
"Finally, a credible budget must be coherent and guarantee efficient expenditure by avoiding any duplication in the use of funds."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilise all the EU's budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy, and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States."
"While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions, which they would like to see fall, and of its financial returns, which they would like to see increase, this report argues for strong, integrated community policies, both in terms of long-standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - We need to gear the EU budget for the 21st century."
"The budget must match our ambitions."
"New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale."
"Major green investment is needed in areas like renewable infrastructure, with more wind farms in the north and solar energy in the south."
"Irish investment in wind energy will only pay off, for example, if there is European infrastructure to export that energy via the UK and France."
"With oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage, we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient, by using more renewable energy, by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment."
"The long term EU budget should also follow the agreed so-called EU 2020 strategic objectives, especially our internationally binding climate objectives."
"CAP should be reformed to pay farmers for the delivery of public goods, such as an attractive countryside rich in biodiversity."
"We need to maintain the CAP budget to ensure these vital environmental services are provided in Ireland and across Europe."
"in writing. - (NL) The report on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework does not in any way take into account the frustrations of the Member States and of the voters and taxpayers throughout Europe."
"We keep hearing calls for more revenue for the European Union, at the same time as all other levels of administration are having to make cuts."
"Our failure not to take this into account bears witness to our profound arrogance and alienation from the world."
"Europe must cut its coat according to its cloth, confine itself to its core activities and must itself make a number of savings."
"Only in this way will we be able to restore confidence amongst the voters."
"I voted for the report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework because it introduces the option of applying a financial transaction tax at European level."
"This would levy a tax on speculative financial transactions to discourage this kind of practice and would help generate new incomes intended for European Union Member States."
"The European Union, through its funding for research and innovation, and through its support to agriculture but also to regional development, contributes in a very tangible manner to boosting the European economies."
"For this reason, I fully support the proposals adopted today by our Parliament to set the European Union's budget for the next seven years."
"In order to meet citizens' needs, Parliament has proposed to create, in the context of the Structural Funds, a new category of regions where GDP per capita is between 75% and 90% of the Union's GDP."
"These regions will thus receive financial aid according to criteria more suited to their situation."
"I fully support this proposal, which will, for instance, benefit directly people living in my constituency in Languedoc-Roussillon."
"The European Parliament has spoken out again on the European budget through the Multiannual Financial Framework, a kind of EU five-year plan."
"Now the EU, which requires what can be very demanding sacrifices of Member States, in no way provides for the application of this good advice to itself."
"The proposals contained in this text are unrealistic and are nearer to mind-numbing mantras; waste and bureaucracy still have a bright future ahead of them."
"Worse still, in order to escape 'blackmail' by Member States, which are naturally reluctant to increase their already very high contributions, Parliament once more raises the issue of own resources for the EU, or, in short, a European tax."
"'Do as I say and not as I do' could be the new European motto."
"By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as 'intermediate' for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions."
"I have a positive view of the report's focus on the common challenges that Europe is facing."
"It addresses the issues of the climate and the environment as constituting an element of all policy areas, the fight for democracy, peace and freedom at a global level, and the urgent need for research, innovation and infrastructure."
"The Europe 2020 strategy and investment in initiatives with European added value permeated the debates during the work on the report."
"However, I am deeply concerned about the fact that we have given the authority to set priorities to the Council."
"The European Parliament should have had the courage to set priorities."
"Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Europe are included, there is nevertheless no way in the world that we could finance everything all at once from the EU budget."
"I want a realistic and implementable negotiating strategy and this has not been achieved, as no clear priorities have been set in this report."
"I therefore abstained in the final vote."
"At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me."
"Further to this idea, I find countless concerns in the report that deserve to be worked on and studied."
"I consider placing the MFF at the service of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and the concern for at least maintaining the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget and keeping the two-pillar system, to be positive."
"However, I would state, once again, that the call for the introduction of a financial transaction tax has once again appeared in a report which is not directly related to setting out financial policy, and which I do not consider transparent practice."
"I would congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which has resulted in a report enabling us to start drawing up the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period, which constitutes a challenge for the Commission and for the Council."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is consensual, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable."
"It will be the guide for the forthcoming financial perspectives."
"However, the strategy will only be successful if it has budgets corresponding to its actions and objectives."
"In this sense, it is necessary for the MFF's values to match the ambition and commitment that the Europe 2020 strategy constitutes."
"Cohesion policy is a result of the solidarity principle."
"It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it support the poorest regions."
"I consider it essential that funding for cohesion policy be at least maintained at the same levels."
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) has been a success."
"Therefore, the total sums channelled into agriculture should also be kept up and should be distributed more equitably."
"It is important that we move towards an MFF whose revenues are not more than 80% dependent on national budgets."
"There is, therefore, a pressing need to go ahead with the debate on the new own resources."
"The rapporteur has stated that the time has come to put a stop to loudly proclaimed statements of intent that are not properly backed up with the financial resources enabling the announced objectives to be actually achieved."
"This report is a perfect example of this exercise."
"By basically proposing that the EU budget be frozen until the 2020 review, with a residual increase of 5%, many of the objectives that feature in the course of its 40 pages are being compromised, particularly, that of social and economic cohesion."
"In the face of a serious economic and social crisis, exacerbated by EU policy, the budgets made possible by these financial perspectives will thus be rendered incapable of ensuring a redistributive function, which is essential to the effective realisation of the principle of cohesion."
"We have made countless proposals on the need to increase the EU budget to support economic and social cohesion, as well as to reduce the compulsory nature of national contributions, cutting them to a maximum of 10% of the total cost for the project submitted, particularly in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties."
"Furthermore, we have been stressing the importance of promoting investment in public services, of supporting production, of creating jobs with rights, of eradicating poverty, and of combating social inequality."
"The path proposed in this report is something else; something very different."
"That is why we voted against it."
"In spite of the occasional positive point, the report does not recommend a break with and a change from the European Union's policies on its financial resources."
"We therefore voted against."
"It is especially serious that it does not tackle, as an absolute priority, the response to the serious social problems created by the economic and social crisis, with a significant increase in the EU budget for supporting economic and social cohesion, accompanied by a cut in compulsory national contributions, reducing them to a maximum of 10% of the project submitted."
"Above all, in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties, it should commit to investment in public services, to supporting production, to creating jobs with rights, to eradicating poverty, and to combating social inequality and all types of discrimination, not least gender."
"It is also necessary to promote peace, development cooperation and aid, and a significant cut in military spending and overseas representation."
"Lamentably, the report limits itself to proposing a residual increase in current EU budget values of 5%, despite opposing the freezing of the post-2013 EU budget, as advocated by some Member States."
"However, this suggested increase means that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (financial perspectives) 2014-2020 would represent just 1.11% of EU gross national income (GNI), as opposed to 1.06%, the sum projected for 2013."
"In a situation where many Member States are implementing tough fiscal measures, the EU budget needs to be better justified than ever before."
"It must ensure the highest possible level of European added value, it must be sensibly managed and it must support public and private resources as far as possible."
"The structure of the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should be realistic, and it should enable continuity of planning and avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF, especially the lack of flexibility within the areas."
"With regard to the method for developing a system of own resources for the EU, which is gradually being replaced by Member State contributions and is consequently perceived as an excessive burden on the public finances of Member States, the reform of this system is more necessary than at any time in the past."
"In my opinion, a better system ensuring fairness, transparency and sufficient budgetary revenues would make it possible for the budgetary decision-making process to focus more on the key priorities of the Union."
"In particular, the current exemptions and corrective mechanisms should be gradually phased out, which would be an essential step towards greater fairness and transparency in the EU budget."
"in writing. - The EU budget post-2013 must be fit for purpose to maintain competitiveness, to increase economic growth and to combat high unemployment in Europe."
"I believe that agriculture and a strong, well resourced common agricultural policy are central to this objective."
"I fully support the call in the report to link agriculture to the Europe 2020 strategy as I firmly believe that the agriculture and food sector can make a valuable contribution to future economic growth in Ireland and across Europe."
"That is why it is essential that we protect and maintain the some EUR 1.7 billion which Ireland annually receives under the CAP."
"A strongly funded common agricultural policy will protect Europe's food security, contribute to our climate change targets and maintain employment in our rural communities."
"I am pleased that the report recognises the role played by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in maintaining employment in coastal, island and remote regions."
"I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post-2013."
"The peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget."
"I urge all Members to support the retention of these important programmes."
"To be brief, notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text, Parliament calls for the European budget, in its total amount and distribution, to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union, as it defines them."
"It therefore demands for it to be increased - by at least 5% in the first instance."
"How is it to be financed?"
"By a new European tax, of course!"
"Who are they trying to kid?"
"Europe already costs a great deal."
"What has been the result?"
"Powerlessness in the face of the crisis, harm caused by the euro, the trade agreements and the Schengen Agreement, useless posturing, interferences and obstacles in other domains."
"At a time when Member States are being asked to slash their own budgets drastically, when people are being summoned to tighten their belts, when social security systems are being undermined by unemployment and immigration, while those responsible for the crisis continue to line their pockets and markets continue to speculate, it is obscene for this assembly, in cahoots with Brussels, to demand a single cent more to pursue these policies and make them worse."
"With the adoption of the Garriga report on the political and budgetary challenges facing the European Union after 2013, Parliament is anticipating, much too timidly in my view, the debate to come on the future financial prospects of the Union."
"This report reiterates its opposition to pitting against each other the different policies that fall within EU competence and insists on the need to mobilise sufficient funds, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy."
"It sends a clear message to Member States: we intend to support strong integrated policies and to do this by increasing the budget by at least 5%."
"Furthermore, in a context where citizens are subjected to austerity, we must maintain a strong cohesion policy."
"That is what we propose in this report, with support for the plan to create an intermediate category of regions, which will enable a distribution of Structural Funds that is more in accordance with the real economic and social situations of our territories."
"Finally, the Union must grant itself financial resources that match its ambitions."
"We have therefore reiterated our desire to introduce a tax on financial transactions, a project which is widely supported by the public and which would encourage greater support on their part for the European project."
"By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth and development, first and foremost, the Europe 2020 strategy, for which adequate resources are needed."
"It is important, in fact, to remember the added value of the European budget, which can act as a driver for economic growth, research and development and employment, particularly for young people, alongside national budgets."
"The report also reinforces Parliament's position in favour of new financial instruments, such as the tax on financial transactions and Eurobonds, which are an opportunity for the European economy."
"It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament's ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report insofar as it launches an appeal to set up strong, integrated EU policies."
"Two other important points received my support."
"Firstly, the creation of a category of 'intermediate regions' within cohesion policy in order to ensure that the distribution of Structural Funds matches more closely the real economic and social situation of the territories; and secondly, a renewed call for the creation of a tax on financial transactions as a new resource to safeguard European economic policies."
"At a time of austerity policies and when unbounded financial speculation persists, it is fair to require the financial sector to play its part in relaunching an economy that has been battered by its irresponsible behaviour."
"The resolution adopted by the European Parliament is our first contribution to the debate on the future financial perspective."
"I wholeheartedly support the proposal to increase the European Union's budget in the upcoming budgetary perspective."
"I believe that the European Union needs an ambitious budget, which will correspond to the challenges facing us."
"Reducing or freezing the European budget, as proposed by some of the Member States, is not a good solution for the European economy."
"The European budget must be a budget which will support the Member States as they exit the crisis, and which is also able to respond to unexpected events more flexibly."
"I also welcome Parliament's support for the idea of categorising some areas as intermediate regions, in order to ensure that their further development is promoted despite the fact that they exceed the currently binding criterion of 75% of the European Union's GDP."
"Introducing this category will help regions which are still contending with many development challenges even though they have exceeded the EU average and, in the near future, this will include Polish regions."
"I believe that the EU budget must be given sufficient resources to be able to finance the commitments that have been decided upon."
"At the same time, I would like to emphasise that the EU ought to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget."
"I do not believe that the overall size of the budget should increase."
"I would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy, etc. set in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Therefore, I also do not believe that the 2013 budget level for agriculture should be retained, but would welcome the distribution of agricultural aid evenly between the Member States."
"I also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU's administrative expenditure, and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure."
"I do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised, as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling."
"I also see a need for a review of the EU's own resources system."
"The current system is very complicated and lacks transparency."
"The rebates have not made the system any fairer, but instead have given rise to a number of new exemptions and corrections."
"However, a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation, as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union."
"Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force."
"In the vote on the report on the EU's long-term budget in Strasbourg on 8 June 2011, we Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament chose to vote against the proposal."
"This was because the proposal does not set priorities for important and less important expenditure, which we consider to be necessary."
"Instead of showing leadership and focusing on what will bring growth and competitiveness to Europe, the proposal calls for an increase in the budget of 5% so as to avoid the need to prioritise."
"At a time when the EU Member States are fighting massive budget deficits and growing national debt, the European Parliament is choosing to demand more money for the EU."
"This is a line that we cannot support."
"We should instead phase out the subsidies for the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the Structural Funds, but unfortunately, the proposal that was voted through goes in the opposite direction."
"While we voted against the report as a whole, we welcome the wording in the proposal concerning a 'significant increase' in appropriations for science and research."
"This is something that we have worked hard for and its inclusion is a step in the right direction."
"When determining the EU financial perspective 2014-2020, it is necessary to ensure adequate financing for areas that stimulate economic growth and successful development; in other words, to focus on research and fostering innovations, combating unemployment, poverty and exclusion, adequate preparedness for demographic changes, responsible use of natural resources, internal and external security, regional and agricultural policy, and the development of energy and transport infrastructure."
"I abstained from voting on this document because we need to fundamentally review the common agricultural policy, which must guarantee a fair and uniform system of direct payments, and many other important areas, without which we will be unable to create a competitive and strong Europe."
"This report is perhaps one of the most important of this legislature."
"I had the opportunity to be the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education and I believe that the agreement which has been reached, albeit far from perfect, is probably the best we could achieve in the current economic climate."
"I confidently voted for it and hope that it will send a clear message to the Council, which will take into account the European Parliament's position."
"I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework."
"I should particularly like to emphasise the call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments between Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers."
"I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also, so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks."
"The new EU financing system must be more transparent, simpler and fairer."
"That is why I support the proposals for the system of national contributions, which places disproportionate emphasis on net balances between Member States instead of on the principle of European solidarity and the European common interest, to be slowly replaced by the Union's own resources, which the Union would collect directly and independently of national budgets."
"Even though the European Parliament's report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported, I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union's image in the eyes of its residents."
"The report suggests increasing the tax burden on European citizens, and I cannot agree to that."
"One can agree that Europe must have its own finances and that this can be done by tax collection."
"However, this would require the creation of a federal Europe, which should be done through open debates, and not through the back door using tax policy."
"If we wish to continue in this direction, we must first ensure that Member States agree to renounce their tax revenues for the good of the European Union, and only then would it be possible to create a self-financed common budget."
"To make this type of decision, European politicians must involve society, which has not happened in this case."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on the excellent work he has carried out on the important matter of the future financial perspective."
"Mr Garriga Polledo has presented the House with an effective summary encompassing the positions of the various national delegations and the various political groups."
"I strongly support the decision to request an increase in resources for the next Multiannual Financial Framework of at least 5%."
"In addition, I would like to highlight the part of the report regarding the common agricultural policy, in view of my role as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Therefore, I fully support the decision to at least retain the existing agricultural budget, while recalling that the CAP is the only real European policy that can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides goods for public use and generates real European added value."
"Finally, I would like to highlight the vote on cohesion policy, where a safeguard clause was successfully added in the event that intermediate categories are introduced in order to avoid resources being withdrawn from the regions eligible for funding under the convergence, competitiveness and cooperation objective."
"This means that additional resources will be needed to finance a new objective."
"We believe that the EU budget must be given sufficient resources to be able to finance the commitments that have been decided upon."
"At the same time, we would like to emphasise that the EU ought, as far as possible, to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget."
"We would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy, etc. set in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Therefore, we also do not believe that the 2013 budget level for agriculture should be retained, but would welcome the distribution of agricultural aid evenly between the Member States."
"We also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU's administrative expenditure, and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure."
"We do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling."
"We also see a need for a review of the EU's own resources system."
"The current system is very complicated and lacks transparency."
"The rebates have not made the system any fairer, but instead have given rise to a number of new exemptions and corrections."
"However, a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation, as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union."
"Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force."
"This motion for a European Parliament resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe is important both in terms of achieving the EU 2020 objectives (with regard to restoring and providing long-term protection for the levels of economic growth) and of preventing a recurrence of the current economic crisis."
"This report states that the Europe 2020 strategy should define the policies of the new MFF as the (EU 2020) objectives can only be achieved through optimum use of existing resources (established through the relevant policies)."
"Therefore, the process of setting the key priorities for the future MFF, such as knowledge for economic growth, cohesion for economic growth and employment, management of natural resources and sustainable development, citizenship and Global Europe, will help ensure the appropriate allocation and optimum use of existing funds."
"Drawing up a new MFF as set out in this report will help devise a long-term action plan which will produce definite results and offer the potential to ensure economic growth for the EU."
"I supported Mr Garriga Polledo's report because I found its general outlines justified in the light of the challenges that the European Union is to face over the coming years."
"It is unrealistic to transfer new responsibilities to Europe without increasing the financial resources on which it can draw."
"I would, however, have liked the European Parliament to move beyond the stage of legitimate demands and set a certain number of priorities."
"The 'ever more' refrain of a number of my fellow Members is too glib a response."
"What we need is to be convincing about the effectiveness of European expenditure compared with national expenditure."
"Furthermore, the qualitative dimension of expenditure is at least as important as the quantitative one."
"Finally, the transfer of funds unspent at European Union level to the EU budget rather than returning them to the Member States represents a source of considerable 'savings'."
"As for introducing a system of own resources, I remain extremely hesitant about the unilateral introduction of a tax on financial transactions without a serious impact study."
"Support for a measure of this nature without being aware of its implications shows that the majority of the European Parliament is on the wrong track."
"in writing. - I voted with a heavy heart against this resolution."
"While believing that good value can be obtained when 27 Member States pool their resources, I could not vote for a 5% increase in the EU budget beyond 2013 when we have not thoroughly examined existing expenditure with a view to eliminating waste and duplication."
"The EU budget beyond 2013 must prioritise growth and job creation."
"The European Union budget should provide the highest degree of European added value, be managed soundly, and leverage as many public and private resources as possible."
"In order to respond to the challenges ahead, we support the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, a strategy that should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through job creation and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"It is the policy reference for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), which should be as ambitious as possible."
"Against this background, we believe that the key priorities for the next MFF should be grouped around the following themes: knowledge for growth and employment, sustainable development, cohesion for growth and employment, citizenship and Global Europe."
"The structure of the next MFF should be realistic, facilitate planning continuity and avoid the shortcomings of the current MFF."
"It should especially strike the correct balance between stability, medium-term predictability and flexibility."
"Finally, we believe that in order to make the European Union budget more equitable and transparent, the existing exceptions and correction mechanisms should be progressively phased out."
"The Garriga report is a test to see how efficiently EU policies are working for the future programming period."
"The rapporteur presents us with a major challenge. This involves satisfying national interests, which are so diverse, while, at the same time, improving European added value, which is reflected in the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"I think that European citizens need to have a better understanding of the cohesion policy's objectives."
"A strong Europe, which is a Europe that will cope with the global competitive environment, is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in EU policies, aimed at achieving balanced development in every region."
"I want to insist on maintaining a significant proportion of the future budget outlook for the cohesion policy."
"Narrowing the economic and social disparities within the EU must continue to remain its main priority."
"In order to achieve the proposed results, we must keep the main criteria for allocating funds according to the level of development and the convergence between the EU's regions."
"I support this report because I think that supplementing the Multiannual Financial Framework after 2013 is a viable solution, which involves making changes to the current structure."
"In addition to the provision of funding for research and development and energy and transport, we must also consider investments in the areas of cohesion and agriculture."
"Mr Garriga Polledo's report 'Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe' is a very important step in the institutional and economic reorganisation of the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We all know that the new Treaty calls for new fields of competence to be reflected in the next MFF."
"This will certainly help us face the new global challenges."
"I voted in favour."
"in writing. - Labour Euro MPs believe the focus and priority for EU spending must be the funding of economic investment and research which boosts the economy and creates jobs."
"Targeted EU spending is one way in which we can boost local economies and bring jobs to our communities."
"In the face of government cuts, the EU is providing vital funds for the UK regions."
"However, taxpayers want to see better value for money."
"That is why Labour Euro MPs voted against calls for a 5% budget increase."
"Savings can and must be made in other areas, in particular, the common agricultural policy, including harmful agricultural export subsidies and tobacco subsidies, in order to fund Europe's economic priorities."
"The debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework is an opportunity for fundamental reform and it must be seized."
"A 'business as usual' policy is not an option in a Europe that needs finance for jobs and growth."
"Labour Euro MPs do not believe that families should continue to bear the full cost of the UK's budgetary contribution."
"That is why we back a debate on alternative ways to fund the EU, cutting the amount coming from VAT and the national budget through options such as coordinated measures addressing the under-taxed financial sector."
"This report makes Europe 2020 the very framework of the future European budget."
"It endorses the European semester, the European stability mechanism and the Euro Plus Pact."
"Not a single word is mentioned in connection with the nuclear issue."
"Should there be a budget for that?"
"I think not."
"At this moment, many Member States are making difficult budgetary adjustments, so defending the EU budget should be very well justified."
"The EU budget should provide the highest level of European added value (EAV), should demonstrate robust management, and should serve to stimulate public and private resources as much as possible."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is the EU's response to such challenges."
"It is a strategy which should help Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge invigorated, through the creation of jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he says that 'the Europe 2020 strategy should be the policy reference of the next [Multiannual Financial Framework] and that it should reflect the ambitions of the strategy'."
"The priorities for the next MFF should be grouped around the following issues: knowledge for growth and jobs, management of natural resources and sustainable development, cohesion for growth and jobs, citizenship, and Global Europe."
"in writing. - The report by the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources defines Parliament's political priorities for the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework."
"An important point in the report is the request for the introduction of one or several genuine own resources to replace the present GNI-based system and to achieve an autonomous, fairer, more transparent, simple and equitable financing system."
"In order to avoid abusive use of accounting figures, it is necessary to support this report."
"I voted in favour."
"Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over."
"In future years, real hard cash will be poured into these rescue mechanisms instead of guarantees."
"This will have to be financed by the net contributors, in other words, the hard-working citizens of Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria, from their national budgets; the first painful cuts are already being felt in these countries."
"Demanding budgetary increases in this difficult situation is scandalous."
"We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors."
"Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings."
"Farming subsidies, the largest and most contentious budgetary factor, should be renationalised."
"This would take the pressure off the EU budget and the Member States will be better able to respond to the specific character of their agricultural sector."
"For this reason, I have no hesitation in voting against the Garriga Polledo report."
"I voted against Amendment 39 in this report and, by extension, for Amendment 62."
"I think that an intermediary category is needed for regions for the duration of the next programming period, with the only proviso being that the allocation of funds earmarked for these regions does not affect the allocations intended for achieving the convergence and competitiveness objectives."
"Today, during the vote on the Garriga Polledo report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe, I abstained from voting on the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning the forwarding to the European Commission of suggestions regarding the introduction of a tax on financial transactions."
"I could not support this course of action, although I am an ardent supporter of a tax which would provide the EU with its own revenue."
"A European tax will guarantee that the EU's goals can be accomplished, without the constraints imposed by the positions of the Member States, which too frequently sacrifice the EU's interests to short-term goals."
"However, I believe that it is unwise to propose the introduction of a tax on financial transactions in the European Union alone."
"We are faced with the challenge of making the European economy the most competitive in the world and, in my opinion, it is unacceptable to create a burden which will result in the outflow of capital from Europe."
"Similarly, I believe that attempts to introduce a carbon tax as an alternative to FTT are exceptionally harmful."
"Europe's hardworking citizens are being required to pay more and more."
"Following the disastrous euro rescue package, which simply involved the net contributors taking a hit for the mismanagement and corruption in a few southern states, the plan is now to ask the already overburdened citizens of the net contributor countries to cough up even more money."
"Instead of taking every opportunity to save money, expenditure is being further increased."
"We should be aiming to reduce the burden, not increase it."
"I therefore voted against this motion."
"We must establish a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that would ensure the transparent and efficient financing of EU policy and would prevent a repetition of the crisis."
"The Europe 2020 strategy should be the implementation reference for the MFF."
"Above all, any new system for financing the budget should not increase the burden on national treasuries or the tax burden for citizens."
"In order to reduce EU citizens' dissatisfaction with current expenditure, it is necessary to improve the quality of the implementation and application of expenditure."
"We must increase transparency in the allocation and use of funds and reduce administrative costs and bureaucracy."
"Significant attention should be paid to reducing poverty and unemployment, to industry and energy, and the creation of a knowledge-based society."
"We must provide for adequate financing for large-scale research and development projects."
"Given the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the appropriate financial resources must be put towards improving their operating conditions."
"I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the financing allocated to the common agricultural policy in the future because agriculture is a particularly sensitive sector."
"Reduced financing will have particularly negative consequences for farmers in all EU countries."
"The European Social Fund should become a political priority in order to achieve social and employment goals."
"We must improve systems for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of cohesion policy."
"As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure."
"I voted for the report by Mr Garriga Polledo because I believe that in the future, financial instruments should be efficient, strengthen cohesion and prepare the European Union for the challenges of the global market."
"I agree with the content of the text, although there are two points that I did not agree with and which I opposed: the tax on financial transactions and the amendments to introduce the 'intermediate category'."
"I do not believe that a reference to the tax on financial transactions should be included in this report."
"A debate about this tax is important, but it requires in-depth analysis."
"The addition of an intermediate category, on the other hand, would compromise the horizontal approach for Objective 2 regions, which has proven to be effective in recent years, the phasing-out system and funds for Objective 1 regions."
"This would hurt Italian regions to the benefit of regions in the new Member States which, with the recent enlargement, have already received a huge share of funding."
"The new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is crucial in order for the Europe 2020 strategy to be properly realised and, in general terms, to be able to provide the conditions for robust development which can respond both to the problems that Europe's various peoples are experiencing and to their expectations of improvement in their lives."
"In this context, I commend the author of the report for the proposal of a seven-year MFF, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, subject to mid-term review, advocating, as a minimum: the maintaining of the EU budget, with particular emphasis on the common agricultural policy (CAP) and on cohesion policy; a greater sense of flexibility, which becomes more necessary as the financial constraints become more tangible; and also greater democratic responsibility, so that European funds can genuinely promote development projects that are capable of being sustainable."
"In this context, it is important that regions that have already emerged from Objective 1 are able to move to an intermediate stage, reinforcing the development which they have already proven themselves capable of, instead of them being abruptly abandoned, jeopardising the progress that has been achieved in the meantime."
"We have a positive view of the report's focus on the common challenges that we are facing: climate and environmental issues, the fight for democracy, peace and freedom at a global level and the urgent need for research, innovation and infrastructure."
"The Europe 2020 strategy and investment in initiatives with European added value permeated the debates during the work on the report."
"However, we are deeply concerned about the fact that we have passed the authority to set priorities over to the Council."
"This is very unfortunate for the European Parliament."
"Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Europe are included, it is impossible to finance everything all at once from the EU budget."
"We want a realistic and practicable negotiating strategy, but as no clear priorities have been set in this report, we feel that this goal has not been fulfilled."
"Our proposals to modernise the agricultural budget were not included in the final document."
"For these reasons, among others, we abstained in the final vote."
"I voted in favour of the report presented by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013."
"In a context where populism is on the increase, the effectiveness and even relevance of EU policies are regularly brought into question."
"Nonetheless, in the face of current crises, whether financial, economic, social or climatic, we do not need less but rather more Europe."
"This report therefore proposes finally giving the EU the resources to match its ambitions, by arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget of a minimum of 5% and a mobilisation of the budgetary resources of the Union for the benefit of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Thanks to action by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the European Parliament also argues in this report for two strong measures: as far as revenue is concerned, an in-depth reform of the own resources system, in particular, through the creation of a tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax); as far as expenditure is concerned, the creation of a category of 'intermediate regions' to increase solidarity between the territories of the EU and ensure a fairer distribution of the regional policy's Structural Funds."
"The combination of a smaller working population and a higher share of retired people will place additional strains on social welfare systems and economic competitiveness, causing increasingly significant problems in terms of gender poverty, given the high number of elderly women and current disparities in social protection."
"The importance must be emphasised of gender budgeting as a good governance tool to improve efficiency and fairness, proper monitoring of how budgetary allocations affect the economic and social opportunities of men and women, and flexibility to restructure the ones that negatively affect the achievement of gender equality."
"Specific measures to develop the technical and scientific skills of young women need to be included in the European investment plan for employment, environmental protection and innovation, in order to improve their qualifications and employability, in particular, in strategic growth sectors in which they are under-represented."
"The European Social Fund (ESF) should provide adequate resources for measures aimed at improving labour market access and combating unemployment and social exclusion."
"At the same time, I call on the European Commission to propose active measures through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in order to support women's employment in rural areas."
"in writing. - Renegotiation of the EU budget will impact on how the Union operates in the coming years and on the programmes it can afford."
"The budget as a percentage of the EU Gross National Income should reflect the agreed priorities of the European Union."
"But the negotiations must also reflect Member States' needs in light of the consolidation efforts under way in many countries, including Ireland."
"The aim to boost employment, productivity and social cohesion in the Europe 2020 growth strategy cannot be discarded because of the current financial problems."
"Productivity-enhancing policies, particularly those in green energy and research and development, must be recognised as the driver of the EU's economic future."
"Another issue of major importance, not just to Ireland but to the EU as a whole, is the common agricultural policy."
"It is recognised that significant change is coming after 2013, but changes to payments under the CAP should gradually evolve to allow farmers to adjust to the new arrangements."
"At the same time, the CAP budget must help European farmers adapt to new challenges and opportunities."
"The EU Multiannual Financial Framework represents an opportunity to make strategic choices for the future."
"In fact, at a time of profound contrition in state action, the increasing of EU budgets represents an act of confidence in the common project and of reinforcement of action undertaken at supranational level."
"In fact, there is a series of challenges facing Member States, whose proper solutions can only be found at EU level."
"in writing. - (FR) To do more with less money, as certain Member States recommend, is mission impossible!"
"That is why the report adopted this afternoon on the new post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework is important."
"It provides guidelines to enable the European Union truly to enter a period of competitiveness, solidarity and good governance."
"It points out that, in the absence of significant reallocations within the additional resources budget, Europe will never be able to accomplish the new missions assigned to it under the Treaty of Lisbon nor embark on the road towards sustainable growth."
"However, there are very many domains which can contribute to synergies or economies of scale: the European External Action Service, humanitarian aid and civil protection, pooling of resources in defence, research and innovation, major infrastructure projects (especially in the areas of energy and transport)."
"Another idea that has mileage in it is to gradually abandon subsidies that are harmful to the environment, along the lines of what the Commission has done for tobacco."
"I am also pleased that the European Parliament has reaffirmed its support for own resources because it is only right that the Union should manage its own budget."
"I voted against the amendments to Mr Garriga Polledo's report calling for intermediate categories of regions, or regions with per capita gross domestic product between 75% and 90% of European Union GDP, to be introduced for the next financial programming period."
"This innovation is apparently one of openness and greater financial flexibility, but in a period of austerity and budget restrictions like the present, it will inevitably lead to cuts in funding for other regions, particularly Objective 1 (convergence) regions, which specifically include the regions of southern Italy."
"I note with regret that my fellow Members failed to pick up on this aspect and have allowed themselves to be influenced by reasoning that goes against the principles of European solidarity."
"Fortunately, Amendment 64, which was approved, underlines that these transitional measures must not in any case be established at the expense of the current convergence, competitiveness and cooperation (Objectives 1, 2 and 3) regions."
"The responses we should bring to the challenges that face us - the economic crisis, the rapid rise of the emerging economies, climate change, turbulent demographic change and so on - can only be effective if we create them collectively, at European level."
"I am absolutely convinced that we should move in the direction of greater involvement of the European Union."
"While the EU budget is a major political lever, the ceiling on the EU's own resources has remained unchanged since 1993."
"This resolution calls for the European budget to be allocated resources equal to the EU's ambitions."
"I am wholly in favour of this idea and give it my support."
"Personally, I am particularly in favour of implementing the European tax on financial transactions as quickly as possible, if we cannot have an agreement at world level."
"Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union's budget, as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit, at least in part, I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax."
"in writing. - In favour."
"As my colleague, Bas Eickhout, said before, freezing or decreasing the EU's budget post-2013 is not a credible approach if the EU and its Member States are serious about achieving the policy priorities they have set themselves, notably in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Coordinating EU funding and actions is clearly a better way for us to achieve our common goals, as opposed to individual actions."
"We welcome the fact that MEPs have clearly set out their stall to this end ahead of the forthcoming debate on the future financing of the EU."
"The EU needs a proper and predictable system for financing its own budget in order to end the perpetual, damaging squabbling over national contributions to the EU budget."
"Introducing a true and meaningful 'own-resources' system for financing the EU budget is the only way to achieve this and we are happy that the EP has thrown its weight behind this long-standing Green priority."
"I believe that with today's vote, the European Parliament has sent a strong and clear signal to the Member States asking to freeze the European Union budget for 2014-2020."
"This substantial reduction in resources is not, in fact, a valid choice for those who believe in a truly competitive Europe, and the countries pursuing it should clearly specify which priority projects will have to be abandoned in order to allow for these cuts."
"The bad habit of making political commitments without having the necessary financial resources must be broken because it undermines the planning and credibility of the whole European system."
"Reducing long-term budgets could compromise both the increase in expenditure on research and innovation and investment in infrastructure, foreign policy and enlargement."
"Furthermore, to reduce them now would have serious consequences for the future of all the Member States."
"Within the framework of voting on 'Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe', I voted in favour of creating an intermediate category of regions with a per capita GNP between 75% and 90% of the Union's GNP."
"Ten French regions should benefit from the creation of this new category, including Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie."
"The creation of this third category of regions will enable them to benefit from funding for employment, sustainable growth and competitiveness."
"Another important point in this report is that it supports the creation of a system of funding the European budget that is transparent, simpler and more equitable."
"Amongst the measures put forward by the Commission, there is the creation of a tax on financial transactions."
"Parliament regularly speaks in favour of this, and I strongly support this measure which will improve how the market operates by reducing speculation, by contributing to financing global public goods and to reducing budget deficits."
"While I would have liked a more ambitious outcome, the Garriga Polledo report on the financial perspective from 2014 is a step forward, the result of a broad political compromise within the Special committee, created for the first time in Parliament, before the Commission presents its proposal."
"The report acknowledges the need for more resources to be put in place to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, to develop European policies and to meet the commitments arising from enlargement and the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It advocates new own resources, opening the door to a fiscal union and a tax on financial transactions which should be extended to the rest of the world."
"From 2020, it proposes five-year periods (or five-plus-five-year periods) which are more in tune with the mandate of the institutions."
"I consider the support for activities related to the sea and the creation of a new category for regions that have between 75% and 90% of EU per capita income to be very positive for Galicia."
"This is necessary in order to avoid the flow of EU funds being interrupted and to provide a transition towards improved competitiveness and the promotion of convergence on a sustainable development path."
"When the European Parliament voted on Wednesday 8 June on investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe, I chose to vote against the report."
"At a time when the EU Member States find themselves under serious budgetary pressure, I am disappointed to see that, instead of setting priorities, the European Parliament is choosing to increase the budget by at least 5%."
"The European Parliament voted for contributions to continue in areas that keep the European economy locked in its old ways, by, among other things, setting aside amounts for the common agricultural policy that are at least as large as for the 2013 budget year."
"I am also opposed to the European Parliament's proposal to reform the EU's financing by introducing an own resources system."
"Some of these resources are intended to come from a financial transaction tax (FTT)."
"in writing. - I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland."
"The MMF Garriga Report seeks to increase funding from Member States for the period 2014-2020 by 5%, and this I cannot support at a time when extreme adversity is being experienced in the UK from the government's dangerous and socially divisive austerity measures."
"I do support many of the measures promoted in the report and in the Green's amendments, particularly around the Green New Deal, the end of national rebates and Own Resources for the EU, and am mindful that part of the above-inflation increase is needed to meet obligations under the Lisbon Treaty."
"There are, however, many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn't be supported, and I'm thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example."
"My argument is that if there isn't enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions, ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls."
"Europe 2020 is the European strategy seeking to respond to the new global challenges for the EU and its various Member States, so it is important to structure the economic and financial conditions which will guide its application in the 2014-2021 period."
"This report aims to contribute to setting out the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), approving a 5% increase in budget appropriations on the current MFF, the maintenance of funding for cohesion and agriculture, and a financial strengthening of the areas of research, development and innovation, and of energy and transport."
"I voted in favour of the report since I view the strategic content as a positive and, overall, since the budget is in line with the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The strengthening of economic governance and the importance of cohesion policy are some of the areas that I would like to emphasise in the pursuit of a smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive Europe."
"I consider it important to create an intermediate category for regions whose per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is between 75% and 90% of EU GDP, thus contributing to increased equality at regional level."
"However, I would like to stress that this new category should not harm the more disadvantaged regions in terms of the allocation of EU funding."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party voted against the report because it expresses in no uncertain terms the strategic policies and economic priorities of monopoly capital, which the EU is being called upon to serve and implement over forthcoming years, on the back of the unfolding capitalist crisis."
"The information from the current financial framework illustrates that, instead of being used to satisfy grassroots needs, the funds available under the euro-unifying budget are being directed against them, in order to support the profitability of the monopoly groups."
"It is a dirty lie that the basic feature of the report is the alleged demand by the European Parliament for spending under the EU budget to be increased by 5% after 2013."
"Its predominant feature is that it calls not only for this increase, but for all spending under the EU budget to be directed towards promoting the barbaric measures unleashed by capital, the EU and the bourgeois governments against the working classes and grassroots classes in all the Member States."
"It calls for the money of the workers of the Member States which finances the EU budget to be used to promote capitalist restructurings, to sweep away labour rights, to support the profitability of euro-unifying monopolies, to consolidate the mechanisms of the 'memoranda' and secure lenders in the debtor Member States and to support repressive mechanisms and imperialist interference by the EU."
"Today, I voted in favour of creating 'intermediate regions', and I am pleased that this position was adopted by Parliament as a whole."
"This decision will mean that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States (such as Mazovia and Warsaw) will still receive support."
"The position adopted by Parliament today is the first victory in the battle over the shape of the new financial perspective for the period 2014-2020."
"For Poland, and also for Warsaw, a key factor will be the level of funding and the priorities set out under the cohesion fund."
"The Garriga Polledo report assumes a figure of between 75 and 90% for the intermediate category for regional support."
"This range is unacceptable to me because it offers the prospect of payments to few areas that require support, including in the western part of the EU."
"This goes against the actual aim of regional support, namely the strengthening of the weakest regions."
"The next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is a perfect opportunity to show European residents that the Union can achieve long-term goals, such as stimulating strong growth and internal cohesion."
"We must not miss such an opportunity."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur stresses the importance of cohesion policy for growth and employment."
"For Lithuanians, it is crucial that the sums earmarked for cohesion policy in the next MFF are not smaller than those in this financial period."
"European cohesion policy continues to play an important role in reducing significant social and economic disparities among the Member States."
"For instance, Lithuania's GDP per capita remains low (when we joined the EU, it was 48% of the Union average)."
"However, it is believed that by 2020, Lithuania's GDP will be at least 50% greater than it was without cohesion policy assistance."
"Lithuania's goal of improving transport infrastructure and accessibility (23% of the entire allocation of Structural Fund money), enhancing its R&D capacity (22%), and supporting business creation, depends on cohesion policy."
"Dwindling cohesion policy funds will continue to crush our economy."
"We must not allow this to happen."
"Trust in the EU will only return when our citizens are convinced that the Union serves their values and interests."
"in writing. - By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 (with 54 abstentions), the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times."
"When such tough economic decisions are being made at home, (...) it is unacceptable for the EU to take no action to cut costs and eliminate waste. (...)"
"The Parliament decided to ignore the letter of the British Prime Minister, (...) and the Heads of Government of France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, that there must be no increase in the EU Budget (...)."
"Indeed, many of us want budget cuts and a reduction in Britain's excessive contribution. (...)."
"The British public (...) will not accept taxes imposed by the EU and nor would the citizens of the other (...) countries, if they but realised what was going on (...)."
"Informed economic opinion will tell you that lower taxes are the best incentive to economic growth and job creation."
"This report is intended to provide the financial foundations of the EU superstate which I and my constituents (...) reject."
"I joined my fellow Conservatives in voting against this report."

"Revised Hungarian constitution (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the revised Hungarian constitution."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Treaty has not conferred any power on the Council to deal with national constitutions of the Member States."
"Under Article 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the European Union, the adoption of a constitution remains in the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned."
"Therefore, the Council has not been in a position to discuss the newly adopted constitution of Hungary."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, at President Barroso's request, I am addressing the House here today on the subject of the Hungarian constitution."
"At the outset, President Barroso stressed on various occasions that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices of a Member State."
"The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people, for its institutions in accordance with the applicable national law and, where relevant, Union and international law."
"The Commission may, however, assess the constitution - as it may any other legal act of a Member State - from the perspective of its compliance with Union law."
"It goes without saying that the constitution of every Member State should reflect and comply with the European values of freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human dignity and respect of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, without discrimination, as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty."
"The new Hungarian constitution will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and will require the adoption of implementing measures."
"Therefore, at this stage, the Commission can only make a preliminary analysis, as the precise view on the interaction of the constitution with Union law and its legal effects can only be fully evaluated when taking into account the implementing legislative, administrative and judicial practice based on it."
"The Commission is also following the work of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe on this matter, and we are expecting a report on 17-18 June."
"I also know that Thomas Markert, the secretary of the Venice Commission, was in the Committee on Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 25 May, and I read with great interest the remarks which he made."
"As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence."
"We can become competent only when such matters are translated into legislation."
"I now want to listen to what you parliamentarians have to say in order to understand the position of the European Parliament on this matter."
"Madam President, please do not regard my attitude as impolite but I will address the left of the House: the majority comprising Greens, Communists, Socialists and Liberals, who forced this topic on today's agenda in contradiction with the PPE and Conservative groups."
"I have questions for you."
"Do you find it compatible with the prohibition of discrimination based on birth that the European Union has Member States, such as Spain, Belgium or Sweden, where citizens are entitled to hold high-ranking state positions, for instance that of the monarch, based on their birth?"
"My country's new constitution does not apply such discrimination."
"Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance the United Kingdom, that do not have a unified written constitution?"
"My country's new constitution is a democratic, written constitution."
"Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance France, whose constitution does not contain fundamental rights?"
"My country's new constitution not only contains fundamental rights, but it is the first in the European Union to take the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a standard."
"Do you think it is acceptable that the Union has Member States where there is no constitutional court, or where there is one, but its powers are weak?"
"My country's new constitution is proud to guarantee a strong constitutional protection."
"You claim to act in the spirit of a common Europe when you drag the new Hungarian constitution here for dissection."
"In effect, however, you are betraying one of the most important principles of the Treaty of Lisbon, namely Article 4(2): 'The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional'."
"If you have not organised or will not organise debates concerning the states I have mentioned above, or failed to remember here, in the European Parliament, that the socialist government of Hungary blatantly ignored the right to assembly in 2006, then you, ladies and gentlemen, are using double measures."
"You can see the mote in your brother's eye but not the beam in your own."
"You do not realise that you are not supporting European cooperation with this attitude, but you are provoking conflicts between the European nations."
"This reveals your real partisan bias."
"I would suggest you follow the example set by the new Hungarian constitution in your countries."
"Curb indebtedness by constitutional methods to prevent another Greek, Irish, or Portuguese crisis from happening."
"I suggest you protect with constitutional methods the rights of future generations, just as the new Hungarian constitution does, raising environmental, budgetary, and demographic sustainability to the level of constitutional principles."
"Protect your nationalities and minorities, for instance the Roma, with strong, collective rights, just as the new Hungarian constitution does, uniquely in Europe."
"You keep repeating unjustified charges, although we have disproved them and have proved our position time and time again, but I am telling you once more: the new Hungarian constitution does not ban abortion."
"The new Hungarian constitution does not prejudice the freedom of religion and freedom of conscience."
"The new Hungarian constitution does not restrict the rights of same-sex people."
"The new Hungarian constitution has no competence beyond the country's geographical area and provides unparalleled, strong legal protection for the nationalities within its area."
"The new Hungarian constitution does not weaken, but strengthens the principles of division of power, and checks and balances."
"The new Hungarian constitution is a European constitution in spirit, born in the spirit of ensuring all fundamental human rights to its citizens, and of cooperation and unity of nations."
"In our constitution, there are 18 references to Europe, and we included 'Unity in diversity', the motto of the European Union, in it as well."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we, Hungarians, are a nation that likes freedom and democracy."
"We do not need to be lectured about democracy by those who have plenty of homework to do in their own backyards."
"Madam President, the European Union is a union of values and a union in law."
"It is defined as an instance of supranational integration of Member States, each one of which is a reputably constitutional state."
"There is also a constitutional dimension to the European Union itself, however, insofar as not only is the architecture of its institutions subject to the law but there are also guarantees enshrined in law to protect the position of individuals with regard to the government authorities in Europe, and there exists an essential principle, that of democracy, which exalts pluralism."
"That is surely why this revision of the Hungarian constitution is being debated in the European Parliament and has been the subject of consideration by two of this House's committees in particular, namely, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE)."
"I think the primary concern can be summarised as the one underlying the impression that what is certainly a very large political majority, a two-thirds majority, but nonetheless a circumstantial political majority in the Hungarian Parliament, has succeeded in forcing a constitutional reform that places constraints on the achievement of political pluralism and, consequently, on the possibility of alternating between different political projects under the same set of rules of play."
"I think that is why it has caused concern, from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"No one has sought to prejudge what the Hungarian constitution will be or how it will be applied in practice and it will, of course, be subject to the checks and balances provided by the constitutional system, the constitutional balance of the Hungarian constitution itself and the fact that Hungary is subject to supranational bodies such as the Council of Europe and the European Union, which know about fundamental rights."
"I must refer, however, to what I have just heard regarding the protection of minorities under the Spanish constitution, which has been set up as an example to some other constitutions that have been mentioned by Mr Szájer."
"I cannot overlook this."
"With all due respect, I must inform Mr Szájer that no shadow of discrimination by reason of origin or birth exists in the Spanish constitution."
"No one is seeking to prejudge the outcome of the implementation of the Hungarian constitution but I do think that this Parliament is concerned that the Hungarian constitution must also adhere to the rule of accreditation of political pluralism and the alternation of different political projects under the same set of rules of play."
"This debate and those that have preceded it are testimony to that concern."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the new fundamental law of Hungary - one would say a far too controversial text for a constitution - has been rushed through the Hungarian Parliament after only one month of public consultations."
"Hungarian civil society and the Venice Commission have expressed serious concerns regarding the duration and transparency of the process."
"Sometimes, those questioning this text have been accused of doing so for purely political reasons."
"One expected the new Hungarian constitution - 20 years after the fall of the Communist regime and at a time when Hungary holds the Presidency of the European Union - to entirely reflect the most cherished values in the EU."
"Are these only political values?"
"I admit that as a Liberal, I am worried about government eroding civil liberties and democratic control."
"I am worried about legislation turning a blind eye to diversity, and I am convinced that not all Hungarian citizens recognise themselves in the conservative image portrayed by the constitution."
"How could I remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh Hungarian media law?"
"We should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections, and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies."
"And yes, I am worried about the spill-over of these Hungarian patterns."
"My own country's leaders have been inspired by these actions, and some recent amendments to our Romanian constitution seem to be copied and pasted."
"They will not be approved, but the attempt is there."
"European institutions must not be shy at such times."
"We need to strive to make all European citizens feel not worried but reassured that our values are at the core of our legislation and are there to stay."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, this debate is an evaluation of the situation regarding the new Hungarian constitution, not the common law of the United Kingdom which has protected our citizens for nearly 900 years."
"It is the Commission which is charged with assessing and acting on such issues as are laid out in the Treaties, and as requested by this Parliament only a few months ago."
"This House was hoping to ask the Commission what its conclusions are and how it intends to proceed, and we still look forward to your guidance, but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer."
"This is a Union of different cultures and differing priorities. However, we all share values of freedom, fairness and equality for every person and every Member State."
"What we should not tolerate is intolerance itself."
"What we ask now is for you, Commissioner, to give this House, as soon as possible, a definitive answer as to whether the Hungarian constitution is in line with European legislation and fundamental rights."
"If it is not, what next?"
"If it is, Commissioner, we need to know that, too, as soon as we can."
"Madam President, I thank my fellow Member from the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who wants to start a debate with us here about the Hungarian constitution."
"That is laudable, because when I hear the representative of the European Council say 'We have not discussed this in the Council', and when I hear Commissioner Reding say 'A country's constitution is up to that country alone and it is not for us, at European level, to interfere with that', then I am glad that we in the European Parliament are, indeed, having this debate amongst ourselves."
"Are we really not supposed to get involved?"
"Is this a purely Hungarian affair?"
"I would not say so."
"The state of democracy in a Member State of the EU does concern the other Member States."
"If a country chooses to use a fair election and a two-thirds majority to create an autocracy, the rest of us are allowed to be shocked by that and to try and oppose it."
"I quote György Konrád here, who says: 'In Hungary, a so-called majority knows how to create an autocratic regime in a democratic way'."
"That is true."
"If you push a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decree that, from now on, it may only be amended with a two-thirds majority, you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election."
"This sort of thing erodes the function of elections as a democratic instrument."
"It is the right of a nation to say every four years, 'We liked this, but we did not like that', and to then bring about changes."
"However, if a democratically elected regime sets things up so that no amendments can be made for many years after, that is unhealthy and wrong."
"If we in Europe avert our eyes and say 'This is purely a Hungarian affair', if 26 Member States are not prepared to say, 'Friends, we do not treat people like that in our society', and if the European Commission says the same, what should we then say, as a group, to countries where the situation is even worse?"
"What should we tell those Hungarians who are not part of the two-thirds majority?"
"'Terribly sorry, you will not have any chance to reverse these laws after the next two elections, either'."
"I find it absolutely appalling that all of us in Europe are averting our eyes and that we are failing to take action."
"Madam President, in this debate on the Hungarian constitution, we have, in fact, been having two debates."
"One is on the debate on the content of the constitution, and the other is a debate about the debate; in other words, on knowing whether it is legitimate or not to make pronouncements on the content of the Hungarian constitution in this Parliament or in any other institution outside of Hungary itself."
"Regarding the debate on the content, we know that there are many parts that are of concern to us in Parliament, to the specific committees that have debated this document, or to the Venice Commission, for example."
"The issue of non-discrimination ..."
"Mr Szájer tells us that it is not true that discrimination against, for example, gender or sexual minorities is not provided for, because there is a reference to all types of discrimination."
"As far as I am concerned, that reference is too vague and leaves too much room for subsequent court judgments contradicting it."
"It should be stipulated in the constitution, as is the norm in European countries, and as is the norm in the most advanced and progressive democracies."
"The same goes for the foetus, the protection of the foetus, or, for example, for the Hungarian Republic's checks and balances."
"However, we then have the debate about the debate, and the debate about the legitimacy of this issue being pronounced on in Parliament must also be fought very clearly."
"This is because, firstly, constitutions are not watertight."
"It needs to be said that wherever there are violations of fundamental rights, the 500 million citizens expect the European institutions to make pronouncements."
"Whether that violation is made by a law, by a constitution, or by a regulation, is irrelevant: wherever there is a violation of fundamental rights, it is not permitted under the Treaties."
"Secondly, the explanation that, due to cultural differences, a constitution may be, let us say, free from criticism, is pure constitutional relativism."
"That cannot be the case."
"The fact of a constitution violating the spirit and letter of the Treaties, if that were the case, means it would be violating the sovereignty of the other 26 countries that have agreed to be in a European Union with the country that was able to violate the Treaties."
"It is therefore an issue for the sovereignty of all."
"I would like to take this opportunity to just say one thing."
"The two-thirds majority - very often invoked here, and which, in fact, comes from 50% rather than two thirds of the votes cast by Hungarian citizens, since they make up two thirds of the Members of the Hungarian Parliament, but only 50% of the votes - serves for one thing everywhere: to confer a broad social consensus on the constitution."
"Those in power in Hungary have just used the two-thirds majority for exactly the opposite purpose: to exclude the opposition, ensuring that the constitution is extremely controversial in their society."
"It may be following the letter of the two-thirds rule, but it is violating its spirit."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(BG) Mr Tavares, I have a very brief question for you."
"On whose authority do you speak on behalf of all 500 million European citizens?"
"This is because you are speaking out very boldly on their behalf."
"However, I think that if Europe's citizens were to be consulted, their comments will not reflect exactly what you have said."
"Everyone in this Parliament has different views and represents different sections of European citizens."
"Therefore, on whose authority do you speak on behalf of all of them?"
"Madam President, Mr Stoyanov, I would encourage you to read the Union Treaties and the Rules of Procedure of this House, which state that we, being elected by the European citizens, should represent our own Member States and citizens, and the 500 million citizens of the European Union as a whole."
"We are given a mandate by those citizens to respect and to make others respect the fundamental Treaties of the European Union, which protect the rights of their citizens."
"It is very simple: whilst we have such a mandate, Mr Stoyanov and I have as much a right as each other to speak on behalf of the 500 million European citizens in this House, which belongs to the citizens."
"Madam President, the revised Hungarian constitution of April this year has become the subject of justified criticism by the whole of European democratic society."
"It has introduced into the Hungarian legal system provisions which ignore international law and are in direct conflict with the accepted international obligations of the Hungarian Republic."
"The ruling Fidesz party has introduced into the constitution versions of texts through which Hungary usurps the right to decide on the status, rights and political organisation of all Hungarian-speaking citizens in surrounding states."
"It has also reserved the right to provide all of these citizens of surrounding states, who have no links to Hungary whatsoever, with Hungarian citizenship, the right to vote in Hungary, the right to social security or education under Hungarian regulations and universal Hungarian diplomatic protection."
"Under international law, the organisation of a political system is a sovereign matter of sovereign states, and therefore we cannot view the provisions of the Hungarian constitution under which Hungary reserves the right to decide on the organisation of the life of citizens of other states as anything other than a primitive and crude attack on calm and peaceful coexistence in Europe."
"The idea of one nation, one empire and so on is not new."
"This swarthy little Hitler, who has abused it for the last time in his desire for power and glory in Europe, was long ago condemned by the decent, civilised and democratic world."
"I would therefore like to believe that democratic political forces in the Hungarian Parliament will correct all of the errors in another legislative process, and will amend the constitution to bring it into line with international law and Hungary's international obligations."
"(BG) Madam President, I think that Parliament should apologise to the Commissioner for getting her involved in this debate."
"This is because it has become patently obvious to everyone in this Chamber from what she said - at least it is basically to me, but I do not know whether it has become clear to everyone else - that new legislation implementing Hungary's constitution still needs to be adopted, and then it will become clear whether anyone's rights are being violated."
"We are in a situation once again where a debate is going on here in Parliament intended to condemn a Member State for something which it has not yet done."
"Fellow Members, in which of your Member States is anyone judged for something which they have not done?"
"Or condemned for something which they have not done?"
"None."
"This is something that contradicts democratic values."
"The people who initiated this debate must apologise not only to the Commissioner, but also to all European citizens, because it is precisely this kind of behaviour from Parliament which leads to a lack of interest from European citizens in its activities, disappointment and low voter turnout in European Parliament elections."
"Madam President, this debate on the Hungarian constitution today is flawed for two main reasons."
"It singles out one Member State out of 27, and it concerns a national issue which falls within the sovereignty of Member States."
"First of all, if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution, we should not single out one constitution of one Member State."
"We should, if anything, debate the constitutions of each and every Member State."
"Some of the elements which are being contested can, in fact, be found in a number of other constitutions in other Member States, and yet we are only debating one constitution in one Member State."
"This is wrong."
"Secondly, one has to ask what power, what competence, do we have to bring the issue of a national constitution to the European Parliament in the first place?"
"Member States have a sovereign competence for establishing their own national constitutions, and in this case, we should respect the right of the Hungarian people to determine their own constitution adopted by their democratically-elected national parliament."
"The debate we are having today on the content of this constitution should, if anything, be held amongst Hungarian people, and not in this House."
"Whether we like it or not, whether we disagree or agree with this national constitution, we must respect the sovereignty and the hierarchy of law, otherwise we would be setting a dangerous precedent."
"So when we single out a Member State, and when we try to act outside our competence, we send a wrong signal."
"We would stand accused of political instrumentalisation, and we would be undermining the trust of citizens in our own institution."
"We should not go down this dangerous road."
"(SK) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to declare unambiguously that we recognise the right of all EU Member States to make their own laws, and thus we do not want to criticise either Hungary or, in particular, the citizens of Hungary."
"Our comments and concerns are not directed towards a criticism of Hungary and Hungarian citizens, but we firmly believe that the defence of fundamental rights, civic freedoms, our shared European values, and peace, security and decent coexistence is a sufficient reason for us to hold this discussion today."
"We also hope that the discussion and presentation of our questions and concerns can lead to improvement and to better preparation of the implementing legislation mentioned earlier."
"Commissioner, just like you, we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr Markert, that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least."
"Weak points have been seen in the Hungarian constitution not only by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but also by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"If we ignore the Romantic, almost monarchist ideas which pervade the spirit of the preamble, I would like to mention some areas we regard as being highly sensitive, in contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz who are also Members of the European Parliament."
"One example is the principle mentioned earlier for adopting the constitution."
"It is not very normal in democratic countries for a consultation process to last only five weeks."
"It is not normal for the opposition not to participate in it, and, despite the fact that Fidesz has the necessary majority, it has to be said that victors have a duty to show humility."
"The restriction on the powers of the constitutional court has already been mentioned, and on behalf of our group, I would also like to mention the discriminatory nature of the constitution in relation to members of sexual minorities, as it fails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation."
"The protection of Hungarian minorities abroad, to which Article D applies directly, also applies to people of Hungarian ethnicity living in neighbouring countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the mission of the European Union is surely for us to live together as nations and as states of the European Union in peace, cooperation and mutual respect."
"How should we, from the countries directly affected, perceive this constitution?"
"How can you expect us to accept it?"
"Unlike you, we have always extended the hand of friendship to you, and we have always wanted decent coexistence, and we would therefore like the implementing regulations for your constitution to respect the sovereignty of neighbouring states in the region."
"Madam President, it is untenable to say that the constitution of a Member State is a matter only for itself."
"The Treaties, in Articles 6 and 7, make it crystal clear not only that the Union and the Member States share certain values, but that the Commission has the duty to police respect for those values."
"I wholly subscribe to what my colleague, Renate Weber, eloquently said: I do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling Fidesz party in Hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired."
"Many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan, such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers."
"But I want to give a good example of one flaw in the constitution that undermines the Treaty's insistence on the rule of law."
"This is the declaration that the 1949 constitution is invalid. Not just repealed, but invalid."
"This creates great legal uncertainty as it leaves in limbo, and apparently invalid themselves, laws passed under that constitution including in respect of Hungary's accession and EU membership."
"This is one reason why the Commission should examine it for compliance with EU law and it could have a great effect on other Member States."
"Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution demolishes the pillars of a democracy based on the rule of law and opens the way to autocracy."
"This is a major setback on the road of transition."
"The process of preparing and adopting the new constitution was hardly legitimate."
"The preamble is exclusionary and reflects a distorted interpretation of history."
"The main text represents an intrusion into private life, basic human and citizens' rights are defined in a narrow way, social rights are substituted by state objectives."
"Checks and balances are weakened, especially the independence of the judiciary."
"The European Council, Parliament and Commission cannot ignore these violations of European values, because this may set a negative precedent for other illiberal regimes to follow."
"Nevertheless, the democrats of Hungary do not expect the remedy to come from abroad."
"Were it to happen that way, it would only reinforce the view of the Hungarian Prime Minister, who compared the EU to the Soviet Union."
"The solution can come only from the Hungarian citizens, who will reject this constitution when they realise that an autocratic regime cannot provide high living standards and more freedom."
"Twenty-one years ago, we were not required to fight for freedom."
"Now we are."
"In the meantime, Europe should keep its watchful eye on Hungary and encourage the Hungarian democrats to regain the initiative."
"Madam President, I strongly disagree with all of those who have said that it is not respecting sovereignty if we debate and criticise a Member State's constitution here, or that it would, as somebody has said, be a dangerous precedent and acting outside of European competence."
"The constitutions of Member States have to be in accordance with European values, with our value community which we have defined."
"There are at least two things I would like to mention which are not in line with that."
"Others have mentioned others."
"The first is that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is not included and that has to be included in the future."
"Also, marriage and family values as defined there go beyond the reality of people living in Europe and in Hungary, and it is not the rule of diversity that we have."
"One other thing relates to the so-called Green Ombudsman for the rights of future generations on environment and sustainability."
"This post is now subordinated to the general Ombudsman, as other Ombudsmen have been, and so it is weakened."
"This is also an area where competences are taken out of the sphere of regulations that were there before, and it makes clear that the issue of sustainability, environmental protection and the rights of future generations - another part of European values - which needs to be important, is no longer as important as it was before."
"One last point: there was also an Ombudsman on data protection."
"That post has been abolished totally, so transparency of information about the State, for example on public procurement, is not there anymore."
"This is something that is heavily criticised by me and by my group."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mrs Lunacek, I would like to ask you whether you can list the Member States of the European Union whose constitution includes the institution of an ombudsman or commissioner for the rights of future generations."
"How many Member States have such an institution as the one in Hungary that is actually functioning and is mentioned in the Hungarian constitution?"
"Also, assuming you have read the current Hungarian constitution, the new Hungarian constitution adopted in April, can you name constitutions which contain more and farther reaching articles on environmental protection and future generations than the new Hungarian constitution?"
"I challenge you to name them."
"Madam President, my reply to Ms Gál is as follows."
"The issue was not a comparison with other Member States' constitutions."
"The issue was: what is a European value?"
"What is part of our fundamental rights?"
"What is enshrined in the common values that I hope you share as well?"
"With regard to the rights of future generations, environmental sustainability is something that is enshrined in the rights of our common European Union."
"Some Member States have that and others might not have it, but the fact is that in the new constitution, the government of Hungary has abolished this symbolic Ombudsman."
"There is now only one Ombudsman and the symbolic value, stated in writing, is no longer there."
"You know how important symbols are in politics as well."
"That means that you do not want to have this symbolic representation, either at the political or the Ombudsman level."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, maybe it was not understandable, but I shall make the question more simple."
"Ms Lunacek, in your country - I know you are from Austria - is there a Green Ombudsman?"
"In Hungary, there was a Green Ombudsman several years ago and there will be one, according to the new constitution."
"Is there a Green Ombudsman in your country?"
"Yes, or no?"
"Madam President, I must say to Mr Szájer: sorry, that is not the problem."
"Hungary had a Green ..."
"(Laughter)"
"OK, laugh if you want to."
"I do not mind laughter, I like humour, but the issue is that, with the new constitution in Hungary, this Green Ombudsman has been abolished and he has been subordinated."
"All the four Ombudsmen or Ombudswomen that existed have been subordinated to one general office of the Ombudsman."
"The issue of sustainability of future generations is not as visible as it was before and that is the criticism I have."
"My country does not have such a post."
"Of course, as a Green, I would fight for that, but you have written a new constitution and this abolishes a symbolic and a political value that I guess was important to you, as you say now."
"Why did you abolish it then?"
"Why did you not keep it there so that everybody could see a Green Ombudsman who is in favour of the rights of future generations, environment and sustainability?"
"You have not explained that, colleagues."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astounded by the instrumental tone of this debate."
"Thinking back also to the recent statements made by Mrs Lunacek, I will refrain from discussing, for example, the topic of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"In my country's constitution, there is no mention of this issue, and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution?"
"Moreover, it is rather strange because, in my country, the only party that wants to change the constitution is Mr Berlusconi's centre-right party."
"For 15 years, the response of the Left has been that we must not change the constitution or it will be the end of democracy."
"Be careful then because, when we open a debate on what a constitutional text does or does not contain, perhaps we should first of all clear up a misunderstanding."
"Do we really think that the fact that this constitution mentions the rights of the unborn child constitutes a risk for modernity?"
"Do we really think that the fact that the Christian roots of a country are mentioned in this constitution constitutes a risk for identity?"
"As far as I am concerned, I think we should all familiarise ourselves a little more with the text of the European constitution, which did not actually materialise but which had the motto 'United in diversity', and try to be a little more tolerant of the fact that everyone is different."
"In other words, we have to understand that at the moment, a broad consensus in Hungary has highlighted the needs of a people, and in order to avoid those needs turning into nationalism, it must be supported by a strong Europe that recognises everyone's rights and duties."
"(HU) Madam President, the Treaty on the European Union states that the European Union is based on respect for freedom, democracy, rule of law and human rights."
"These values are shared by the Member States."
"The Copenhagen Criteria are based on these values, which also form part of the accession conditions."
"The European institutions are also responsible for ensuring that Member States comply with these principles after accession, as well."
"Let me remind all of you of this responsibility and, in particular, the President of the Commission and the Commissioner who bear primary responsibility in this respect."
"Neither the contents of the new Hungarian constitution nor the circumstances of its drafting comply with these basic principles."
"Therefore, the questions related to this matter can be considered European, not national issues."
"One single party adopted this constitution, without public or professional consultations, and its draftsmen have dubious democratic legitimacy."
"The democratic opposition parties requested legal guarantees that the new constitution would be based on broad public consensus, and in the absence of this, they withdrew from the constitutional process."
"The two main tasks of the constitution are to ensure human rights and proper functioning of the state."
"However, the framework for the proper functioning of the state is problematic."
"According to the new constitution, amendments to the tax system, the pension system and family support system must be adopted by a two-thirds majority."
"This will impede the candidates of subsequent elections to promise changes concerning these matters, and will impede the voters in free election."
"Furthermore, the constitution invests the Budget Council, a body that is not elected directly, with the power of veto over the decisions of Parliament concerning the budget, which, in turn, may result in the dissolution of Parliament and a call for new elections, thereby threatening stable governance."
"The level of protection of human rights is decreased."
"Human rights will be enforced less effectively, as the competence of the constitutional court is limited."
"The most important acquis of the EU is that by its values, it has been able to channel conflicts which, in the past, could only be solved at the cost of considerable human suffering into a democratic framework based on the rule of law."
"The EU offers to and demands from its Member States a clear framework for the rule of law, constitutional guarantees, institutional checks and balances, and negotiated solutions."
"These values should be preserved."
"Madam President, in this House, we have discussed media freedom being under pressure in Italy, Slovakia and Hungary."
"We have discussed the violation of LGBT rights in Lithuania, Hungary, and Poland."
"We have discussed the expulsion of and discrimination against Roma people in France and Italy, and there have been many other examples of debates about fundamental rights being under pressure in one Member State or another."
"Every single time, I have heard the EPP say that this should not be party politics and that we should not single out Member States."
"This is not about Member States, this is about fundamental rights."
"Fundamental rights is not a matter of subsidiarity."
"Fundamental rights is about the very foundations of the European Union."
"In order to demonstrate this, I remind you that we ask candidate countries to adapt not only their laws but also their constitutions in order to be admitted as members of the European Union."
"Clearly, colleagues, there are objective concerns that have been expressed not only by political parties but also by the Venice Commission, and, at the very least, there are ambiguities."
"Instead of having this very acrimonious debate, we should try and clarify the issues."
"One last practical suggestion to the Hungarian Government."
"If you want to demonstrate your very strong commitment to the protection and promotion of LGBT rights, I would invite you to walk with Budapest Gay Pride on 18 June."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental human rights are universal, which means that they are applicable in every situation."
"I have been listening to the debate."
"None of the speakers so far, including the critics, has quoted the constitution to indicate exactly what it is they do not like."
"Mr López Aguilar says that he gets the impression that something has gone awry, while others are making insinuations about all the things that could go wrong with this constitution."
"Not one person has actually quoted from the constitution itself."
"That is precisely the problem that faces us in this discussion: where are the actual accusations?"
"When I consider how the Hungarians will react to this debate and to the accusations being bandied about by some of my fellow Members without any support from direct quotations, then I can well imagine that some will find the way that the Hungarians and their country's development are being discussed here to be extremely arrogant."
"As Europeans, we should take care to avoid leaving ourselves open to such accusations."
"I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty."
"It is simply unacceptable that accusations should be continuously made against these people and that the impression should be created that they are experiencing problems with freedom."
"This has nothing to do with party politics; it is simply a fact."
"Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: 'We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation'."
"I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution."
"This may not please all Members of this House."
"I am pleased that this reference to Christianity has been included and I would also have liked to have seen it included in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the European constitution."
"My position, as a representative of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is that this is a good thing."
"Madam President, we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament."
"European values are being questioned in the new Hungarian constitution."
"Therefore, we have to discuss it and have to do so now."
"There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws."
"I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced, close to the citizens, based on generally accepted values and principles, and should be party neutral."
"Sadly, the Hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria."
"Even the adoption of the document is questionable."
"There was no, or very little, social consultation."
"The text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts."
"The new constitution raises questions on an international level."
"For example, there is a lack of reference to EU law in the closing provisions."
"We note clear differences, and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles."
"The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either."
"The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming, modern, administrative structure."
"The aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous."
"They make governing the country almost impossible for any future government."
"We have the impression, as one of our colleagues has put it, that the government is like a football team trying to change the rules and the referee during a game."
"This is not the way to treat political opponents and this is certainly not how democracy works in the 21st century in Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, I have a lot of sympathy with the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in other areas."
"We work closely together on economic issues."
"However, in this particular case, we must make it clear that we should not play party politics here."
"Above all, we must emphasise that it is scandalous to criticise the constitution of a Member State in this forum, whichever Member State that may be."
"There are Member States, and here I am looking at Mr Busuttil, among others, since he brought up the issue so forcefully, who seek the support of the European Union when they experience problems; it is an expression of European solidarity that we should provide help when, for example, Malta experiences a problem with refugees."
"However, solidarity must be based on shared values, and all of the groups within this House are responsible for sustaining such values."
"Although the Charter of Fundamental Rights may only be binding on European legislation and its implementation, Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the Treaties are binding on all Member States."
"A two-thirds majority was cemented into the Hungarian constitution, so that, realistically speaking, any future Hungarian Government will be unable to amend any of the country's laws."
"This goes against the principle of parliamentary democracy."
"This limiting of the powers of the constitutional court is something quite unique and threatens the principle of the separation of powers."
"We cannot discount the possibility that there is a breach of international law in relation to criminal proceedings."
"There is so much I could say, but I certainly wish to state the following: it is not just the right of the EU and the European Commission to make their voice heard in this case; it is also their duty."
"In the past - even long before the European Union existed - Europe too often held back on criticising abuses in Member States."
"My country, along with others, has experience of this."
"When the politicians remain silent, sooner or later the people will make themselves heard and then we need to ask ourselves whether it is too late and whether we have failed."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mr Alvaro, this is true, just one sentence."
"We agree."
"This criticism is shameful."
"My question is this: on what grounds do you base your opinion that a fundamental law adopted by a two-thirds majority cannot be changed in a democratic country?"
"It could be changed so far."
"It can be changed in other countries as well."
"Please be specific."
"Which exactly are the common values, common European values, that the Hungarian constitution excludes, rejects, or comes into conflict with?"
"Because what you are saying is too general."
"(DE) Madam President, many thanks for your question."
"I accept the criticism that I have dealt in generalities in the minute's speaking time allocated to me."
"However, I can provide more concrete examples."
"European values are one thing; however, European values also mean, for example, that a Member State should operate on the rule of law, which entails issues such as the separation of powers and the democratic principle."
"When, for example, a constitutional court has no jurisdiction in budgetary and taxation matters, this constitutes a restriction in the separation of powers and is unquestionably a dubious situation."
"Accordingly, I believe that we can discuss such issues."
"With regard to the other questions, such as the two-thirds majority, I must ask to what extent this is compatible with parliamentary democracy if future governments no longer have any room to manoeuvre."
"It is certainly open to question whether life imprisonment without any right of appeal or judicial review by the supreme court is compatible with the principles of democracy and the rule of law upheld in the European Union."
"These are questions that need answers and I believe that the Commission must investigate."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mr Alvaro, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the Hungarian constitution previously in force specified 27 laws that could only be modified by a two-thirds majority, while the new constitution specifies only 26."
"What is the problem here?"
"A recent scholarly analysis came up with this number; it is not my own calculation."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that people will forgive me if I answer a question based on a subjective opinion with a subjective opinion of my own."
"No, I do not think it is the most modern."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Alvaro, you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions."
"However, I would like to ask you whether you are aware that the provisions for the Hungarian constitutional court - I am not sure whether you have read the Hungarian constitution in its entirety - are almost identical to those that apply to the constitutional court in Germany."
"Therefore, I wanted to ask you whether the German constitutional court is just as undemocratic and worthy of criticism as the Hungarian constitutional court?"
"I would like to hear your answer to this question."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Weber, as you have just stated that it is only identical in certain sections, it is quite clear that there are also sections where it may be open to question whether the fact that the Hungarian constitution circumscribes the jurisdiction of the constitutional court in tax and budgetary issues is compatible with the principle of the separation of powers."
"If you were now to tell me that the German constitutional court could not decide on tax issues, for example, following a judgment by the German Federal Court of Justice, or if budget law could not be examined by the German constitutional court for example, by way of a constitutional dispute between government institutions, such as a party in the German Bundestag, then I would agree with you."
"However, the German constitution does permit this, while also allowing a case to be taken to the German constitutional court in such questions."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would like to refer to something that was mentioned before; the rights of future generations."
"It looks very unique in the Hungarian constitution, something that is being enshrined in the Hungarian constitution, and recognised seemingly also here."
"This raises a question I would like to ask about the basic right of those eventual members of future generations - to be born."
"Is caring about future human beings a European value - or not?"
"Maybe not European, only Hungarian?"
"Then Europe should look to Hungary with gratitude for reminding it of some fundamentals."
"(DE) Madam President, I hold Mr Landsbergis in high esteem."
"However, I am unable to find a question in his speech."
"If this was not a question, then I will use the time to make a statement."
"As far as I am aware, no constitution defines the law for future generations."
"That is not the issue at stake."
"What we are dealing with is human dignity - this is a principle found in the German constitution, as well as others - and the Hungarian constitution is no different in this regard."
"I cannot see a contradiction here."
"The question is whether this is to be restricted or defined in future."
"However, as I said before, I failed to understand your question completely."
"Sustainability, the protection of future generations, the desire for a healthy natural environment and the protection of quality of life - all of these are principles that, if I am not mistaken, can be found in the constitutions of all Member States, and that have been upheld in many supreme court judgments."
"I believe that this principle was never questioned by you, even during your time as President."
"(HU) Madam President, I would like to reassure my fellow Members and Mr Alvaro that Hungary is a state where the rule of law still prevails."
"I would like to reassure Mrs in 't Veld, Mrs Göncz and Mrs Benova that Hungary still respects fundamental rights, human rights and the values of the Union."
"Hungarian laws and the constitution adopted in April comply with the laws and basic values of the European Union."
"Hungary is maintaining all her international legal obligations and commitments and, in fact, this is clearly stated in the text of the constitution, and if it were not the case, then the Commission would take it to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge it in a formal procedure; but we all know in this Chamber that this is not the case."
"Fellow Members, the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty."
"In a democracy based on popular representation, it is up to the MPs elected in free elections to decide which areas should be dealt with at a constitutional level, and which areas should be dealt with at a general legislative level."
"What I do not understand about this debate is that up until now, we have been taught that laws that can be modified by a two-thirds majority are there to provide a guarantee that they cannot be abused."
"We need a two-thirds majority constitution because this is a rule that provides guarantees."
"Now we hear that many raise objections against the very two-thirds majority that they had previously seen as a guarantee."
"I personally feel that you are incapable of accepting the rules of the game of democracy."
"In addition, as my colleagues have already pointed out, the new Hungarian constitution refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a new constitutional element, and considers the minorities of Hungary as an integral part of the Hungarian political community."
"The Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations said that it elevates environmental protection and responsibility for future generations to an outstanding level."
"The way we speak about this constitution, we could be talking about any other European constitution."
"You always talk about difference, and emphasise that if something reflects a different value, it does not mean that it is better or worse."
"It is simply different, and as a Hungarian, I would be grateful if you could respect this in the spirit of unity in diversity."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(SK) Madam President, today I received an invitation to the exhibition 'Bridges Between Nations', an event organised by your colleague."
"In this invitation, he used the motto of the founder of the EU, Jean Monnet, who said that the Union was built by people."
"Mrs Gál, constitutions and bridges must also be built by people."
"I would like to ask you why the coalition in Hungary does not want the opposition to participate in the process of drawing up the constitution."
"(HU) The opposition had the opportunity to participate in the work of Parliament."
"The opposition decided not to participate in this work and we respect their decision."
"Instead, as we can see, they wish to carry out a debate here, which is something that the Hungarian public does not really understand."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, no, in fact this is basically quite simple."
"Having heard from others that other Member States should put their own house in order and examine their constitutions, perhaps Mrs Gál could quote an article from the constitution of one of the Member States of the European Union that she would categorise as an example of an area where a state needs to 'put its own house in order'."
"After all, it was Mrs Gál who explicitly stated that that is what other Member States should do."
"In other words, where is the specific criticism of the constitution of another Member State that needs to be addressed?"
"Once we have this information, we can, of course, get down to discussions."
"(HU) It is not stated at a constitutional level that everyone should set their own houses in order."
"Mr Alvaro, I said to you as well, as a Liberal MEP, that those who respect and emphasise the right to being different in all areas should be prepared to accept that being different can appear in the spirit, in the choice of values and the structures of the constitutions."
"This is what I wanted to say."
"This does not mean that we do not respect the basic values of the EU, or we do not comply fully with the requirements set out in European law or international law."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mrs Gál, I would like to give an answer as to why the previous rule stating that amendments to the constitution could only be accepted with the support of a four-fifths majority of MPs had to be changed."
"This rule, which had been accepted by a parliamentary majority that obtained 72% of the votes between 1994 and 1998 to protect the rights of political minorities and the opposition, was abolished by Fidesz."
"What was the reason for this?"
"The opposition did not participate in the work in the absence of this guarantee; it was not a case of being deprived of this right, as this rule had been changed."
"Commissioner Reding, I would like to draw your attention to this."
"(HU) Mr Tabajdi, I have not been a Member of the Hungarian Parliament since 1990, but my colleagues, who were Members, or even party group leaders and speakers of the House at the time, claim that there was no such rule in force."
"This is not true."
"I think you should carry out this debate in the Hungarian Parliament; this is completely outside the scope of the debates in the European Parliament."
"(SK) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new Hungarian constitution really is perhaps the most reactionary constitution in Europe."
"That is one side of the issue, but the other side is that it is also dangerous on an international level."
"Some honourable Members here have said that this is a sovereign matter for Hungary."
"That is true, but this constitution violates the sovereignty of other states."
"Commissioner, this is a matter of the utmost importance."
"It undermines the peace settlement of Europe."
"It undermines borders between states."
"It openly takes advantage of minorities in neighbouring countries for extreme nationalist ends."
"It is saturated with the spirit of Greater Hungary."
"In the context of granting citizenship on a purely ethnic basis, regardless of residence, employment or family ties, it opens a Pandora's Box of extreme nationalism such as we have not seen since the end of the Second World War."
"That is not all."
"It makes it possible to grant voting rights to Hungarians permanently living in neighbouring countries."
"Can you imagine Hungarian political parties mounting an election campaign in another country?"
"In short, the new Hungarian constitution will lead to the total destabilisation of Central Europe."
"It brings the spirit of the Balkan wars to Central Europe."
"The Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, László Kövér, recently said in connection with the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros dam that military intervention was required from the Hungarian side, and that the Paris Peace Treaties did not apply to Slovakia, and he also questioned Slovakia's borders in the context of the spirit of this constitution."
"I think it is time for both the European Union and European Parliament to declare a decisive 'no' to this dangerous nationalistic policy, while there is still time."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a fascinating debate, and yet I should like to say, perhaps rather bluntly, that we should not confuse the issue."
"This afternoon, I have the impression that we are moving away somewhat from political hypocrisy because it is not a question of criticising the constitution of a Member State of the European Union such as Hungary which, of course, is in sole charge, with its people, of its sovereignty."
"However, in this Parliament, it is a question, and in my case, a concern which relates to the EU legal system, and consequently an issue that affects the degree to which we share our common values, and to which we share how Europe has been built, by States and by the fundamental texts of the Member States and other national founding texts."
"However, there are contradictions concerning non-discrimination, the respect for minorities, problems of pluralism, and concerning opposition, which appear to be challenged."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, if everything is straightforward, as some of the speakers here this afternoon appear to be saying, let the executive college ascertain whether the Hungarian text is compatible and legally compliant with the foundations of our EU platform, and things will be clear."
"The credibility of the EU legal system, and consequently of the European Union, depends on it."
"Madam President, this is a passionate, exhilarating if somewhat controversial debate, but nevertheless, I am certainly enjoying this expression of democracy."
"It has to be said that we are entitled to discuss this matter because Hungary is part of the European Union."
"But Hungary is also entitled to have a constitution and certainly this is far better than the old constitution of 1949 brought in by the Communists."
"It is a genuine effort to reflect modern values within the European context."
"While people will argue with some elements of it, it has to be stated that a constitution can always be amended by way of referendum and, if we find at European Union level that some aspects of it are not in keeping with European law and values, that can be done and taken on board."
"It has to be said as well that this constitution was passed on 18 April with 262 votes for and 44 against and that is an expression of democracy."
"People have objected to some aspects of it, for instance, to the references to Christianity and to God, but this is nothing new."
"These are found in the German, Polish and Irish constitutions."
"As a Christian-Democrat, I am absolutely delighted that there is a reference to God and Christianity, because it is a fundamental part of our culture and our history and I think it is far better to have it included than excluded and creating a godless society."
"People have also objected to granting citizenship to people outside of Hungary, but in Ireland, we have had passport facility for people who are officially living in Northern Ireland, which is in the United Kingdom."
"This has helped the situation more than it has detracted from it and we now have a better relationship with the United Kingdom than ever before, expressed by the visit of Queen Elizabeth two weeks ago."
"People have objected to the definition of marriage, the definition of life and so forth but, as I have said, if there are flaws, they can be addressed in a referendum."
"Finally, they are to be commended for including a limit to the extent of state debt, which is very important."
"If we had had that in our constitution in Ireland, we might not be in the mess we are now financially."
"So there is an awful lot of good in it and I think that if we are thinking of having a new constitution, we can learn a lot from what Hungary has done."
"Madam President, there are a number of problems with this constitution, but I want to focus on one key issue, which is that the proposed constitution does not give any protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"The only type of marriage that would be recognised would be one between a man and a woman."
"We have had a long fight across Europe for LGBT rights, and we cannot allow Hungary to take this retrograde step."
"Gay rights are protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Not only that, but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around Europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are."
"Yes, it is for Hungary to decide the Hungarian constitution."
"However, each Member State has the responsibility to respect the European Community that they are part of."
"The protection of LGBT people is fundamental to the European Union, and Hungary cannot disregard that."
"(SK) Madam President, today's Europe is based on values that unite us and that enable us to cooperate and respect one another."
"I would also like to emphasise that every state has the right to adopt its own constitution through democratically elected representatives."
"The new Hungarian constitution, however, opens up issues that are sensitive for its neighbours and which affect them."
"I am talking, for example, about Article 23."
"This foresees the possibility of members of the Hungarian minority in neighbouring states acquiring the right to vote, on condition that they obtain Hungarian citizenship."
"It is here that the problem lies."
"The unusual criteria established for acquiring Hungarian citizenship, in other words, without a natural link to Hungary, creates the possibility of political links coming into existence between a state and citizens who have no real link to that state."
"I also see problems in the formulation of Section D. There is talk here of a single Hungarian nation, of collective rights, of support for their self-rule in other countries on the principle of ethnicity, on the responsibility of Hungary for all Hungarians."
"Thus, in paragraph 4, there is room for possible extra-territorial impacts of this constitution."
"The Slovak Government is striving for a peaceful, businesslike discussion of these issues on a bilateral level."
"It meets with rejection, however, from Hungary."
"Since the constitution has not yet come into force, I therefore think that this is the right time to discuss it and to explain what the negative impacts might be."
"I would like to say one more thing."
"In our current policy on EU expansion, we are trying to emphasise the settling of neighbourly relations between the future states on the basis of our European values."
"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine what the reaction of the Union would be if Serbia, for example, decided today to grant citizenship en masse to citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or if Albania granted citizenship to citizens of Macedonia."
"I would like to say one more time that only in a situation where there is mutual respect for values and cooperation can we talk about continuing the joint development of the European Union in the future."
"(HU) Madam President, I have asked for the floor three times already and I am glad you managed to give me the floor upon my third request."
"First, I would like to make a correction."
"There was a question about whether the constitution contained that particular fourth-fifths majority or not."
"It was included in the Standing Orders of Parliament, but it was abolished at the proposal of Fidesz."
"What I would like to ask Mr Kukan is that when Mr Markert was here from the Venice Commission and the two-thirds majority was mentioned - which keeps coming up here as well - he confirmed that the two-thirds majority does exist."
"In such cases, self-restraint would be a fundamental expectation, but he can see no sign of it."
"So my question to Mr Kukan is whether he has already discussed with the Fidesz members sitting in the European Parliament the issues he has raised."
"Does he see any signs of willingness to make changes to these points in the constitution?"
"Madam President, is the question for me?"
"My sincere answer is: I cannot answer your question."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new Hungarian constitution drafted by the Orbán government is not lacking in rather striking articles, as my fellow Members have pointed out."
"The chapter on private life appears to be the high point of a constitution that is based, as we have noted, exclusively on Christian religious references and traditional family values."
"It would appear that this text also allows the right to abortion in Hungary to be restricted by stating, and I quote, 'that the life of the foetus will be protected from the time of conception'."
"The Hungarian Government has backed up its words by action in this area by launching an anti-abortion communication campaign which would still, apparently, appear to be using funds from the European PROGRESS programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity)."
"At a time when the European Union is holding up progress and gender equality as common fundamental values, it is somewhat surprising that these European funds should be involved in a campaign of this nature. I should therefore like to take the opportunity of this debate to question the Commission on the validation of the funding for this campaign by the PROGRESS programme."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mrs Guillaume, I would like to ask you a question."
"In your opinion, how have the regulations concerning the concept of abortion and the rules pertaining to abortion in the new constitution changed compared with the previous constitution?"
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to encourage a response from the Commission about the programme in question."
"I have already put the question to the Commission, and I am awaiting a response to learn whether it has indeed been verified that these funds have indeed been used for this campaign."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to draw your attention in particular to the provisions of the revised constitution relating to the collective rights of the ethnic Hungarian minority living abroad and to the explicit declaration, in this case, of the principle of extraterritoriality, both of which blatantly breach OSCE standards and the repeated assessments made by the Venice Commission in similar cases."
"I am referring to Article d for Mr Weber's benefit."
"This is unacceptable and I should remind you that it is already having an impact."
"Last week, Mr Tőkés, Vice-President of the European Parliament, hosted the official inauguration of an office representing the Székely Region, which does not exist in Romania, in the Hungarian House of Regions."
"I strongly believe, Commissioner, that the Venice Commission's report will confirm that these breaches have taken place."
"I would ask you the following then: what will the European Commission want and be able to do about this?"
"Finally, I want to ask the following question, especially to the German and French MEPs among you, here in Strasbourg, which is the symbol of the historical reconciliation between Germany and France, and which our European Union has been built on: can you allow the demons of nationalism to be let loose in Europe without destroying our European Union project?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mr Boştinaru, I have two questions that I would like to ask: do Romanian laws allow the granting of citizenship to individuals of Romanian nationality even if they do not live in the territory of Romania?"
"This is my first question."
"My second question is this: is there a law that stipulates that those Romanian citizens who do not live in the territory of Romania can take part in the elections to the National Assembly and the Senate?"
"(RO) Fellow Member, I would like to remind you that I referred solely to European standards and principles which are universally recognised and not to any legal or constitutional provisions in Romania."
"However, I would also like to answer you by saying that there is no legal act in Romania which stipulates the principle of extraterritoriality and collective rights."
"I referred to this when I mentioned the dispute with the European Commission's assessments."
"When an infringement of these values is noted in any EU Member State, it is the European Union's task to give a robust response, no matter what that state is called."
"This is my answer."
"(IT) Madam President, the new Hungarian constitution limits the possibility of intervention by supervisory bodies such as the constitutional court, and increases the powers of the executive, thereby bringing into question the normal system of checks and balances."
"Social rights have been negated, the state only providing subsidies to the needy if they agree to do community work."
"Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence."
"The right to abortion has been banned and highly discriminatory laws against homosexuals have been introduced."
"All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"(NL) Madam President, I am happy to see Commissioner Reding attending this debate on how best to defend European values ​​of democracy."
"We felt her absence during the previous debates on the Hungarian media law, when the same values were at stake."
"As for the constitution, every nation has the right to elect representatives to its own government."
"The government has a responsibility to stand up for the interests of its people, all of its people."
"In the case of Hungary, the majority party, Fidesz, is making the decisions about the content of a new constitution."
"By amending the constitution in that way, without really involving other parties or civil society organisations, it is undermining the democratic process, killing off dynamism and threatening to impose the exclusive right of a single party."
"The majority at the expense of the minority."
"A true democracy is tested and judged on how that country treats its minorities."
"One minority, in particular, the LGBT community, will be especially affected by a constitution which, in the 21st century, is harking back to antiquated ways of life."
"This is going back in time, not moving with the times."
"We expect better of our EU Presidency."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for taking the floor so many times, but I was personally involved in the drafting of this constitution, and I find it greatly disturbing to hear misapprehensions, whether deliberate, or unintentional."
"This is exactly why I would like to ask Mrs Bozkurt the following, after she claimed that there was no consultation on this issue: Did you know that 917 000 Hungarian citizens returned the 12-question questionnaire through which Hungary and the Hungarian Government consulted with its citizens about the important issues in the constitution?"
"Directly with the Hungarian citizens; in fact, 10% of the entire population took part in the consultation."
"Do you happen to know any European constitution that was preceded by consultations on such a wide scale?"
"(NL) Madam President, these things are constantly being played down."
"However, can you explain why there has been so much protest here, why members from all kinds of groups are saying that this is wrong?"
"Why are we having this debate then?"
"I do not think that we would be having this debate if everything had gone well."
"Can you indicate what the party affiliation of the people who sent those 17 000 forms was?"
"Who did you pass them on to?"
"I would like to hear some answers from you about that."
"(HU) Madam President, Mrs Bozkurt, to answer your question, everyone received this letter in which they could express their opinions."
"Thank you for this opportunity for a debate, because this way I can tell you what an immense pleasure the birth of the Hungarian constitution has given me."
"It is a painful fact that the 20 years that have elapsed since the fall of communism were not enough to create a new constitution."
"We have brought this transitional era to a close now and established a new constitution based on national consensus."
"Our new constitution is the collection of our shared values; it starts with our most beautiful national prayer which also emphasises the importance of our common European values, and it finally places the appreciation of our Christian roots and family - our key values - where it belongs."
"It is more than reassuring that in the new constitution, the Hungarian state takes responsibility for its citizens both within and outside its borders, does not allow state debt to run out of control, and, among other things, it declares parents' responsibility for their children."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to take the floor at the end of the debate, because sadly, I have to say that at the end of the day, I have not heard any specific criticisms from you."
"Secondly, we, MEPs, cannot have a say in a matter of national competence."
"However, now that I was given the floor, I would rather not criticise, but make a recommendation on behalf of 80 million people living with disabilities."
"The Hungarian constitution is the only European constitution that includes special provisions and assistance for people with disabilities."
"So I would suggest you include similar provisions in your respective countries' constitution."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(SK) Madam President, the unprecedented declaration by the second highest representative of the Hungarian Republic, the Speaker of Parliament, Mr Kövér, who has called the Paris Treaty and the borders into question, only confirms the level of revisionism being applied under the Hungarian policy."
"It is unfortunate that the government of Iveta Radičová in Slovakia, under the pretext of non-confrontationalism, is concealing its own inability to respond to dual citizenship, to the constitution of the Hungarian Republic, to voting rights for Hungarians living in neighbouring countries and to the statements of the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament."
"I am concerned about the ineptitude of our government, but the silence of the European institutions is also striking, as if they did not want to see this violation of European law by the country holding the Presidency."
"I hope that the representatives of the European institutions will listen carefully and monitor the situation in Hungary, and that they will make an uncompromising statement very soon on the undermining of the borders and the Paris Peace Treaty, and on a Hungarian constitution which enshrines support for the collective rights of Hungarian minorities and the creation of collective self-governing areas."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner Reding, I am addressing you."
"It is obvious that the Hungarian constitution in itself would not have generated such a wide European debate, but unfortunately, Hungary is back on the agenda again after six months, when we looked at the media law."
"In fact, it is not the constitution itself, but the anti-democratic practices that have taken root in Hungary: judges, policemen, and people paying into private pension funds are deprived of their acquired rights."
"Commissioner, what is the underlying reason for divesting the constitutional court and the ombudsmen of their acquired rights?"
"They are threatening the independence of the courts; they have already snatched the independence of the media."
"These are all extremely important and extremely dangerous elements."
"Commissioner, I would like to hand over to you the 30-page criticism of the Venice Commission."
"This body formulated extremely serious criticisms and I really hope that the European Commission and you in particular, will finally take its duty seriously, because you should be the guardian of the European Treaties."
"Please, do your job!"
"(SL) Madam President, the Hungarian Presidency surprised us at the very beginning with an unusual gift, a map of Greater Hungary, a map of a dream which can obviously only become a reality in a united, democratic Europe, and which does not invoke the past."
"Today's debate is evidence that nationalism, and excessive nationalism at that, is one of the causes of division."
"In the region that I come from, we have had a great many problems in recent decades because of nationalism."
"I ask the Hungarian members of Parliament and the representatives of Hungarian authorities to abandon nationalistic games and playing around with peace treaties which remain unrealised and which they perceive as unjust."
"Otherwise, the Treaty of Trianon will come to represent for all of us something that is not good."
"Madam President, I would just like to ask for a little clarification from colleagues on that side of the House, because in the debate, you have firmly insisted on the right of every Member State to pass laws as it deems fit, as long as it has a democratic majority, and that those laws should be recognised by other countries."
"Could I perhaps ask Mr Szájer to reply, on behalf of the EPP Group, whether that means that, from now on, Hungary and the other countries represented will also recognise the Dutch marriage law that allows same-sex couples to get married?"
"(PL) Madam President, this debate reminds me of another debate, held several months ago, on the media laws in Hungary."
"Both that debate and this one are merely a pretext for attacking Hungary."
"European political correctness cannot bear the fact that there is a country in which conservatism is triumphing, that there is a country in Europe where national interests are being effectively protected, and that there is a country in Europe which is returning to real values."
"This is an attack on the Hungarian Government for having successfully rescued the country after half a century of bankrupt Communist governments and their political offspring."
"Now it is the turn of the constitution."
"While European political correctness is forcefully dissociating itself from its Christian roots, the Hungarians have dared to take pride in enshrining them in their constitution."
"While Brussels is promoting cosmopolitanism, Budapest is emphasising its heroic national past."
"Hungarians are focusing on national identity, their own state and common sense."
"The world is finally back to rights."
"Communism is described as a tyrant, and marriage is at last a union between a woman and a man."
"I hope that future generations of Hungarians will be proud of this fine constitution."
"(HU) Madam President, in today's debate, it seems that the Venice Commission has become a kind of European super Supreme Court."
"The same Venice Commission formulated serious criticisms, justified criticisms against the Slovak language law that is still in force, and I have not heard any of my fellow Slovak Members ever refer to that language law."
"My fellow Member, Mr Boştinaru is not in the Chamber anymore, so he cannot reply, but I would like to answer Mr Szájer that I, as a Romanian citizen, do know that Romanian citizens living outside the territory of Romania can vote and can have passports, and, similarly to the Slovak constitution, many European constitutions lay down the rights of their citizens living outside their borders."
"I do not see anything objectionable in this. What I would rather contemplate is why Hungary feels the need to include this in the constitution - it is because Hungarians living outside the borders are still discriminated in countries where the Hungarian constitution is vehemently criticised."
"Madam President, I think I put a very concrete and clear question to Mr Szájer."
"I hope he would like to reply."
"We are using the catch-the-eye procedure, so the blue-card procedure is not permitted."
"(HU) Madam President, as a Slovakian citizen, I would like to express my opinion on what is happening here today."
"I belong to those who were not given mass Hungarian citizenship, because this will be granted to those who lodged their application individually."
"The reason why I asked to take the floor is the belligerent tone that some colleagues have adopted."
"I am extremely worried about the fact that the Hungarian constitution is assessed as if it were an attack against peaceful cohabitation in Europe."
"I feel that because of completely misinterpreted or poorly translated texts - for example, the right to vote, which is not included in the constitution - we are having these speeches made in an extremely bad mood and striking a very belligerent tone, which are not appropriate in the European Parliament."
"(HU) Madam President, the Socialist initiative can be described as having three main characteristics: it breaks the law, it is cowardly, and bears the characteristics of show trials."
"It breaks the law because the European Parliament has no licence or competence whatsoever to examine the Hungarian constitution."
"It is clear from the letter of Mr Barroso and the statement of Mrs Reding that this is within national sovereignty."
"It is cowardly because if the Socialists had found anything to contest, they would have turned to the European Court in Luxembourg and would not be debating here."
"They have not done so, because they know exactly that they would lose the Court case."
"And finally, both the procedure and the initiative bear the characteristics of show trials because there is only one thing in the background: Fidesz winning the elections by a two-thirds majority last year."
"The Socialists - apparently not only the Hungarian, but also the European Socialists - have not been able to swallow the decision of the Hungarian citizens, so they take every opportunity to attack the Hungarian Government."
"(PL) Madam President, it has to be said that the hypocrisy and double standards in this debate and in the criticism of the Hungarian constitution are striking."
"On the one hand, accusations have been levelled at the constitution because it does not refer to God and Christianity, and because it offers no protection for what are known as homosexual marriages."
"Yet such accusations could easily be made regarding a great many European constitutions, including the Polish constitution, for example, which also contains such provisions, or does not contain them in the latter case."
"This is exactly as it should be, for this is a domestic matter for Poland to deal with, as laid down in the EU Treaty."
"We should not violate our own Treaty on European Union."
"The drafting of the constitution has been accused of being undemocratic, yet people are ignoring the fact that the vast majority of Hungarians supported this constitution."
"This hypocrisy is also apparent from the way in which those protesting so loudly today against Hungary and its Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, were silent when the previous socialist government in Hungary in practice brought its country to the brink of bankruptcy, using force to silence the opposition when it protested at democratic rallies and gatherings."
"This is not a matter in which we should get involved."
"(HU) Mr János Áder, just a ten-second correction of what you have just said."
"The European Court of Human Rights is not in Luxembourg."
"It is located in Strasbourg."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mrs Reding, I fail to see the point of this debate."
"I would have framed some of the points in the Hungarian constitution differently."
"There are also some points in my own German constitution that I do not fully agree with, likewise the French constitution."
"However, this has nothing to do with this House, because it is not responsible for such issues."
"That is the crucial point."
"That is, unless is it specifically established that some provision is in breach of European law."
"If someone does not like a particular element in a national constitution, this has nothing to do with this House, because this is a matter of national identity and jurisdiction."
"Just as the Commission forced changes in Hungary's media laws because some points were unacceptable, so it or the European Court of Justice will take action if laws are passed when implementing the constitution that breach European law."
"It is even possible to take a case to the European Court of Justice."
"It is for this reason that I believe what we are witnessing here is a bit of political theatre."
"We do not have the right to interfere with the Hungarian constitution."
"Perhaps I would have done certain things differently, but it is Hungary's right to do things as it sees fit."
"(HU) Madam President, we have witnessed an unprecedented event here, in the European Parliament."
"The constitution of a Member State, one of the most important components of national sovereignty, has been attacked here by certain MEPs."
"You had better be aware that those who have blatantly infringed national sovereignty not only cause damage to Hungary, but to all of Europe."
"This case established a precedent that weakens genuine supporters of Europe and strengthens Eurosceptics."
"This is irresponsible behaviour."
"At the same time, what we have heard from the Commission is reassuring."
"It seemed to be self-evident, yet I am happy that the point was made at this plenary session."
"The European Commission has no intentions or right to interfere with the constitutional affairs of Member States."
"After all this, it is high time the left wing stops its provocative political campaign based on misrepresentations against the Hungarian Government."
"The new Hungarian constitution is an important instrument for clearing away the ruins left by eight years of corrupt and inept Socialist governance."
"Fidesz was given a two-thirds majority mandate to do this job."
"The left wing simply has to accept that this decision cannot be changed either in Brussels, or in Strasbourg."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Brok, I found your remarks somewhat irritating, which is why I asked to speak."
"Naturally, the European Union has competences that enable it to establish the compatibility of national law with European law."
"As you said yourself, anything that breaches the European Treaties can also be clarified in a court of law."
"So, why should this House be prevented from debating such a situation?"
"Is it not, in fact, absolutely necessary for this House to debate this issue?"
"I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies."
"If we live in a European democracy, then of course, the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed."
"These include, for example, the Convention on Human Rights, as well as the Treaties of the European Union, and I believe that we should be able to debate this issue in this Chamber."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I had asked to have a clear line from the European Parliament."
"Well, there was no clear line from the European Parliament."
"I heard a lot of diverging opinions, which in itself shows how complex this matter is."
"So let me underline once more that the Commission respects the Lisbon Treaty and does not intervene in the sovereignty of nation states."
"On behalf of President Barroso, I would like to underline once more that the Commission does not make political judgments on the fundamental constitutional and institutional choices that a Member State makes."
"The adoption of a new constitution in a Member State is a matter for its people and for its institutions."
"As I have already underlined, we could become competent when the constitution is translated into legislative, administrative or judicial practice."
"I can assure Parliament that we would not hesitate for a moment to intervene in such a case if the Treaty or the Charter was violated or if Union law was not respected."
"Turning to Ms Guillaume's question on Union law: when Union law is at stake, I have never shied away from action."
"The question raised by Ms Guillaume concerns an awareness-raising campaign on the work-life balance, which was supported by the Progress programme."
"This is part of the campaign consisting of promotion material showing a foetus with the words 'Let me live', with the Commission's logo."
"I made it very clear: this campaign is not in line with the Progress programme and it is not in line with the project proposal submitted to the Commission services by the Hungarian authorities."
"Therefore, the Commission asked for this part of the campaign to be stopped without further delay and for all existing posters to be removed."
"If this is not done, we will start procedures to terminate the ground agreement and draw necessary consequences, including financial ones."
"That is how we answer when European law is at stake."
"Constitutions are not within our competence."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank this House for the particular attention it has paid to my government's activities in the last semester."
"The Hungarian Presidency is strongly convinced that the newly adopted - not revised - Hungarian constitution is fully in line with the basic values and principles on which the Union is founded."
"Since the beginning of our Presidency, we have dedicated all our energy and have been tireless in our efforts in promoting the common European agenda."
"I am especially pleased that not even the critics, who were mentioned during today's debate, have questioned the firmness and the sincerity of my government's commitment."
"Madam President, on a point of order - and I tried to make this point halfway through the debate, but you cut me off - I would suggest that you look back over this debate and see how you allocated blue card questions and catch-the-eye requests."
"I can sum it up: two blue card requests from me were ignored, while requests were approved from Mr Alvaro (twice), from Ms Göncz (three times) and from Mr Tavares (once)."
"You were unable to genuinely balance the way these were distributed."
"I would ask you to take a look at this next time so as to achieve a balance."
"I assure you, Mrs Sargentini, we have gone over the allotted time of 45 minutes."
"All the Members have had an opportunity to speak."
"I allowed them to speak for at least 15 seconds and even a minute in some cases, and the balance between the political groups has been fully respected."
"However, you are entitled to check and, of course, to make a complaint."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Hungarian constitution was adopted on 18 April using a process which has pushed democracy to its limits."
"It will come into force early next year."
"Although we do not have the necessary powers to dictate to one Member State what the content of its fundamental law should be, we cannot act with indifference to this anti-democratic abuse."
"This is a case which must sound a warning bell for all Member States and governments, regardless of their political persuasion."
"What is even more serious is that the Hungarian Government is using the EU Presidency not to contribute to the construction of a united Europe, but to support the resurgence of a nationalism which we thought had been forgotten."
"As far as states like Romania and Slovakia are concerned, the content of the constitution may create a framework conducive to dangerous situations, based on collective rights for ethnic Hungarians and the principle of extraterritoriality."
"Furthermore, the Hungarian Government has shown its support for setting up an office for the Székely Region in Brussels, which is a major affront to Romanians and Romania's territorial integrity."
"I believe that the European Parliament has the right to discuss the legislative solutions enshrined in the constitutions of its Member States."
"We live in one Europe, and the citizens of our countries have a right to live in any Member State without any barriers."
"However, we must remember that the European nations have a sovereign right to enact fundamental laws."
"Different countries and different nationalities have been shaped by different experiences."
"Hungarians also have the right to adopt a constitution which makes no mention of an ombudsman or a personal data representative."
"When I hear MEPs talking about the Hungarian Parliament violating fundamental European principles, I cannot help but feel that I do not share the principles to which you refer."
"Most of all, I would like to congratulate Hungary on its new constitution."
"The fact that the overwhelming majority of Hungarians support the new legislation is particularly impressive, and proves that the Hungarian nation has moved completely away from the tradition of Communist constitutions, within which the previous constitution had been drafted."
"Hungary is a Member State of the European Union, and follows the rules of the club correctly."
"In case someone thinks otherwise, the club has corresponding rules on how to proceed."
"If they happen to be right, then please lodge an action for breach of duty against us."
"This is the procedure in the case of every other country as well, and we, Hungarians, do not request to be exempted from this procedure."
"We defend our point of view in a fair debate that is based on truth, but we do not wish to take part in a political witch hunt."
"Whilst clearing away the ruins left by your Hungarian Socialist colleagues, we are mobilising tremendous energies to make Hungary a democratic, European, and free country based on the constitutional mandate we received from the Hungarian citizens in free elections."
"This is the reason why we adopted the new constitution that will finally replace the communist constitution of 1949, which evoked bad memories and was the symbol of tyranny for Hungarians."
"We are a nation that loves freedom and democracy."
"Our constitution, which has protected the right to resist tyranny since the famous Golden Bull, the Hungarian Magna Carta of 1222, included religious tolerance by virtue of the Declaration of Torda for the first time in Europe, was among the first to guarantee equality before law in 1848, and has one of the oldest parliamentary traditions in Europe, is a thousand years old."
"We do not need to be lectured about democracy by those who have plenty of homework to do in their own countries."
"The European Union is built on fundamental principles such as the equality between men and women."
"However, by approving a new constitution that states that the foetus must be protected from the moment of conception, Hungary, a Member State, has trampled on these values by allowing the right to abortion once more to be brought into question."
"I have also learnt that the Hungarian Government has launched a publicity campaign against the right to abortion, funded, and therefore apparently sanctioned, by the European Union."
"I would like to draw attention at this point to the fact that the right to abortion is a fundamental right for which thousands of women have fought and continue to fight in Europe, often at the risk of their lives, that it is supported by this Parliament and by the Hungarian citizens, and that it is recognised by 23 Member States out of 27."
"In addition to disassociating itself from a policy of this nature that goes against the fundamental rights of women, the European Commission must do its utmost to ensure that the Hungarian Government puts a stop to all campaigns seeking to call into question the right to abortion."
"This is an issue of protecting our common values."
"European Arrest Warrant (debate)"
"The next item is the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on the European Arrest Warrant."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, today we find ourselves debating the issue of the European Arrest Warrant."
"It is high time that this discussion was brought to the table."
"We have submitted a question through the groups tabling a debate on the reform of the European Arrest Warrant and its application, and are asking the Commission and Council to respond with proposals."
"The European Arrest Warrant was trumpeted as the perfect example of mutual recognition in the area of justice and policing."
"When the European Arrest Warrant was passed as a framework decision, the European Parliament always made it perfectly clear that, on the one hand, the conditions for applying the European Arrest Warrant are relatively strict, so that it should apply only to really serious crimes, that it should be applied in a proportionate way, and that the procedural standards in the European Union should be harmonised at the same time."
"None of these requirements has really been met in full."
"In many specific cases, the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way, as we can see in the reports now available to us."
"Thus, we need to adjust procedures, both in practice and in legislation."
"Thanks to the work of Vice-President Reding, after ten years, we are finally making progress in harmonising procedural standards."
"However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection."
"In future, our sole concern should not just be the cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as regards mutual recognition; we must also look at the establishment of procedural standards."
"Nonetheless, the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today, as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for, particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases."
"Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has proved to be a very useful instrument in seeking justice beyond national borders."
"It has helped us open up national borders by sending a clear message to criminals that they may no longer flee to another country to avoid prosecution."
"It is therefore important that the European Arrest Warrant is seen as a useful instrument that has reaped good results."
"However, it also has its downsides, such as when it is issued for crimes which are considered too minor for its justification."
"I do not expect a European Arrest Warrant to be issued because someone is caught stealing two car tyres in another country, as has happened in the past."
"The punishment does not fit the crime and leads to a lack of trust in an important and useful instrument."
"Therefore, we need to look at the defects in the system and in its application, without destroying the usefulness of this warrant."
"It is for this reason that we are putting forward this Parliamentary question to the Commission to help us understand how the warrant was put into use these past few years."
"Such information will help us decide whether we need to update it so as to safeguard its correct application."
"author. - Madam President, the Liberal Group in the European Parliament has always been supportive of the European Arrest Warrant because of its importance in the fight against serious cross-border crime."
"However, simultaneously, my group has always pointed out that the European Arrest Warrant system would be incomplete without advancing procedural defence rights in Europe."
"We have constantly criticised the Council for not progressing that agenda on the basis of the Commission's comprehensive proposal."
"Now we are finally changing the situation on defence rights, and I applaud Vice-President Reding for her commitment to this programme under the road map."
"The question is: will this be enough to compensate for the failings of the European Arrest Warrant?"
"I think not."
"We also have to do something about the way the European Arrest Warrant system operates."
"However, let us just note the successes: between 2005 and 2009, the arrest warrant has secured the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers, child sex offenders, rapists and others."
"They include Hussain Osman, one of the 2005 London bombers."
"No Londoner could be ungrateful to the European Arrest Warrant in the light of that."
"He came back within six weeks, from Italy."
"However, in the UK at least, and we will hear this later, the European Arrest Warrant has become a favourite stick with which the Eurosceptics batter the reputation of the EU."
"Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights."
"In fact, the UK receives the second highest number of requests for surrender after Germany."
"Both the Commission and defence rights organisations like Fair Trials International - I declare an interest, I am a patron - and Justice, on whose council I sit, have pinpointed failings in the arrest warrant."
"Problems with it being used for minor offences, the lack of legal representation in the issuing state, long pre-trial detention periods, the lack of bail for people who are not nationals of the issuing state, and bad detention conditions are all cited with reason."
"The Commission does not think that we need to recast the European Arrest Warrant."
"I think we need to reconsider that."
"Firstly, we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check, so that minor offences are not covered."
"Secondly, we need to have an explicit human rights check in the executing state."
"That needs to be made explicit, and not implicit."
"Thirdly, it needs to be recognised when it is not reasonable to execute a European Arrest Warrant, so that someone is not followed by alerts in the Schengen Information System around Europe even though their surrender has been refused once on valid grounds."
"We also need to do something about the bail situation, not least by implementing the framework decision on supervision orders."
"There do need to be changes to the European Arrest Warrant, but fundamentally it has been a success."
"Those who question it need to ask themselves whether they would be satisfied with criminals spending years beyond the reach of the courts and beyond the reach of justice, because traditional extradition takes too long and has too much red tape."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, in the debate on the Hungarian constitution, we heard more than once the criticism that it was a political debate."
"I am completely taken aback by that, because having political debates is one of the things that Parliament is expressly there to do; and I therefore want to start this topic by setting out the political framework too."
"Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls."
"It therefore makes no sense to rebuild borders in Europe and to restrict the way our populations are growing together."
"On the contrary: what we need is the consistent further development of cooperation between our Member States and cross-border cooperation by the police and justice authorities."
"In this area, the European Arrest Warrant has repeatedly proven itself to be an important and successful instrument."
"At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning."
"I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State - resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border."
"That does nothing to help build confidence in European legal systems."
"Why is this happening?"
"Does the text of the directive leave too much leeway?"
"Is it a matter of incorrect implementation in the Member States or inadequate information?"
"We need to clarify these points, the Member States need to make improvements where necessary, and the Commission must take action to prevent such misuse."
"That is the only way to prevent a successful instrument being permanently damaged and confidence in these measures being lost."
"Moreover, all these experiences show how important it is that we finally make some progress on the road map for procedural rights."
"In the interests of legal certainty for everyone involved, we need to have the same rights across Europe for those accused of offences and there must be mandatory information on these rights."
"I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points;"
"I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, Ms Sippel described the European Arrest Warrant as a baby."
"Is it not in fact much more of a Frankenstein's monster?"
"Should she not accept that?"
"author. - (DE) I am not sure whether I should answer your question, as it is more of a polemic comment."
"However, the figures show that the European Arrest Warrant is an appropriate instrument for fighting crime in the unified space of Europe."
"Crime is not national; crime is international and crosses borders."
"That is why we need to cooperate across borders."
"We need to deal with the teething problems of the European Arrest Warrant and stop it being misused."
"As an instrument, however, it is indispensable."
"author. - Madam President, since 2004, I have warned that the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) could be used as an instrument of oppression against political dissidents."
"This is what is happening now in the case of Julian Assange."
"There are many irregularities in the Swedish case against him."
"Mr Assange has not yet been charged with any specific offence."
"A previous investigation against him, for what the Swedes designate as 'minor rape', was dropped by a senior prosecutor in Stockholm almost four months before the EAW was issued."
"The reinstated investigation leading to the EAW saw a failure of the prosecutor to interview witnesses that could clear Mr Assange."
"Independent legal opinion in England has said that the allegations against Mr Assange would not constitute rape under English law."
"The complainant's lawyer in Sweden has reportedly stated that the ladies themselves cannot tell if the acts in question constituted rapes, because they are not lawyers."
"Nevertheless, the tick box on the EAW marked rape contains no definition or explanation of what constitutes the crime."
"Mr Assange remained in Sweden for five weeks to answer the allegations, but he was not questioned as the investigation was unduly delayed."
"Mr Assange arrived in Sweden less than a month after WikiLeaks leaked the Afghanistan war logs and announced it had many more revelations to come."
"Senior figures in the USA have called for Mr Assange to be assassinated or kidnapped, and for the US Government to act as if it were at war with WikiLeaks, which they describe as a terrorist organisation."
"All this coincides with the convenient issuing of a European Arrest Warrant against him."
"Sweden has a close relationship with the USA in terms of intelligence sharing and cooperation, calling into question Sweden's perceived neutrality."
"Why would the USA want Mr Assange to be extradited to Sweden?"
"The Americans are still building a case against him and do not know what they can charge him with, if anything."
"Without a charge, the USA cannot extradite him from the UK, but they need him locked up somewhere while they work it out, preventing him from returning to Australia."
"The European Arrest Warrant offers the perfect expedient."
"As I have said many times in this Chamber, under the European Arrest Warrant, extradition - or rather judicial surrender, to use the correct term - is now merely a bureaucratic formality."
"There are simply no real safeguards."
"Having said all that, my question to the Council and the Commission is not: is the EAW being abused for political purposes?"
"It is: can it be abused?"
"If the Council and Commission are honest, they will have to admit that it can."
"Will they please do so now?"
"In my opinion, the evidence shows that it is most certainly happening in the case of Julian Assange."
"Madam President, the text of the oral questions might seem abstract and theoretical, but the European Arrest Warrant nevertheless concerns the fates of individuals, human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In the Netherlands, much attention has been focused on the fate of Cor Disselkoen."
"In 1997, this Dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the Polish taxation rules."
"He spent two months in prison for this, in appalling conditions."
"Having paid a very large amount of money as bail, he was released and for twelve years he heard nothing more about this case."
"However, last year, Poland suddenly demanded this entrepreneur's extradition."
"On this occasion, Poland made use of the European Arrest Warrant."
"Ten days ago, he was transferred to Poland."
"Mr Disselkoen's lawyer says he was held there in a prison which was just as filthy and overcrowded as the one in which he was held in 1997."
"Contrary to all the rules, the consultation between Disselkoen and his lawyer was recorded with a video camera."
"In addition, four new charges were suddenly added to his sheet."
"The judge even insinuated that these could lead to a new arrest warrant."
"Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations."
"In its report, the Commission has demonstrated that it is aware of the problems and that it is concerned about them."
"That is why my group is pinning its hopes on the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the Council?"
"Can you make sure that people will actually be entitled to challenge an arrest warrant in both the Member State which has issued the warrant and the Member State which is carrying it out?"
"Do you agree that it ought to be possible to consistently refuse to carry out arrest warrants on behalf of countries where conditions in prisons and houses of detention remain inhumane, that the EAW will be subjected to a human rights assessment and that Cor Disselkoen need not fear even more misery?"
"author. - Madam President, no one can deny the positive impact the European Arrest Warrant has had on cross-border crime."
"It has so far contributed to the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers, child sex offenders, rapists and terrorists, and has avoided lengthy extradition procedures in the process."
"The speed of this tool has been invaluable, given the freedom to cross borders and increases in cross-border crime."
"However, what this tool was never intended for was to investigate and punish petty crimes such as the theft of a pig, stealing a chocolate bar or exceeding a bank overdraft limit."
"What you see today is a rare occurrence here."
"Nearly all political groups and all nationalities collected here are saying that now is the time to review, re-evaluate and, if necessary, amend."
"Proportionality, protection and redress are the key to reforming this tool."
"We are now currently working on the European Investigation Order, a partner to the European Arrest Warrant."
"It is essential that we do not make the same mistakes again."
"We must draft this new legislation with a clear working memory as to the flaws and obstacles of the European Arrest Warrant."
"There have been simply too many examples of substandard conditions for prisoners, too many misplaced warrants and too great a lack of redress for those who have been victims of errors."
"I fear that we are moving forwards with the EIO whilst its very foundations, and the European Arrest Warrant on which it is based, are decidedly shaky."
"We need to rebuild the trust in, and value of, this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes, whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Kirkhope this question because he agrees that the European Arrest Warrant needs review and re-evaluation - my view would be a lot stronger than that, but never mind."
"He mentioned the European Investigation Order and I believe he was saying that this could be a step too far."
"But is he aware that, in his own government, one of the first acts of the Home Secretary, Theresa May, when coming into office was to opt into the European Investigation Order, which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine, because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine?"
"Is this another case of Tory double-speak, where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament?"
"Mr President, the position regarding the UK Government with regard to both the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order is that clearly they feel they have an obligation - quite rightly - to do what is best for the UK in relation to cross-border crime."
"We have been the victims of an enormous amount of crime, and terrorism in particular, as the honourable gentleman is aware."
"I am sure that he would share with me our determination to stamp out this crime, and working together across borders is the best way to achieve it."
"Of course, the European Investigation Order needs careful implementation."
"But merely opting into it and to the concept of it, as has been done by the government, is not, of course, the final shout."
"What we need to see here is the detail of this order; we need to implement it effectively and make it work well alongside the Arrest Warrant."
"But the fact that we have opted in is a good indication that we are determined to deal with cross-border crime."
"I trust the honourable gentleman shares our wishes in that regard."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has become one of the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted within the European Union."
"Therefore, I am very thankful to you for having initiated this debate."
"The Council has devoted a great deal of attention and energy to this issue, not least through a mutual peer evaluation of the practical application of this instrument which has been carried out in all Member States over a period of three years."
"The advantages of the European Arrest Warrant by far outweigh any possible inconveniences."
"Thanks to the EAW, the Union has managed to reduce surrender times considerably, in many cases from one or two years to only one or two months."
"The previous extradition system was cumbersome and no longer fit for purpose in the modern world of open borders and serious and organised cross-border crimes."
"On the issue of proportionality, whilst there have been some cases of minor importance for which a European Arrest Warrant was issued, it is ultimately a matter for the issuing authority in each Member State to decide for which offences it wants to launch the proceedings."
"This is a result of the fact that, unlike extradition, the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system."
"A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and the decision on whether or not to issue an EAW is for the national judicial authority."
"If there is a proportionality problem, it is not caused by the instrument or by the EAW framework decision; it is rather the result of the criminal justice policies in individual Member States."
"The Council has been quite clear that in cases where preventive detention is inappropriate, the European Arrest Warrant should not be used."
"The Council has also called on the instrument's practitioners to consider and seek advice on the use of alternatives to the European Arrest Warrant."
"Taking into account the overall efficiency of criminal proceedings, these alternatives could include using the less coercive instruments of mutual legal assistance where possible, using video-conferencing for suspects, convoking someone for appearance before a judge by means of a summons, using the Schengen Information System to establish the place of residence of a suspect, or the use of the framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties."
"However, such assessments should always be made by the issuing authority."
"The European Arrest Warrants are issued in relation to prosecutions or final convictions in the issuing state."
"These judicial decisions are based on the material available to the judge or prosecutor in the issuing state."
"Furthermore, we should not ignore the victims."
"In most cases, the victims of the offence are in the issuing state, not in the executing state, so by delaying the trial and examination of the case, the rights of victims are also being undermined."
"Justice delayed is justice denied, not only for suspects but also for victims."
"It is also in the interest of the victims to have a speedy trial so that their rights are respected."
"The Council intends to adopt a road map proposed by the Hungarian Presidency to strengthen these rights."
"The solution to the proportionality principle cannot therefore be that we change the fundamentals of the well-functioning European Arrest Warrant system, which has radically improved the prior extradition system."
"Regarding the rights of the defence, I would like first to remark that, unlike extradition, the European Arrest Warrant is a fully judicial system which, in itself, is already a major guarantee."
"A European Arrest Warrant is always based on a judicial decision in the issuing state and can be executed in the executing state only through a judicial decision."
"The person will always be able to fully exercise his defence rights in the issuing Member State where the trial on the merits of the case takes place."
"This is fully in compliance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"That does not imply that the person against whom a European Arrest Warrant has been issued is not, and should not, be able to exercise any rights in the executing state."
"Directive 2010/64 of 20 October 2010 provides for the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings and also applies in the execution of the European Arrest Warrant."
"Furthermore, we welcome the fact that a recent Commission proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right to information in criminal proceedings provides for the right to written information in European Arrest Warrant proceedings."
"Concerns have been expressed that a negative decision on a European Arrest Warrant does not automatically lead to a deletion of the corresponding alert in the Schengen Information System."
"However, the SIS alert is a means of transmission of the European Arrest Warrant."
"Ultimately, it is only the issuing authority that has entered an alert that can withdraw it."
"In cases where a Member State refuses, following judicial proceedings, to execute a European Arrest Warrant, the person in question will be released."
"If the refusal to execute the European Arrest Warrant is final, it is clear that the person can no longer be arrested in that Member State as a result of the instrument."
"However, any refusal to execute a European Arrest Warrant does not invalidate it."
"It remains a valid title for the arrest of the person concerned in the issuing Member State and indeed in any other Member State."
"This has nothing to do with the European Arrest Warrant system as such and is, for example, also the case under the extradition system."
"Finally, regarding prison conditions, these may, of course, be open to improvement in some cases, but this is not a topic which is specific to the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant."
"It is the responsibility of the authorities of individual Member States to ensure that prison conditions are up to standard, regardless of whether persons have been surrendered from other Member States or not."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, you might know that the Commission adopted a report on the implementation of the Arrest Warrant on 11 April this year."
"This report focuses on the fundamental aspects of the operation of the Arrest Warrant, highlighting for the first time since it became operational in January 2004 not only its successes but also its shortcomings."
"A lot has already been said about the successes."
"Let me just underline that between 2005 and 2009, almost 55 000 European Arrest Warrants were issued, about 12 000 were executed, and during that period, roughly 60% of the requested persons consented to their surrender, on average within 14 to 17 days."
"The average surrender time for those who did not consent was 48 days and this contrasts very favourable with the pre-European Arrest Warrant position of a one year average for the extradition of requested persons and has undoubtedly reinforced the free movement of persons."
"That is why, and I think that everybody in this House agrees, the Arrest Warrant is an important tool to catch criminals and to render our criminal justice systems more effective."
"It has been instrumental in smashing paedophile rings, and catching murderers and terrorists, and that is what it is there for."
"However, and this is a recent movement, we see that the number of Arrest Warrants issued has risen dramatically since 2007."
"In some cases, it is being used in a less than proportionate manner to extradite suspects of often petty crime: stealing a bike or a piglet."
"This is unnecessary and may damage the legitimacy of this powerful EU mutual recognition tool."
"That is the reason why the Commission asks for action."
"First, the Commission calls on the EU Member States to exercise a proportionality test when they call for an Arrest Warrant, and to fill the gaps where their legislation fails to fully comply with the framework decision setting up the Arrest Warrant."
"We also ask the Member States to ensure that judicial practitioners, such as prosecutors, do not issue Arrest Warrants for minor offences."
"Therefore, we will set out in a Handbook on the Arrest Warrant the lines to take at that level."
"We will also come forward with proposals before the end of 2011 to step up training on the Arrest Warrant for police authorities, judicial authorities and legal practitioners in order to ensure consistency and effectiveness in the way it is applied and raise awareness of the new EU safeguards for procedural rights."
"Speaking about safeguards for procedural rights, the report also reflects on the overarching importance of fundamental rights and mutual trust in the Member States' judicial systems."
"That is why the Commission has started to set up procedural rights for persons who are taken into custody."
"Firstly, minimum rules on the right to interpretation and translation, which were adopted already in 2010."
"Secondly the right to information about rights - the letter of rights - which is going to reach an agreement very soon."
"Not later than today, the Commission adopted the third proposal on procedural rights, the proposal to ensure access to a lawyer and the right to have a third person notified when a person is deprived of his or her liberty."
"It will include a provision for access to a lawyer both in the issuing and the executing States in European Arrest Warrant cases."
"All these procedural rights apply to the Arrest Warrant."
"These measures are designed to obviate the possibility that evidence is being obtained in breach of the fundamental rights of suspects."
"I would also like to answer the specific question which has been raised by the authors."
"The Commission is not aware of any evidence that the request from Sweden to the United Kingdom for the surrender of Mr Assange to face allegations of sexual offences indicates that the European Arrest Warrant system is being used for other than its purpose."
"Surrender under the Council Framework Decision creating the European Arrest Warrant is an entirely judicial procedure where the governments have absolutely no possibility of interfering in the process."
"In the specific case mentioned by Parliament, the procedure has been handled by the UK and Swedish judicial authorities without intervention of governments."
"As for the other question concerning possible extradition to the United States, I would like to underline that we are not aware of any request so far in respect of potential extradition to the United States."
"But if there were a request, this could only happen with the consent of the surrendering Member State, the UK in that case."
"Because pursuant to Article 28 of the Council Framework Decision, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant shall not be extradited to a third State without the consent of the competent authority of the Member State which surrendered the person."
"This is just to underline the legal basis of the question but, of course, the whole question is a 'what if' question, because nothing concrete is on the table."
"Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime."
"It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law."
"Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses."
"The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission's report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006."
"Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected."
"The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate."
"The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed."
"Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender."
"The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue."
"For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences."
"Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000."
"This is something that was said by an Irish judge."
"I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made."
"Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, is Mr Díaz de Mera aware that a fast-track extradition treaty was signed between the UK and Spain in 2003, long before the European Arrest Warrant, and would the speaker perhaps consider that this is a better blueprint for dealing with serious crime, rather than the European Arrest Warrant with all the problems of which we are now hearing?"
"(ES) No, Mr Dartmouth."
"I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred."
"Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days."
"That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime, wrongdoing and terrorism."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the situation for our group is very clear."
"We heard on the one hand from the Council that, if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen, its advantages outweigh those disadvantages."
"The Commissioner set out what is a credible report - a serious report - which tells us that if we can deal with trivial cases and disproportionality and with the procedural guarantees, then the European Arrest Warrant can still be a valuable way of catching serious, organised criminals."
"We should not forget the 12 000 figure - I feel very strongly about the fact that in my constituency of London, we caught the attempted bombers of July 2005."
"When we understand the serious and symbolic effect of these cases, the European Arrest Warrant can and should work."
"The oral question we have today for our group is very simple."
"We are now in the area of moving from the reports to the action, and we have a situation where we have two hard cases."
"One is the lack of proportionality."
"This will not be solved overnight, and I commend the Commissioner (I am talking about judicial training) for ensuring that we fix the issue of trivial cases dominating and creating a credibility problem for the European Arrest Warrant."
"But that also requires the Council (I am not referring just to Hungary, I am talking about the Member States) to help us in pushing forward the procedural guarantees, and the issue of unacceptable pre-trial detention periods for many citizens in my own country."
"These are the situations which create the problems for a tool which could be effective if used properly."
"But the hardest case is going to be creating an even playing field in relation to procedural defence rights."
"This is why within my group, which has [called for] the letter of rights, we take seriously both the quality and speed of the legislation which we need to ensure that the European Arrest Warrant can be the effective tool that it should be for catching serious, organised criminals, and that its credibility must not be diminished by the many trivial cases and uneven playing field that we currently see."
"This is the position we want to see for our group, and we believe the commitment is here."
"But we must pay close attention, particularly to the Member States when they ask for the European Arrest Warrant to be effective, but, on the other hand, do not carry out the actions to help us get the legislation to create that even playing field."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, Claude Moraes talked about the lack of proportionality, etc."
"We can all agree on that, but the one thing - the elephant in the room - that nobody has talked about this afternoon is the fact that the court cannot look at the prima facie evidence against the accused person and exercise any discretion about whether they should be extradited or not."
"We have many constituents affected by this."
"The most notable case is Andrew Symeou."
"I sat through the appeal court hearings and heard the judges."
"It was obvious from the look on their faces that they realised there was no real evidence against this boy; the evidence was contradictory, the statements appeared to have been concocted by the police, and in no way should he have been extradited."
"How would you address that problem and the fact that the courts cannot take into account the prima facie evidence, or lack of it, against an accused person?"
"Mr President, for an arrest warrant, there has to be prima facie evidence."
"You cannot execute an arrest warrant without the judiciary understanding what the simple facts of the case are."
"In the Andrew Symeou case, the underlying problems, I say to Gerard Batten, were procedural problems: the detention periods and court system after the arrest warrant was executed."
"You talk about the appeal procedure."
"It was the period after the execution of the arrest warrant which was problematic, and which we are trying to fix today in this debate."
"Mr President, the previous debate was passionate and also fascinating and this one is much more consensual."
"I get the impression that no one is questioning the effectiveness of extradition, of the European Arrest Warrant, the reduction in the length of proceedings and therefore, in a nutshell, the fight against crime."
"However, the way the mandate has been used has also led, as we have all said, to abuses and abusive practices: abusive practices when it is used for petty crime, and here I am not talking about the myriad farcical instances of thefts of bicycles, piglets and the like, and rather more serious abusive practices when there are disproportionate detentions, when innocent people are jailed and when the right to appeal these decisions is abused."
"Some years ago, the group to which I belong defended the need to introduce safeguards on the use of the European Arrest Warrant and I am pleased to have heard you, Commissioner, this afternoon, mention improvements to the procedure through the creation of guides for the Member States as well as guides for detainees."
"I welcome this because I think that the European Arrest Warrant is very well understood by our fellow citizens, and is a crucial test in showing just what Europe is capable of in order to consolidate justice in Europe."
"Mr President, the European Union Member States need effective tools for the fight against crime, particularly organised crime, which is the most serious kind."
"In this regard, it should be said that the European Arrest Warrant responds to a need, particularly in view of the fact that it is not only honest citizens who mostly take advantage of the freedom to move around the European Union, but also criminals, who do not by any means exercise their rights for tourism or business purposes, but for criminal activities, or to avoid being brought to justice in their own country or in the country in which they committed the crime."
"The existence and operation of this instrument is therefore to be welcomed, but we should also welcome the fact that it is being monitored."
"As well as merits, every new legal institution has certain flaws which are worth identifying, and it is also worth thinking about how to remedy them."
"In this instance, I think that it is worth considering whether restrictions should be introduced concerning use of the EAW for the most trivial crimes, for example, those punishable by up to two years in prison."
"This should be the subject of serious consideration."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I think I am right in saying that Mr Ziobro is from Poland."
"I agreed with his last remark as I heard it in translation."
"It is often said that Poland is one example of a country where there is no threshold test for the issuing of arrest warrants, either domestically or for European Arrest Warrants."
"Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint?"
"In that way, the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem."
"We very much appreciate all the Poles who are in the UK, especially in London, most of whom of course are not criminals."
"But, because there are lots of Poles in the UK, most of whom are very welcome, we get lots of arrest warrants from Poland."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Ludford very much for her question."
"We are indeed aware of the problem to which you have been so kind as to draw my attention."
"Polish courts take a very rigorous approach to these regulations, and also apply them to what can sometimes seem to be trivial matters."
"In view of the fact that many of our fellow countrymen live in London, for example, warrants are sometimes issued in questionable cases of this kind."
"In my opinion, it would therefore be reasonable for the Commission to consider introducing more general solutions, which would potentially also apply to other countries, in order to ensure that it would not be possible for the warrant to be issued for entirely trivial matters of this kind, for example, two-year imprisonments, and instead only for the serious punishments for which it was put in place."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to Mrs Ludford for asking that question, because it was on the tip of my tongue as well."
"Last week, I attended the proceedings in Poland against Mr Cor Disselkoen - his name has been mentioned already today."
"He is a Dutch national who was extradited to Poland on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant for an affair dating back to the mid-1990s."
"In the few days that he was behind bars - because, eventually, the Dutch and the Polish judges came to an arrangement - in those few days, the guard there stole the medications which he takes for his heart condition."
"The problem is not only how the European Arrest Warrant is carried out, but also that prison conditions in various countries in Europe are such that you really cannot carry on sending people there any more."
"The judge in the country to which the request is addressed should also have the discretion to say: 'I will not extradite people to a country in which prison facilities are inhumane and, as a judge, I will uphold Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights'."
"I agree with the Council that countries should be discreet about cases in respect of which they issue such a request, but countries should also have the freedom to say: 'That is such a minor offence, I am not going to extradite people for that'."
"Therefore, it is very important for Poland to change the way it administers justice."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(BG) I assume that you are talking about the same case which was mentioned a short time ago."
"The fellow Member spoke about it and I then wanted to ask him a question, but was not given the floor."
"When you are talking about such specific cases, please mention the names of the people whose rights have been violated so that we can hear them."
"This is why I will now ask you to give the name of this person who is being talked about, because we must name people whose rights have been violated."
"(NL) I make no secret of that, Mr Stoyanov."
"His name was mentioned earlier, as well, although it is possible that your interpreter did not pass it on."
"His name is Mr Cor Disselkoen."
"I also have a case concerning Mr Hörchner, another Dutch national."
"I have now mentioned Mr Disselkoen's name and he is not at all embarrassed about that, because he is eager for the European Arrest Warrant to be changed and will be happy to talk about it in public."
"Mr President, a great deal could be said about the European Arrest Warrant and the application of it by the Member States, some of which has already been said by my fellow Members."
"I want to focus on a specific and important aspect: full respect for human and procedural rights."
"Suspects and defendants have rights both as people and as parties to proceedings."
"However, often they are disregarded."
"Detention on remand and the detention conditions referred to by Mr de Jong are typical examples."
"The main reason for this is because it is taken as given that human rights enjoy the same respect throughout Europe."
"However, this clearly is not the case, because certain rights are interpreted differently from one Member State to another, such as the right to silence, or simply because certain procedures differ, such as the period of detention on remand."
"What do you intend to do about this Commissioner?"
"Will you propose specific measures, such as the introduction of a special provision on human rights which will allow judges to examine the content of cases, as happens in the United Kingdom and Ireland, or will they continue to simply rubber stamp judgments handed down in other Member States?"
"Will you make provision for the suspect or defendant to be heard, so that the judge can decide whether or not he should be sent back to the country in which he is wanted, in order to prevent abuse, such as extradition for political opinions?"
"Do you intend to propose such changes within the framework of the road map on procedural rights or by amending legislation on the European Arrest Warrant?"
"Mr President, in the Anglo-American world, the primary purpose of the law is to protect people from random arrest and arbitrary imprisonment."
"The law in continental Europe, in particular, the former Eastern bloc, simply does not have that priority and it is ridiculous to pretend otherwise."
"Under the European Arrest Warrant, everybody in Britain can be extradited - under Bulgarian law, for example - and there is not much a British judge can do about it."
"To make matters worse, the British Government has opted into the European Investigation Order, which is a further attack on the liberties of the British people."
"The Liberal Democrats, who sponsor all this, call themselves the party of civil liberties."
"This is piffle!"
"The Liberal Democrats' commitment to civil liberties comes to a grinding halt at Calais."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(Microphone off until near end of first sentence) ... Liberal Democrat."
"Is the Earl of Dartmouth aware that it was the Liberal Democrats, with support from the Conservatives in the Upper Chamber of the British Parliament, who managed to insert in the 2003 Extradition Act which implemented the European Arrest Warrant a power for a judge to refuse a surrender under a European Arrest Warrant if fundamental rights of that person would be breached."
"I am looking towards Mr Kirkhope, because his and my party cooperated on that."
"UKIP just shouts impotently from the sidelines while we get on and do the business of making sure that fundamental rights are protected."
"You should be putting your emphasis on persuading the courts to invoke Article 21 of the 2003 Extradition Act."
"I was there in the House of Lords and I helped move that amendment."
"Nothing of what you have said has invalidated the measured criticisms of what we and others are saying now."
"I would also say that you are entirely mistaken if you think that better translation rights are any sort of cure at all for this flawed piece of legislation which is ruining people's lives."
"Mr President, the arrest warrant hearings have very little in common with extradition hearings that preceded the 2003 Act."
"Even at the main hearing, the court does not consider the evidence but only 10 so-called legal bars to surrender."
"Lack of evidence is no bar to extradition."
"Even people accused of behaviour that is not an offence in the extraditing country can be surrendered under the European Arrest Warrant if the offence is one for which there is no requirement for dual criminality."
"Whilst most of these are serious violent, sexual or dishonesty offences, the list also includes the nebulous thought-crime offences beloved in so many continental countries, so that the arrested person could be sent for trial, or rather automatic conviction, to one of those wretched places."
"The fact that such warrants are issued for the purpose of prosecuting a person on the grounds of his political opinions ought to constitute a legal bar to surrender, but I suspect that some political opinions would be less equal than others."
"We were sold the European Arrest Warrant on a promise that it would be used to send terrorists to justice, but the miscarriages of justice in the case of Garry Mann, Deborah Dark, Edmond Arapi, Andrew Symeou and many others, had no terrorist elements at all."
"Worst of all have been the cases of people being extradited for questioning without a charge having been made."
"We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country's laws has been committed."
"(RO) Mr President, the European Arrest Warrant is an effective instrument for combating and controlling cross-border crime at EU level."
"It has proved effective in speeding up the transfer between EU countries of people suspected of committing serious crimes, including terrorism and organised crime."
"However, all too frequently, there have been cases where this instrument has been used to deal with minor crimes."
"Cases which were extremely unequal in severity were given equal treatment."
"Warrants have been issued when their use was both unnecessary and disproportionate."
"This has led not only to unjust situations for defendants, but has also created an unjustified burden on the resources of the state executing the warrant."
"The disproportionate use of this key instrument for fighting cross-border crime helps undermine confidence in it."
"This will make some states carry out a proportionality check based on their own rules when they decide to execute a European Arrest Warrant."
"This will result in it being applied inconsistently and unevenly and, therefore, in a lack of trust in the concept of mutual recognition."
"The right to legal aid must be guaranteed in both the state issuing the warrant and the one executing it so that the right to defence is applied in an appropriate manner."
"This is why we wanted to ask the Commission and Council these questions."
"We need to have a guarantee that the standards of criminal justice and the prison conditions in the European Union do not result in a lack of confidence among the judicial systems in Member States."
"In conclusion, I, too, would like to thank Commissioner Reding for all the actions she has taken to strengthen the procedural rights in criminal proceedings."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Reding, the fact is that the abuse of fundamental rights is one of the most significant weaknesses, as we have been saying here all afternoon."
"However, it is not even going to be possible to safeguard these procedural rights, which we have already debated and which we are going to discuss as part of the package of procedural rights."
"It will be impossible to resolve certain problems regarding prisons or preventive detention periods, for example, because they are not covered by the procedural rights package."
"They clearly fall under the powers of the Member States."
"On the issue of proportionality and minor crimes, however, I would like to tell you, Commissioner Reding, that none of the crimes I have heard mentioned this afternoon - thefts of ties, piglets and bicycles - are covered by the arrest warrant."
"The 32 crimes included only relate to organised crime, unless piglets or ties are being stolen by armed and organised criminal gangs."
"In other words, you can make fun with examples that we do not even know about right now, because the problem, fundamentally, is that we do not have any common statistical instrument with which to really tackle this issue."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, the Hungarian representative said here that the problem is not this instrument - the European Arrest Warrant - itself, but that it relates to each Member State's criminal justice policy."
"Well, now she is putting her headphones on."
"Yes, well, to my mind, this is actually a case of being economical with the truth, because now we have to admit that the European Arrest Warrant was a problem from the beginning, since we acted as if all Member States would implement certain legal norms and minimum standards for criminal proceedings."
"The truth is, of course, that we have only just started to establish them now, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would like to point out that the European Court of Human Rights has already stated that in asylum cases, no one can be sent back to Greece, for example, because the conditions in prisons there are so poor."
"I wonder when it will happen that you cannot extradite someone on the basis of the European Arrest Warrant because the conditions in the prisons in the country requesting extradition are so dreadful."
"In my opinion, the Commission should be prepared for that."
"(PT) Mr President, the European Union is an experiment made up of experiments: the euro area, this very Parliament in which we find ourselves, the Schengen area and a number of other instruments are all experiments."
"The problem is that politicians are very often less humble than scientists."
"Scientists are the first to acknowledge it when an experiment has not gone as they had hoped."
"In the case of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), we now know that this has problems and has caused doubts."
"Commissioner Reding should be credited with having had the honesty to confirm that this warrant has had problems and causes doubts, and that there are proportionality tests, which must be passed when warrants are issued and which should not be applied automatically without a judge having a slower, more measured look at them."
"Therefore, the solution should not be to abolish the EAW, which is clearly useful."
"We want a rapist or murderer to be unable to cross a border and be free."
"However, the EAW should be complemented with effective instruments for protecting defendants, with the presence of a lawyer and the right to translation, which Baroness Ludford has already tackled in her report, but also, and very crucially, the assessment of detention conditions in European prisons."
"Moreover, let us not fool ourselves or be under any illusion: being detained in a prison in country A or country B is not the same thing as being imprisoned in Europe."
"It is very important that these conditions be assessed and that there be very determined work by the European Commission to assess detention conditions, so that they can be harmonised and so that, in this way, the EAW can be applied with more confidence."
"(BG) Mr President, I have previously heard the arguments put forward by the critics of the European Arrest Warrant from the mouths of my fellow Members from the nationalist movements as well."
"However, our arguments were presented then as being Eurosceptic, as if we were some kind of enemy of progress."
"As a result, this warrant came into force."
"However, this evening I heard something else awful coming from the lips of Mrs Győri."
"What she actually said was that the effectiveness of the arrest warrant has justified the instances of rights violations."
"Mrs Győri, I am familiar with a principle in criminal law which states: 'Better 10 guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent'."
"However, from the perspective of disproportionate response, it is normal for police officers to use whatever is put in their hands and they will take every opportunity they are afforded."
"There is only one answer to the old question 'Who will guard the guards themselves?': 'The law guards the guards'."
"We as legislators, with the Commission as initiator, Parliament and the Council as colegislators, must do our utmost to ensure that the law really does guard the guards."
"(IT) Mr President, the European Arrest Warrant is undoubtedly a fundamental tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"I think that there is an understanding and agreement on this on the part of everyone who has spoken, including the Presidency and the Commission."
"At the same time, it is confirmation of how police and judicial cooperation in a cross-border approach to crime can achieve important objectives."
"Waiting times have been resolved, and the costs will now have to be verified - and this needs to be looked into further."
"Trust between the Member States is crucial in this process, which is undoubtedly positive."
"In the meantime, however, it is important to ensure that the instrument is applied uniformly in all the Member States, with a real distinction between serious crimes, for which it is intended and sanctioned, and non-serious crimes."
"It may be helpful - and here I am addressing Commissioner Reding - to involve the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which, once up and running, could verify and assess in some way these judgments by the Member States' judicial authorities, who will undoubtedly need to receive further training."
"It is true that detention conditions are not the same in all the Member States, but we are confident that next week, the Commission will issue the communication and Green Paper on basic detention conditions, which should list additional action to be taken."
"Therefore, with proper use of the arrest warrant, proportionality, strict application of the instrument, better exchange of information and training on European issues for magistrates, we are sure that uniform application of this important instrument can be achieved in full."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we can see that the application of the European Arrest Warrant raises the issue of detention which is very unevenly applied from one Member State to another."
"Some States show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment."
"Furthermore, amongst the 600 000 prisoners in the European Union, increasing numbers are detained in a Member State other than their own, due, precisely, to the European Arrest Warrant."
"Consequently, they do not enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by their state of origin."
"In circumstances such as these, there is no point in hurling abuse at each other; action must be taken."
"That is why, last January, my colleague, Mr Lambrinidis and I submitted a written statement calling for the harmonisation of detention standards throughout the European Union, and the introduction of independent national inspection mechanisms."
"I hope, Commissioner, that in the Green Papers that you will propose, you will bear this issue in mind, and that there will soon be a common platform of minimum rights which applies to all Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Györi, Commissioner Reding, as has already been made abundantly clear by the previous speakers, in recent years, the European Arrest Warrant has proven itself to be a useful instrument for fighting crime."
"Criminals in Europe are no longer free to exploit our open borders in the way that they might otherwise have been able to."
"Despite the innumerable successes that have taken place, however, the past seven years have also shown that the system is not yet perfect and that it is not being used in the way originally intended."
"You drew attention to some of these weaknesses in your recent report."
"For example, there is no right to legal representation, prison conditions are, in some cases, disgraceful and very often the investigations take an extremely long time."
"The fundamental point, which has also already been mentioned several times, is the failure of issuing states to apply consistent or indeed any consideration of whether the measure is proportionate."
"This matter is particularly close to my heart because the real intention of the European Arrest Warrant is frequently being undermined by the systematic issue of arrest warrants, often for minor offences."
"In Poland, for example - as has also been mentioned previously - where the largest number of European Arrest Warrants are issued, the judicial authorities simply do not have the power to stop national proceedings because the system has become automatic."
"I do not believe that this is what was intended."
"Before a European Arrest Warrant is issued, therefore, consideration should be given to how serious the offence is, what the expected penalty is and whether there is a simpler way of dealing with the matter."
"Finally, perhaps a cost/benefit analysis should also be carried out so that minor offences are not prosecuted at great expense."
"As I see it, consistency also means adapting the existing rules to reality."
"In this respect, I should be interested to learn what steps you are thinking of taking in this area."
"(EL) Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the comments made by my fellow Members."
"I shall start with our common assumption that combating crime is not just a national issue; it is also a European issue."
"The European Arrest Warrant marked an important step forwards in combating crime, by helping to create a European area of justice and to combat cross-border crime and terrorism."
"It also strengthens the free movement of persons within the Union, which we debated at great length recently in connection with the Schengen Agreement, by ensuring that opening the borders will not turn out to be for the benefit of those seeking to evade justice."
"Of course, voices are also being raised in protest - and I, too, endorse what was said by Mr Voss and other members - about its often unsatisfactory and disproportionate application at national level."
"We also debated cost and proportionality and everything that needs to be applied in order to strengthen the arrest warrant."
"However, I would remind the House - this is something that we faced in Greece recently in important cases - that, even now, there are people being prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or manage to get off and escape arrest by making use of the different procedural provisions and different regulations in the various national laws."
"Consequently, I think that there can be no doubt as to the value of the European Arrest Warrant."
"To close, I should like to stress that you are right, Commissioner, when you say that we need to make maximum possible use of Interpol and information available from the Schengen system."
"We need the closest possible harmonisation between the Member States so that, ultimately, we have a harmonised, modern policy which is up to the job, as the times demand."
"(PL) Mr President, the aim of the European Arrest Warrant is to enforce the law and ensure the security of citizens in the European Union."
"Freedom of movement for individuals must not make it easier for criminals to avoid being held accountable for criminal acts committed on the territory of another Member State."
"There have, however, been alarming reports concerning use of the warrant, such as the recent Commission report and Commissioner Reding's statement, in which she said that the Member States should ensure that the warrant is used correctly, and that it should not be issued mechanically or automatically for relatively minor offences."
"This statement bears testimony to the potential for misuse of the arrest warrant by the judiciary."
"Therefore, although I am entirely in favour of striving to ensure the maximum level of security for EU citizens, I would call on the Commission to monitor use of the warrant and to take steps aimed at preventing irregularities during use of this procedure by courts."
"Mr President, I had the honour to be the rapporteur in this House when the European Arrest Warrant was approved in 2001 and 2002."
"Colleagues who were in the House at the time will recall that we urged the Commission and the Council to build more civil liberties safeguards into the legislation, and we secured from the Commission a commitment to a draft directive on the rights of defendants in criminal legal proceedings."
"Not all of the safeguards we called for were inserted, and the draft directive on defendants' rights sat for many years in the Council's in-tray."
"The results of these omissions are at the root of this debate today."
"In 2002, Parliament had no powers of codecision in these matters."
"Nonetheless, we believed that, on balance, the arrest warrant was the right move."
"As many speakers have said in this debate, the arrest warrant is a hugely valuable tool in the fight against cross-border crime."
"It has brought justice to many victims."
"Where problems have arisen, they have come from poor implementation into national law, from frivolous use of the warrant for petty crimes and from unacceptable conditions of detention."
"All of these can, must and are being dealt with."
"I salute the authors of the oral questions today, with the exception of one who opposes all judicial cooperation, for speeding up the process of improving it."
"Mr President, I, too, personally believe this whole debate needs a dose of common sense now."
"I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union, particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States, including - sadly - criminals."
"I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many."
"We must now not throw the baby out with the bathwater, which is what some of the colleagues in this House would like."
"We need to seriously review the workings of the arrest warrant to include only a limited list of serious crimes - always satisfying the condition of double criminality - as being the only ones justiciable under the European Arrest Warrant."
"We must also respect fundamental human rights and include safeguards like habeas corpus."
"The large majority of UK-surrendered individuals were actually, as it turned out, migrants from other States of the European Union charged with crimes - normally major crimes, not petty crimes."
"It is ironic that UKIP, which was opposed to their right to come to the UK in the first place, is now trying to make it extremely difficult and expensive for the British taxpayer to send them back to their countries to face justice."
"(DE) Mr President, in recent years, European Arrest Warrants have been issued for trivial offences, such as the theft of two car tyres or the theft of a piglet."
"It is no longer being used to fight terrorism and serious crime, as was originally intended."
"As far as I am concerned, the European Arrest Warrant is a clear contradiction of the principle of subsidiarity."
"It overrides the most important function of citizenship - which is the protection that citizenship affords - and the Member States are obliged to surrender their own citizens."
"Since the countries of the Union have very differing legal systems, they are obliged to surrender people even if the act is not an offence in the surrendering country."
"For me, the European Arrest Warrant symbolises the concept of a European state and citizenship of the European Union at the expense of the sovereignty of the Member States and at the expense of citizens' rights."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments."
"That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime."
"In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant."
"One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime."
"I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution."
"With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, there is general agreement in this House that the European Arrest Warrant is a positive tool and has served the European Union well and acted as a security."
"The negative elements are in the implementation."
"Those negative elements have to be eliminated. The proposals which the Commission has put on the table for this purpose are the proportionality test, where we have to look at the seriousness of the offence, the length of the sentence which this offence would carry, and the cost/benefit of executing such an arrest warrant."
"In order to make this proportionality test easier, the Commission will present an amended handbook as a guideline for the application of the proportionality test."
"Training, which is very high on the agenda for the coming weeks, months and years, will be very important because we have to train judges, prosecutors and lawyers in the application of our European rules."
"The minimum standards for suspects and accused persons, which are under implementation, are very important because they also apply to the European Arrest Warrant."
"I agree with all those parliamentarians who have underlined the problem of prison conditions in Europe."
"I would like to tell them that next week, the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on detention."
"National governments are responsible for detention issues and prison management, but the Commission's role is to make sure that judicial cooperation works and fundamental rights of all citizens are upheld."
"That is why the Green Paper will kick off a public consultation, which will run until 30 November and will help to explore more closely the links between detention issues and mutual trust in Europe's area of justice."
"Everybody in this House knows that detention conditions have a direct impact on the smooth functioning of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and are the basis for cooperation between judges in the EU."
"But the system is impeded if judges refuse - sometimes rightly so - to extradite accused persons because the detention conditions in the requesting country are substandard."
"We all know about prison overcrowding and the allegations of poor treatment of detainees."
"These factors undermine the trust that is necessary for judicial cooperation."
"The time that a person can spend in detention before being tried in court and during court proceedings varies a lot between Member States."
"We have a lot of work ahead of us, and I know I can count on Parliament."
"I hope I can also count on the Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, thank you very much for this debate."
"It is clear that an overwhelming majority says that it is good that we have a cooperation system for our judiciaries, the European Arrest Warrant."
"The system works."
"It is not perfect."
"It should be improved further."
"We are, of course, open to more efficient use and better implementation."
"I agree that mistakes, arrests of innocent people, etc., should be avoided."
"Better implementation is, I think, in the interests of us all."
"I would be more specific on two outstanding issues which were raised several times during the debate."
"First, on proportionality: just to make it clear, a European Arrest Warrant can be issued to prosecute offences which are punishable by at least 12 months' imprisonment, or to execute a sentence to at least 4 months' imprisonment."
"This has been standard extradition practice for at least 50 years."
"It is enough to mention the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition."
"In the fourth round of mutual evaluations on the practical implementation of the European Arrest Warrant in all Member States, it was found that only in a few countries were there examples of issuing European Arrest Warrants for relatively minor offences."
"It seems that, in those few countries, the practice was to issue a European Arrest Warrant every time a national arrest order was issued."
"In general terms, I believe that we should only use the costly system of the European Arrest Warrant for more serious offences."
"I think that those who mentioned this were right."
"Concerning prison conditions: the Member States are under a general obligation to ensure that prison conditions are in accordance with the basic tenets of human dignity and do not violate the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment laid down in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"If people are detained in violation of their basic human rights, they can take action before domestic courts and, later, before the European Court of Human Rights."
"It is doubtful whether Article 85 of the Treaty provides a legal basis for legislative action at EU level on prison conditions as such."
"However, we are, of course, awaiting the Green Paper which the Commissioner has just mentioned with great interest."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Seven years after the entry into force (on 1 January 2004) of the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and the surrender procedures between Member States, the Commission has published some statistical data collected in the Member States between 2005 and 2009."
"Before the introduction of the warrant, the average time taken to extradite a wanted person was one year, whereas in these four years in which the EAW has been applied, it has been shown that approximately 50% of wanted persons agreed to their surrender after about 15 days."
"It is essential to take stock of the implementation and operation of the EAW now that doubt is being cast on whether the Schengen Information System is working properly and whether it should be suspended."
"We should not forget that the effectiveness of the EAW in the fight against cross-border crime, organised crime and terrorism depends on the principle of mutual recognition between Member States, which is the basis for having a real European judicial area and also for the Schengen area to work properly."
"It would be a backward step to put this situation in jeopardy; instead, we should concentrate on improving the transposition of the framework decision, especially in terms of protecting fundamental rights."
"The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) was brought in by a 2002 decision and has, to date, been shown to be an effective tool in the fight against cross-border crime, organised crime and terrorism, as was, in fact, stressed by the Commission in a recent report."
"However, there are imperfections in the functioning of the system: there is a possibility that its reputation and effectiveness may be undermined by news of its use for interrogations instead of charges and prosecutions in cases of petty crime."
"It is thus pertinent and urgent that the Council take steps to guarantee that the disproportionate use of the EAW is limited in practice."
"Furthermore, it is advisable to ensure that procedural rights are actually respected: that is, that individuals wanted under the auspices of an EAW have a genuine right to legal aid at their disposal, both in the Member State that issues the warrant and in the Member State where it is implemented."
"It must also be ensured that criminal justice standards and prison conditions in the European Union do not give rise to the Member States legal systems mistrusting each other."
"This is the only way we will be able to talk about genuine effectiveness and the true success of this instrument at European level."
"EU-Russia summit (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the EU-Russia Summit."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with you the next European Union-Russia Summit which will start tomorrow in Nizhny Novgorod."
"The European Union will be represented by the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission."
"High Representative and Vice-President Ashton will attend, as will Commissioner De Gucht."
"The summit has been carefully prepared by the External Action Service working in close cooperation with the Commission and the two Presidents, preparations built on the debates held in the European Council and the Council, on Russia as a Strategic Partner in late 2010 and in January 2011, on the results of the previous EU-Russia Summit, and the visit by the Russian Government to the Commission in February."
"Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years."
"We have concluded bilateral negotiations on Russian WTO accession, agreed on the approach towards a possible future visa-waiver regime, and agreed the Partnership for Modernisation, which is now in its implementation phase."
"Work is also ongoing in the regular framework of the Four Common Spaces and all its technical dialogues."
"Our interaction is quite intense."
"Let me remind you that Russia is the only external partner with whom the European Union holds two annual summits. The visit by Prime Minister Putin and an unprecedentedly large Russian Government delegation to the Commission on 24 February was a clear sign of Russian determination to seek closer relations and cooperation."
"Nevertheless, many significant bilateral issues remain unresolved."
"Of particular concern is the situation regarding democratic development and human rights in Russia."
"In the context of upcoming Duma and Presidential elections, the standards of the electoral process will receive particular attention."
"Now I would like to turn your attention to our main objectives for the summit, which are as follows:"
"First: the European Union will strive to encourage Russia to resolve the last remaining outstanding multilateral issues to facilitate WTO accession before the end of 2011, building on the EU-Russia bilateral agreement reached in 2004 and last December."
"Russia can still achieve WTO accession before the end of 2011 if it can take the necessary decisions to resolve the handful of outstanding issues at multilateral level."
"The summit cannot replace negotiations in Geneva, but it can urge Russia to take constructive action."
"Second: the European Union will impress upon Russia that more progress needs to be made on agreeing substantial trade and investment provisions, including on energy, in the new EU-Russia Agreement in order to provide a solid legal basis for deepened economic cooperation in the years to come."
"We do not rule out bringing the issue of Russia's unjustified ban on European Union vegetable imports to summit level, although we hope that scientific evidence will allow a quick solution at an expert level."
"Third: we shall maintain top-level support for the Partnership for Modernisation as an important vehicle for Russian commitments to reforms."
"Fourth: we will promote human rights and the rule of law in Russia, and"
"Fifth, we will encourage Russia to deepen cooperation in our common neighbourhood and continue the dialogue on other topical international issues like the Middle East, for example, or North Africa."
"In fact, progress on Moldova/Transnistria will serve as an important test case for closer foreign policy cooperation."
"Finally, we should also use the summit to reconfirm our political commitment to make progress on crisis management cooperation - provided our decision-making autonomy is in no way affected."
"Energy also figures prominently in our dealings with Moscow."
"We will emphasise the need for further reforms in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field."
"We will also underline the need to cooperate on fighting climate change."
"To pursue our goals of highest standards on nuclear safety, we interact with Russia both at the bilateral level and in multilateral fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the G8."
"We will repeat our invitation to Russia to engage in negotiations on a comprehensive Euratom-Russia agreement which should promote the highest standards for nuclear safety."
"With regard to the Fukushima accident, the European Union will push for equivalence of approaches regarding stress tests for both existing and planned nuclear power plants."
"Last, but certainly not least, we have engaged in a clear process on visa-free travel."
"The European Union has prepared and agreed in March its proposal for the list of common steps towards the possible establishment of a visa-free travel regime, and we have indeed started negotiations in April."
"Since then, a Permanent Partnership Council on Justice and Home Affairs has been held and clear progress has been made."
"But negotiations on our common steps at expert level are, to date, not finished."
"We must be clear at the summit that there are no political short-cuts."
"As far as Russia is concerned, its main objectives for the summit can be expected to focus on visas, the WTO, energy - including nuclear safety - and security cooperation."
"Russia might come back to the idea of a new Political and Security Committee at ministerial level."
"We believe that necessary cooperation structures are in place; what we need is political will to make progress on substance."
"Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the good cooperation you have shown in the drafting of the resolution."
"I will not say anything more about the points which the Commissioner has mentioned because they are covered in the resolution."
"As far as the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the final declaration of the summit next week must be more than just fine words."
"Russia is our great neighbour; Russia is an important partner."
"We are mutually dependent and the level of that dependence is great, so now we are expecting real agreements that will lead to results."
"What are our priorities?"
"First of all, the Partnership Agreement."
"We need to set the negotiations in motion."
"I expect that the EU will persuade President Medvedev to grant his negotiating team full powers to undertake specific commitments."
"It is high time that we got things moving again on the trade and investment dossier."
"The negotiations on the energy chapter are also behind schedule."
"We need agreements on a solid and transparent energy partnership and one which is based on rules."
"I would also like to hear where we stand on the human rights paragraph."
"For us, for Parliament, this is a vital part of the partnership."
"I see the modernisation pact as a complementary issue, in the same way that the common areas are."
"This is a secondary matter, but it would help if we got the WTO rules through."
"That would help to establish a level playing field while facilitating the investment climate."
"President Medvedev is personally involved in improving the rule of law, but this is not enough, as you have just said yourself."
"We need to be certain that, in the upcoming elections, Russia is going to live up to the obligations it has undertaken under the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"The elections will be the acid test."
"That, then, also means that new parties must be allowed to register."
"Russia should feel honoured that election observers have been called in well in advance."
"Lastly, the import ban on European vegetables (...)"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Russia is undoubtedly a very important partner for the European Union, but - as the Commissioner has already said - a very difficult one."
"I hope that the negotiations will not take too long."
"Unfortunately, however, they will not be completed as fast as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten imagines."
"During the process, we need to have a dialogue both with the official elected representatives and with the representatives of civil society, who are often closer to us on matters of democracy and human rights."
"The idea of a Partnership for Modernisation between the European Union and Russia is a good one."
"However, Russia also needs to play its part."
"We need more democracy and less corruption."
"We still hear many investors complaining of legal uncertainty, particularly as regards taxes."
"Above all - as the Commissioner has already mentioned - we need to prepare speedily for Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WTO membership."
"In the area of energy policy, we need Russia to be obliged to acknowledge the principles of a transparent and fair energy policy."
"There is a lot that Russia can do itself, particularly as regards energy efficiency, where there remain many shortcomings."
"Also as regards energy, I would like to bring up something that concerns its neighbour - indeed our common neighbour - Ukraine."
"Right now, Russia is once again attempting to use the issue of energy and energy prices as a political weapon."
"We must absolutely reject that."
"We are committed to the freedom of Ukraine to decide in which markets it wishes to be present and where it wishes to operate."
"We do, after all, want to have trade relations and a trade agreement with Ukraine."
"Russia should not put pressure on Ukraine in this area by giving it the option of either joining the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus or paying a high energy price."
"That is something we reject."
"Again, as regards neighbours, we also expect Russia to adhere to the agreements in the treaties in respect of Georgia and to withdraw its troops back to those areas where they were present before the conflict."
"We also hope that Russia will make a positive contribution to resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."
"On both sides, here it is not a matter of supplying arms, but rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides."
"The Commissioner has already mentioned the importance of visa liberalisation."
"It is particularly important for relations between individuals that people enjoy as much freedom of movement as possible between Russia and the European Union."
"I hope that we will soon make some progress on this."
"One crucial issue, however, will be how the next elections are held."
"Russia needs to be aware that the world, and the democratic world in Europe in particular, will be watching closely to see how these elections are carried out; whether the parties are registered correctly and fairly; and also whether certain individuals or certain parties are excluded from the elections at the outset."
"That is something that should be made clear to Russia at the summit."
"We want to see proper, fair elections in Russia too."
"Russia still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its economy."
"However, Russia is ready for democracy."
"We want to see democracy in Russia, just as much as the citizens of Russia want this themselves."
"That is our desire and our vision."
"Russia needs to realise that democracy will be good for Russia too."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we hope that further progress will be made at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod with regard to a new and comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"Both the EU and Russia must keep in mind that a true partnership can only be a straightforward relationship."
"On behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to invite the representatives of the EU to address all the concerns raised by the European Parliament with their Russian counterparts."
"The European Union will face major difficulties in relations with Russia unless the two partners rely on the same values and principles."
"If the Kremlin moves even further away from democracy and the rule of law, Russia will lose all legitimacy as a partner to the EU."
"For example, the Kremlin has prevented a number of political parties from registering for the State Duma elections on procedural grounds, and the list is likely to be extended to include the People's Freedom Party led by Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Milov, Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov."
"The surging suppression of the opposition must be brought up at the summit and the opposition parties must be allowed to register."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is not China."
"Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE; therefore, she must uphold her international commitments and obligations."
"Furthermore, Russia must abide by her own constitution."
"Russia has to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours."
"We insist that she stops pressuring Ukraine - as my colleague said just now - for example, as Prime Minister Putin did yesterday when he met the Prime Minister of Ukraine, pressing them to join the customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan."
"We cannot accept this."
"We expect Russia to withdraw its troops immediately from Georgia to the pre-conflict positions."
"Lastly, the ALDE Group is very disappointed that, on the eve of the summit, Russia has imposed a disproportional import ban on vegetables from the EU."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, Russia is an important partner for the EU in many respects."
"As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs, from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet."
"I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant, Muammar Gaddafi, to leave power."
"I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation."
"I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics, some of which are now - thankfully - gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU."
"However, the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine, and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations."
"In this regard, I hope that the Vice-President/High Representative will raise the issue of Georgia, parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers, and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova."
"I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months, which is a good idea and the way forward."
"Russia is not a mature liberal democracy."
"Neither is it a country which enjoys an independent judiciary."
"But whether we like it or not, we still have to engage with the bear."
"Mr President, Commissioner Füle, while, at first glance, it may seem understandable for Russia to protect itself in order to prevent the spread of Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection into its territory, a complete ban on imports of European vegetables is not what we expect of a country that aspires to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"That is also something we will have to talk about in Nizhny Novgorod."
"More important, however, are the political germs, or seeds, that are actually present - the weak beginnings of democracy and the rule of law."
"On these aspects, we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop."
"President Medvedev has acknowledged that economical and technical modernisation cannot be achieved without a fundamental modernisation of society."
"Yet so far, we have seen little in the way of action to accompany these fine words."
"The representatives of the EU should therefore make it abundantly clear to President Medvedev that the forthcoming elections to the Duma are a test of the credibility of his reform policy."
"Genuine and proper elections form part of the foundations of democracy."
"Anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the earliest stage."
"Fair elections start with allowing the registration of parties."
"Regrettably, early indications suggest that the Russian leadership has learnt nothing from the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that there were no grounds for dissolving the Republican Party and apparently does not wish to allow the newly established People's Freedom Party to be registered."
"More Kremlin-backed parties and an All-Russia People's Front initiated by Prime Minister Putin are merely leading us down a political blind alley."
"This semblance of competition has led the country into political apathy and devalued the Duma."
"President Medvedev could bring about a breakthrough here and end his Presidency with at least one demonstrable success."
"In the particular cases of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Magnitsky, rather than waiting for a ruling from Strasbourg, the judicial arbitrariness should be brought to an end."
"The review of these cases by the Fedotov commission is a good first step."
"Its results and conclusions should be published as soon as possible."
"The future participation of the Civil Society Forum established recently in Prague should be an important topic for discussion during the talks and negotiations between the EU and Russia."
"After all, events in North Africa demonstrate that for effective reform, you need an active civil society."
"The Russian Government should therefore work to bring this about in its own country and endeavour to achieve a partnership for modernisation with civil society."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have been searching in vain for an answer to the question of why we are debating a resolution on the summit with Russia on the eve of the summit itself and voting on it on the day the summit takes place in Nizhny Novgorod."
"Moreover, the topic was not even included on the agenda of the plenary at the beginning of last week."
"This all smacks of bad planning, and it is now a formality, in my opinion."
"Moreover, instead of striving, through a principled process, for a new agreement on relations with Russia, which we recognise as an important partner, we are notoriously repeating proclamations and demands which clearly have no hope of succeeding."
"We should, first and foremost, build on the issues where progress can be achieved."
"An example is the progress over agreements on the planned easing and possible final removal of the mutual visa arrangements with Russia."
"Instead of this, we are criticising the position of Russia in the case of imports of vegetables from the EU."
"How does our own behaviour appear, however, from outside the Union?"
"When looking for the source of the deadly bacteria, and in the absence of hard evidence, we accuse each other, restrict imports and exports of commodities and claim compensation."
"We can surely draw our own conclusions as to the level of confidence we are inspiring, and not just in Russia."
"Mr President, the dialogue between the European Union and Russia must be expanded as much as possible in various areas, from the economy to human rights, because there are no alternatives to dialogue."
"Europe and Russia are, in fact, interdependent, both economically and politically."
"I am thinking of unresolved international issues such as energy security, the Maghreb, Iran's nuclear capability, terrorism, the Caucasus, Nagorno-Karabakh, climate change and others."
"Russia is a strategic partner for Europe, not least because of the synergies that may be built in future."
"As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights."
"Russia's future is linked to Europe's and must be developed with perseverance, without complacency and despite the many difficulties that currently exist."
"In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future."
"(HU) Mr President, in connection with the upcoming summit, I would like to draw the negotiating delegation's attention to two things."
"Firstly, I would like to encourage them to reconsider the importance of Russian energy imports and, secondly, to extend the Partnership Agreement in a way that EU representatives could participate as observers in the elections to be held in December this year and in the Presidential elections to be held in March 2013."
"As we can see, energy imports from Russia are likely to increase, bearing in mind that many European nuclear power plants will be closed down after carrying out the stress tests."
"So we are, once again, beginning to be concerned that we will again be more dependent on Russia in the future."
"However, I would like to remind you that the coin has another side."
"Russia is just as dependent on the European Union, because they sell most of their products to us."
"If we do not buy their energy products, then the Russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Russia and the European Union are partners because of their mutual interests and because of their geographical location."
"This is the case whether we like it or not."
"We must make this partnership a positive and constructive one."
"That is why we need to make progress on the Partnership Agreement and on visa facilitation, to add substance to the Partnership for Modernisation, in order to work towards this."
"We need to realise, however, that this gives rise to obligations on both sides, including in respect of membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in that you cannot just continue doing as you like; rather, these agreed contractual or international rules are binding on everyone and there is no place for arbitrariness in reciprocal dealings."
"This also precludes using energy as a political weapon, for example."
"These mutual interests must be handled positively and constructively, and where external policy is concerned, this naturally also means that Russia must take on some responsibility."
"At the moment, there is the case of Syria in the United Nations Security Council."
"In such cases, Russia must make a constructive contribution to the creation of a peaceful international community."
"This also means, however, accepting the sovereign rights of neighbouring states and their decisions as regards entering into the alliances that they wish to enter into."
"Moreover, Russia must make a positive contribution in the case of 'frozen conflicts' and must now bring to an end the unlawful circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"We have a shared responsibility in the global world."
"It is clear that Russia and the European Union have substantial mutual interests in this global order, and in defining these interests, we must ensure that Russia recognises that democracy and the rule of law are also crucial for internal development."
"A degree of conditionality is called for not just in relations with us alone; a country in which there is no rule of law is also not a good place to invest, because there is no legal certainty."
"A country without democracy and the rule of law cannot really make progress in the long term for the benefit of its own citizens."
"Let us hope that the Partnership for Modernisation and other matters will help us to find a common and positive way forward here."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to mention two points because Mr Swoboda has already mentioned a number of points on behalf of our group."
"Russia is indeed at an important crossroads."
"Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012."
"One can also put a positive slant on this."
"There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia's development."
"This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity."
"My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia."
"This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation."
"We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation - not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society."
"Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper."
"Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented."
"Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity."
"We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences."
"For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible."
"We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation."
"A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes."
"We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here."
"These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace."
"You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, it is hardly conceivable that our relations with Russia are based on an agreement dating from 1994."
"We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then."
"We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia."
"Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria."
"At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran's nuclear programme is pleasing."
"As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation."
"Yet what is modernity without democracy?"
"In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes."
"Is that the best we can expect in this area?"
"Do we expect nothing more of Russia's democratisation?"
"I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections - there must be progress there."
"There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level."
"Two summits a year is too much."
"Let us have one summit, as we do with America."
"We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas."
"Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either."
"(PL) Madam President, in my opinion, the most significant aspects of relations with Russia are energy policy and human rights."
"Russia is pursuing a strategic goal of bringing individual countries under its control by exploiting the issue of gas when conducting foreign policy."
"Just in the last few days, the Russian authorities have used blackmail to put pressure on Ukraine, making changes in gas prices dependent on the country joining the Russian customs union or a merger between Gazprom and Naftogaz."
"The above actions quite obviously put an end to discussions on the creation of an EU-Ukraine free trade area."
"Long-term agreements on gas supplies are also a way of influencing the policies of EU Member States."
"We should therefore commend the position of the European Commission, which has acknowledged that the agreement concluded by the Polish Government does not comply with EU law."
"Prices for Russian gas in Central Europe are already almost twice as high as those offered to Western European countries."
"Russia's discrediting of shale gas extraction projects is causing additional alarm."
"The human rights problem is most apparent in the Khodorkovsky case."
"There can be no question that this issue must be raised during the summit, in view of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights on the unlawfulness of the arrest and detention of the Russian businessman."
"Madam President, I would like to remind Commissioner Füle of his very well-appreciated communication on the European Neighbourhood Policy; and I can hear, Commissioner, that you basically concede that we should apply the same principle to Russia as well, even if Russia is not a part of the Eastern Neighbourhood."
"But we should indeed call for what you have termed deep democracy, and we have to work seriously to support civil society in Russia."
"I would like to highlight some points in the joint resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow."
"We underline the need to maintain close contacts and support programmes for the development of civil society in Russia."
"I would like to inform you, Commissioner, that today there is very worrying news from Nizhny Novgorod, where the summit will be just starting."
"I have been informed by civil society organisations there that pre-emptive measures have been taken by the law enforcement agencies."
"Attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the EU representatives, and this is completely unacceptable."
"Even people who work on children's rights have been warned not to go to Nizhny Novgorod."
"The credit cards of the main local organiser of the civil society event - which is, by the way, the first ever linked to an EU-Russia Summit - have been blocked (for technical reasons, of course), and her car licence plates have mysteriously disappeared."
"Commissioner, I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations."
"To this end, I, together with my colleague, Mr Schulz, the Vice-Chair of the Joint EU-Russia Parliamentary Committee, have sent a letter to President Barroso, Vice-President/High Representative Ashton and President Von Rompuy."
"(EL) Madam President, firstly, may I wish you every success at tomorrow's summit, the agenda of which includes global governance, the global economy, the accession of Russia to the WTO and international issues, including developments in North Africa and the Middle East."
"Russia is the EU's third biggest trading partner."
"EU exports to Russia total EUR 65.6 billion."
"According to official statistics, the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4%, despite the economic climate, and this is forecast to continue for a long time."
"Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create numerous opportunities in economic relations between the European Union and Russia."
"At the same time, however, it will bring about innovative changes in energy, nuclear energy and international security."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, we are aware that Russia is of significance to the EU, not just where economic matters are concerned, but also as a strategic partner."
"The ban on imports of EU vegetables that has been imposed by Moscow is undoubtedly problematic in the run-up to the negotiations on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and we should make sure that Russia does not come into conflict with the WTO rules in future."
"There are also problems, however, in the area of the still unimplemented agreement from 2006 in respect of EU airlines."
"Relations between the EU and Russia are further strained by the planned US missile defences in Romania."
"If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia, then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly, give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists, or which exists as far as Russia is concerned."
"That is the only way we will make any progress."
"(PL) Madam President, the partnership between the European Union and Russia entails responsibility, including towards third countries."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours' policies."
"This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine, where Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations."
"This is nothing short of blackmail."
"If the contract is not renegotiated, gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m3."
"Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas, although it is closest to the sources of this gas."
"This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine."
"I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine, given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country's entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area, and will, in the near future, engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union."
"I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them."
"Madam President, yet another EU-Russia Summit is taking place this week."
"Major changes have occurred in the world since the last one."
"Let me mention among them, firstly, the Arab revolutions, a process of deep transformation which affects virtually the whole Arab world."
"The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant reshaped the future of nuclear power, especially with regard to safety."
"Climate change has brought more and more dangerous consequences."
"Osama is dead but terrorism is alive and has targeted innocent people all over the world."
"The list of events is long and all of them concern both the EU and Russia, two neighbouring global players with predominantly similar or complementary long-term interests."
"Their relations can only be further developed if they are based on mutual respect, openness and transparency."
"Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy, these relations."
"The EU and Parliament have always been clear about the expectations of European citizens."
"Now, with regard to the upcoming summit, I would like to highlight four issues."
"First of all, the summit should bring decisive progress on all the remaining obstacles related to Russia's accession to the WTO."
"This important step will create better opportunities for the business communities on both sides and will further liberalise trade and economic relations globally."
"In this respect, the application of protectionist measures is counterproductive and we hope they will not be hidden behind overplayed health threats, which is, in our opinion, the recent case with the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU."
"We hope that the road map for visa-free travelling announced in May will accelerate further visa facilitation and will bring closer the moment when the visa regime between the EU and Russia will be fully liberalised."
"To this end, Parliament expects that some politically sensitive issues will be properly addressed by the Russian authorities, in particular, by stopping the issuing of Russian passports to the residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"I would like to see a more constructive engagement of Russia in our efforts to support democratisation, economic and social progress and stability in the six countries in the Eastern Partnership."
"The last two years have clearly shown that this EU initiative is not aimed at competition, but rather at cooperation with Russia, since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the EU and Russia."
"In this respect, we urge Russia to intensify its efforts in facilitating the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Transnistria and in the more and more worrying Nagorno-Karabakh region."
"Finally, I would like to mention that the EU and Russia should fully cooperate in the revision and elaboration of higher standards for nuclear power safety, following the events in Japan."
"We expect that higher standards are kept, not only in the newly built, but also in the already operational, nuclear power plants."
"I hope that this issue can be part of the discussions in Nizhny Novgorod."
"Madam President, Canada's Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, likened sharing a border with the USA to sharing a bed with an elephant."
"Our Union must share its bed with a bear."
"We must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year's Partnership for Modernisation."
"As the Commissioner said, the last two years have seen improvements. The agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these."
"Progress this month in solving the Transnistria conflict would be another positive step."
"However, as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky/Lebedev judgment, and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions, real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business, which are too often absent in Russia."
"A structured civil society dialogue would help; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust."
"But the Russian bear still has a sore head and I advise the Commission to carry to Nizhny Novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net."
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, as you are surely aware, Russia is a self-confident state and the Russians are a self-confident nation."
"The relationship between the EU and Russia must take the form of a genuine partnership, and not just a feigned partnership."
"Since we have excellent relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership, relations between the EU and Russia must be at least on the same level."
"I am therefore delighted that, in your speech, you did not forget to mention the importance of abolishing the visa requirement with Russia, as relations between partners must be built on trust and openness."
"We should tell Russia clearly and seriously what the timetable is for abolishing visas, and what conditions must therefore be fulfilled."
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you for remembering, when preparing the joint EU-Russia Summit, all of the agendas that are important for the partnership between the EU and Russia."
"(NL) Madam President, first of all, a very urgent issue."
"I trust that this EU-Russia Summit will firmly address the very harmful and utterly disproportionate import ban on our European vegetables."
"The market gardening sector expects this ban to be lifted and deserves to see that happen."
"Commissioner Füle, can you confirm that the EU delegation will fully commit itself to resolving this situation in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"This is a very important question and one that I get asked a lot in my country at the moment when I talk about the EU-Russia Summit."
"I wanted to say a few words, in particular, about the problematic accession of Russia to the WTO."
"Just one more brief question."
"Georgia has, in fact, played a key role here."
"Georgia has de facto the right of veto."
"President Saakashvili is raising the stakes."
"What he wants are transparent borders - he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back - and he has, of course, also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda."
"However, Russia does not seem to be budging at all."
"In brief, is it not the case that we have deadlock on our hands here?"
"It very much looks like it."
"Besides, the Russian economy, which is mainly driven by oil and gas, does not really need accession to the WTO."
"(LT) Madam President, I call on the heads of the EU institutions not to forget human rights at the EU-Russia Summit that begins tomorrow."
"It is clear that respect for human rights is a valuable basis, without which a strategic partnership and the modernisation of EU-Russian relations would be impossible."
"The specific case we need to discuss is the ruling by Moscow city court on 24 May to reject the appeal made by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev against the new seven year sentence."
"In the 21st century, a shameful trial is taking place before our very eyes, and the sentences are not written in court."
"This is happening in a country linked to the EU by a so-called strategic partnership."
"The ruling by the Moscow court once again revealed serious flaws in Russia's court system and strengthened the opinion that it punishes those in Russia who have political ambitions, but whose opinions do not coincide with those of the Kremlin."
"The ruling made on 31 May by the European Court of Human Rights and violations in Russia of the European Convention on Human Rights are facts that must also be discussed."
"We, the European Parliament should say clearly that, if Russia's President, Dmitri Medvedev, wants to come to the European Parliament, he should appear here together with prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and this would be the most effective strategy and tactic for the modernisation of Russia."
"President Medvedev and prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, together in the European Parliament - that would be a sight worth not only the attention of the world's media, but also the heartfelt support of democratic society."
"(LT) Madam President, this summit is special because it takes place against the backdrop of the forthcoming elections in Russia."
"We expect Brussels to send Russia a strong signal about the elections respecting democratic standards, which would safeguard diversity of opinion in the Duma."
"The question of nuclear safety is particularly relevant following Fukushima."
"I am pleased that the Member of the Commission mentioned that this issue will be raised at the summit and that there will be a call for the highest international safety standards in nuclear power plants already operating and those that are planned, in both Russia, and of course, the European Union."
"I feel that EU and Russian relations with Belarus should also be discussed."
"A convergence of positions would help to open the prison gates for those who recently stood in the Belarusian elections and would stop blatant human rights abuses."
"I very much support those fellow Members who said that we need to translate words into deeds in the area of visa facilitation, and not just with Russia, but all of the European Union's eastern neighbours."
"As it assumes the EU Presidency, Poland has already found roads to a more fruitful dialogue with Russia, so that we can expect concrete steps to be taken in EU-Russia relations in the coming six months."
"(PL) Our most serious failings in relations between the EU and Russia are inconsistency, weakness and a lack of awareness of our own power."
"The Nord Stream issue is typical in this respect."
"First, we make energy solidarity one of Europe's leading principles in the Treaty of Lisbon, and then the EU agrees to the Nord Stream project, which is harmful to Poland and the other new Member States in geopolitical terms."
"We should therefore stand our ground when discussing each of the issues on the forthcoming agenda as outlined by the Commissioner."
"Russia must observe certain rules as regards the WTO."
"They should first allow Georgian wine onto their market before dreaming of WTO membership."
"As far as visas are concerned, Russia must be told that the visa regime will be liberalised for countries participating in the Eastern Partnership first, and for Russia only afterwards."
"The Kaliningrad Oblast may represent an exception to this rule."
"As regards the energy sector, Russia must be told that we are opposed to the repeated blackmailing of Ukraine, and that we are opposed to the measures taken by Russian agencies of influence, attempting to belittle the extraction of shale gas in Poland and in Europe."
"This is a great opportunity to gain independence from Russia."
"Madam President, Russia has proclaimed a modernisation programme and some observers are speaking about a new perestroika."
"So far, unfortunately, there is no real progress."
"Analysts conclude that the priority of the current Russian élites is to keep the present system in place, trying not to allow external relations to have any impact on the domestic situation."
"It is therefore up to the EU to make one issue very clear."
"The success of the Partnership for Modernisation will be dependent on the Russian Government's willingness and capacity to provide for a truly independent judiciary and to implement the basic principles of the rule of law, transparency and reciprocity."
"If the EU will not address this crucial issue in a principled manner, hardly any progress can be expected."
"Today's International Herald Tribune writes: 'Russia can't have a modern economy until it has a genuine rule of law'."
"The summit venue will be Nizhny Novgorod, in Soviet times, Gorky, where the key figure of Soviet conscience, Andrei Sakharov, was banished for many years."
"I call upon the Commission and our negotiators to follow the spirit of Andrei Sakharov and to remember the message of Sakharov Prize winner, Sergei Kovalev, in this hemicycle two years ago."
"Finally, the EU should stimulate and help Russia to come to terms with its totalitarian legacy."
"After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power."
"I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era."
"We can help Russia come to terms with its past."
"(SK) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Russia still requires a two-handed approach: on the one hand, firm demands for the fulfilment of democratic principles, but, at the same time, a rejection of Bush's well-honed anti-Russian policy."
"Russia certainly has no right to a sphere of influence."
"All former Soviet republics have the right to decide freely where they wish to belong."
"It surely has the right, however, to safety and international security."
"Such a sense of security would certainly liberalise the internal situation in Russia."
"It is necessary to draw Russia into global politics on the side of Europe, so that Russia can feel that it is an accepted partner in the creation of an international and democratic order."
"The Partnership for Modernisation must fulfil not only the state-monopoly ideas of the Russian Government, but should create an area for untrammelled industrial and scientific activity, as Mr Fleckenstein said in his analysis here."
"If we adopted a different approach to Russia along these lines, we might harbour the hidden hope that democratic processes would be liberated to a far greater extent in Russia, with a certainty and confidence that can then feed into European politics."
"I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will emerge from the forthcoming talks."
"(PL) Madam President, on the eve of the EU-Russia Summit, and in the context of negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it is important for the EU not only to speak with one voice, but to show Russia its unity and solidarity in practice."
"Energy solidarity is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, but Russia does not accept this principle, with the Nord Stream project being an obvious example of this attitude."
"We must not agree to attempts to isolate some of the EU's new Member States using the dividing wedge of the energy sector, and this should be clearly emphasised during the summit."
"We should also expect acknowledgement of the European ambitions of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and that Russia will be called upon to stop putting political pressure on these countries."
"Furthermore, we should remember that Russia is a unique democracy with a very high rate of corruption."
"(LV) Madam President, the new European Union-Russia partnership agreement must be concrete and legally binding in all areas of cooperation."
"This is a justified demand because we cannot allow for the agreement to be a collection of general phrases."
"The European Union and Russia are mutually dependent."
"The European market is no less important to Russia than Russian gas is to us, and Russian economic modernisation plans are directly dependent on our technology and expertise."
"That is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law."
"The European Union is Russia's largest trading partner and main investor; that is why the new agreement must contain legally binding terms regarding investment."
"It is important to insist on the elimination of unilateral and unreasonable trade barriers."
"This relates to the Russia - Kazakhstan - Belarus customs union, as well as to the current embargo on European Union vegetables."
"Russia cannot be allowed to continue using energy policy to implement its geopolitical interests, by discriminating against certain Member States, for example in the field of gas tariffs."
"Commissioner, in continuing to work on the visa-free zone with Russia, we must also work on establishing a visa-free zone with the rest of our Eastern Partnership states."
"At the summit, we must reiterate that the six-point agreement on Georgia has still not been implemented."
"Taking into account the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, the restrictions placed on opposition members regarding registration for the elections and on appearing in the mass media must be removed."
"We have already affirmed our willingness to be present in all phases of the election process, yet Russia must show willingness to accept long-term observers, as well as to actually implement fair elections."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that these critical remarks are not in any way directed against Russia or its people, but the opposite - they are directed against the current government, in order to improve the situation in Russia and make our cooperation more fruitful."
"(RO) Madam President, global warming, drug trafficking, the non-proliferation of weapons and energy security are common challenges requiring global solutions."
"This is why we need to build a solid partnership with Russia based on mutual trust."
"I would like to welcome the resumption of negotiations for an ambitious new partnership agreement in an attempt to overcome past tensions."
"I think that Russia must be supported by the European Union in its efforts to join the WTO, as this will boost trade and economic relations between the two partners and encourage investment."
"At the same time, during tomorrow's summit, the High Representative must urge Russia to ratify the Energy Charter because proper energy cooperation cannot exist between the European Union and Russia unless the principles of transparency, reciprocity, competitiveness and non-discrimination are observed."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I expect that modernisation will be one of the issues discussed during the summit."
"I would merely like to remind you that modernising Russia is not merely a matter of economic or energy issues, but also a matter of political modernisation and relations between the authorities and society."
"I would ask you to raise this issue."
"This also involves relations between Russia and its neighbours, and Russia's 'sphere of influence'."
"Since you are conducting relations with Ukraine so very successfully, I would urge you to make it very clear that an association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine will also be beneficial to Russia, and that we are very alarmed at the manifestations of extremely forceful political pressure being brought to bear on Ukraine on the eve of the conclusion of negotiations, while these negotiations are in their final stages."
"Please make this very clear to the Russian side on our behalf."
"These are very important factors contributing to mutual trust between the European Union institutions and the Member States, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other."
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, may I say that I was astonished to hear a man such as Mr Mölzer, who is well educated in history, say that there are historical zones of Russian influence in Europe and that this includes parts of the European Union such as Romania."
"The days of the Hitler-Stalin pact are long gone and in a democratic world, we should be practising a kind of European Monroe Doctrine; in other words, that the fate and the policies of Europe are decided by Europeans."
"That does not mean that we do not want a policy of good neighbourliness and dialogue."
"Yet Nizhny Novgorod - the venue for our meeting - should also serve as a warning, because it reminds us of the famous story of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod who believed that they could buy their freedom and their security and were then hanged."
"We have to realise that we cannot buy security with money or by glossing over reality; it is only obtainable through honest partnership."
"We need a common foreign affairs and security policy."
"We need energy independence and energy security and less dependence on Russian energy policy, which is still being used for foreign policy purposes."
"We also need to speak clearly on human rights."
"We cannot afford to compromise here."
"Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed - otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud."
"We want to have a partnership with a Russia that is in the process of democratising, but to do that, Russia must democratise - in reality and not just in our wishful thinking."
"That is why I think Mr Swoboda is right: the forthcoming elections will be decisive."
"Then we will see whether our partnership with the Russian people - of whom we are very fond - can be expanded into a genuine partnership with the Russian state."
"(FI) Madam President, as Mr Posselt also said, Europe needs Russia and Russia needs Europe."
"Cooperation between Europe and Russia is important for promoting political, social and economic stability, not just in Europe but worldwide."
"It is regrettable that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia does not meet today's needs for cooperation."
"We should make the strategic partnership closer, deeper and broader."
"The basis for all EU-Russia relations in future, however, needs to be the promotion of peace and security and support for democratic values and political and economic freedom."
"The Partnership for Modernisation should be deepened and made more focused, but mere political dialogue between diplomats is simply not enough."
"We must do everything we can to make it easier for people to meet and increase cooperation in the areas of science, art, culture, education and enterprise."
"(PL) Madam President, there will no doubt be a great many issues covered during the EU-Russia Summit, but one of the most important is anticipated to be the issue of energy security."
"For several months, Russia has been conducting a very intensive campaign aimed at obtaining exemptions for its gas infrastructure from the rules set out in the third energy package, or, in other words, the rules of our anti-monopoly law, which prohibit the simultaneous and parallel control of energy resources and transmission networks."
"Mr Shmatko, the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Kramer, CEO of the South Stream project, and Mr Miller, CEO of Gazprom, have made visits to Brussels in connection with this matter."
"This is a major campaign."
"The European Union's position on this matter must be set out very clearly to Russia, namely, that we do not intend to grant reduced tariffs to Russia; instead, what matters to us is that the gas market in Central Europe becomes more competitive and less monopolised."
"Commissioner, I would ask you to tell us plainly whether the European Commission is prepared to make statements to this effect during the summit."
"(PL) Madam President, in the run-up to the forthcoming summit, we really can say that the European Union lacks a single coherent strategy as regards Russia, and that the current policy of pragmatic cooperation based on a strategy of small steps may very easily fall apart during whatever crisis occurs next, as was the case in 2008 during the war with Georgia, or in 2009 after gas supplies were cut off."
"In the context of the latter event, it is very important to emphasise the definition of the word 'diversification', which in Europe is often synonymous with the construction of a large number of different gas pipelines from Russia."
"Diversification is taken to mean the construction of the South and Nord Stream gas pipelines, for example."
"Meanwhile, the European Union should concentrate on guaranteeing gas supplies from non-Russian sources: it should do more to promote the Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan, and it should invest in gas terminals and research into extracting shale gas."
"It is also very important that pressure continues to be put upon the Russian authorities at various levels to improve the human rights situation in Russia."
"Apart from discussion in the framework of the EU-Russia summits, we should ensure that the consultations which take place twice yearly with European Union representatives and diplomats from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are decisively stepped up."
"(PL) Madam President, I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that we expect them to behave responsibly."
"Russia is potentially a very important partner for the European Union, for example, when it comes to finding a solution to certain frozen conflicts in Europe which remain unresolved."
"I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that although vegetables and gas are important, they must stop supporting Transnistrian separatists, that we expect them to stop supplying weapons to Azerbaijan and Armenia, since this poses a great risk for the future of this region, and that we also expect Russia to fulfil its obligations under the agreement on Georgia concluded in 2008."
"We expect that Russian forces will be withdrawn from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and we expect that Russia will respect Georgia's right to consider and decide its own future."
"(PL) Madam President, although I agree with Mr Lisek's statements on Georgia, and not forgetting what many MEPs have said about Ukraine, it seems to me that at tomorrow's summit, we must also spare a few words - or a great many words - for Belarus."
"I would ask everyone to remember that we have been dealing for many months with a very far-reaching political crisis there, and that for at least several months, we have been dealing with a far-reaching economic crisis."
"We are also dealing with a situation in which Russia is putting pressure on Belarus, probably a great deal more forcefully and effectively than it currently is on Ukraine."
"Russia is effectively attempting to take over the entire economy, or rather strategic sectors of the economy, by taking advantage of the dramatic situation in which the Belarusian economy finds itself."
"I have one request."
"If Russia decides to provide aid, and we know that it has decided to provide aid to Belarus, the European Union should ensure that Russia makes this aid dependent on the observance of human rights."
"These are common values that we apparently share with Russia, a fact which is often repeated by the Russians, and so they should help us to introduce these values in Belarus."
"Otherwise, by funding the Lukashenko regime, we will be responsible for it."
"(SK) Madam President, we always have a number of problematic issues on hand for negotiations with Russia, such as the standard of civil rights, the nonsensical ban on imports of vegetables from the EU, the anti-missile shield located in the EU, or the problematic involvement of Russia in many former Soviet republics."
"I do not want to say that we should avoid talking about these difficult topics, but I firmly believe that we should not limit ourselves to them."
"We should also bring new ideas for mutually beneficial cooperation."
"European producers need new opportunities to sell their products."
"Russia is an enormous trade area, with ever increasing purchasing power."
"It is therefore necessary to work more intensively to eliminate the obstacles that are holding back trade cooperation, and also jointly to support projects such as the extension of the broad-gauge railway line running from the Pacific to the heart of the EU."
"Projects such as this can create new impulses for cooperation, the implementation of which will bring benefits not only to Europe, but also to Ukraine, Russia and many Asian countries."
"(PL) Madam President, talks are being held between the European Union and Russia on the future of the energy sector, but from what I understand, a new group is currently being set up, which will debate the third energy package in the context of gas security."
"I would like to call on Commissioner Füle, and on Commissioner Oettinger, to provide the European Parliament with information regarding the progress of the talks and the outcome of this group's negotiations."
"We would also like a list of the members of the negotiating group."
"I learnt from a representative of a Russian energy concern that the company would be participating in these negotiations."
"I would like to know whether this is true, and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side."
"Compliance with competition law in the field of energy, without the granting of any exemptions, is also a very important matter for the European Parliament."
"During the recent presentations of South Stream investment plans in Brussels, it was apparent that Russia and Gazprom want privileges and a special status."
"We cannot agree to this."
"Madam President, I see Parliament's resolution as Europe's hand extended to the Russia of today which needs, despite all its baseless pride and inherited arrogance, a really friendly advice and action plan."
"As the Human Rights Consultations advising President Medvedev have called for an essential renovation of the national house from basement to roof, our Parliament is coming not with empty appeasement but with constructive provision of cooperation."
"The greatest chance appears there if Russia is open and striving to build an open society, not one that is closed in backward Stalinism."
"Unfortunately, Russia's pressure on the rest of the G8 to accept the occupied territories of Georgia in the WTO system on the side of Russia does not testify to their really good will."
"If it is true that the West has consented to this, it is unfortunately thus showing its weakness just before the Nizhny Novgorod Summit."
"(DE) Madam President, Russia is no doubt an important partner for the European Union, but a very difficult one."
"Accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is undoubtedly of great importance to Russia."
"However, I would like to call explicitly for a democratic process at both a political level and at the level of civil society."
"It is absolutely essential that human rights are respected and observed."
"(RO) Madam President, the EU-Russia Summit is taking place against the background of regional developments which influence this partnership."
"Reform of the European Neighbourhood Policy may help resolve the conflict in Transnistria."
"Indeed, Russia has shown an interest in setting up a joint political committee."
"However, the structure and deadline for setting up this body are due to be discussed."
"The food crisis which is affecting Europe at the moment has brought trade with Russia to a halt."
"New negotiations on current sanitary regulations could improve this situation."
"Russia's membership of the WTO will have a long-term impact on economic relations with the EU."
"This is why all the relevant agreements need to be revised."
"The energy issue is another topic of interest, as a result of launching the AGRI project."
"This would offer an alternative source to that provided by the Nabucco project."
"Madam President, it is good that the European Union should strive to have the best possible relations with all its neighbours, and indeed with all countries around the world."
"Sometimes, that can be difficult - particularly, I suppose, when it comes to Russia, because it has a very chequered history."
"Even since the fall of the Iron Curtain over 20 years ago, its behaviour towards some countries, particularly neighbours such as Georgia, certainly cannot be admired."
"Obviously, any negotiations with Russia have to be underpinned by a recognition of the important values of respect for human rights and respect for neighbours."
"Nevertheless, they do offer a great opportunity for tackling global issues like climate change and also, of course, a great opportunity to develop both our economies."
"Russia is a rising country and a developing country in terms of wealth."
"Certainly, if the fundamentals are right, there are great opportunities both for the European Union and for Russia in the long term."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, today's exchange of views was indeed very useful for adding a final touch to our summit preparations and you can rest assured that I will convey the key messages to the High Representative and Vice-President Ashton who will debrief the Presidents and Commissioner Karel De Gucht."
"I have heard many of you calling for continuing engagement with Russia, calling for the relationship and coordination with the Russian Federation to be further developed, but I also heard calls for more democracy and less corruption."
"I also heard a call for no harassment, which was reported in Nizhny Novgorod, although I respect the role of the Russian Federation in ensuring security for the summit."
"We have seen that we have convergent views on many subjects."
"We agree on the key importance of our relations with Russia both bilaterally and in multilateral contexts, whether regional or global."
"We agree that it is a multifaceted relationship in which economic, social and environmental issues, human rights and rule of law, security aspects and political cooperation are all of paramount importance."
"We should not expect a resolution of all pending problems at this summit - and yes, we will raise the issue of vegetables."
"But we should aim to make significant progress in a number of areas."
"Let me comment on some of these areas."
"First: elections."
"The Russian authorities are well aware that the European Union will be following the 2011 and 2012 electoral processes very closely."
"Should there be irregularities in the upcoming elections, these issues would have to be addressed."
"Right now, we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections, and to cooperate well with ODIHR to ensure appropriate monitoring."
"We will place a special emphasis on the issue of the registration of new parties and access to the electoral process."
"Second: I took note of Parliament's concerns with regard to the human rights situation in Russia; we share most of them and these issues will be raised with the Russian President at the summit."
"The main forum for addressing human rights and rule-of-law issues is the European Union-Russia human rights consultations."
"This is an important instrument and its potential should be fully used."
"Unfortunately, this is not yet the case and the European Union will therefore stress the need to have an honest and useful dialogue for which a review of the consultations' modalities is necessary."
"Third: the Partnership for Modernisation."
"I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Partnership for Modernisation should be broadly based."
"The coordinators will present in Nizhny Novgorod the second programme report on the implementation of the partnership and, as you will see, the rule of law is at the very core of this initiative and we have concrete projects in this area."
"Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours, and I think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer to the recently adopted ENP review document and, with reference to this document, to make sure that we are transparent in our policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia."
"This is an opportunity - based inter alia on that transparency - to make our point that caring about the well-being of the neighbours we share is a win-win process."
"I think it will also be a good opportunity, based on some new ideas in that ENP review, to talk about a strengthened cooperation to address the protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood."
"Point five: the question of energy cooperation will be addressed at the summit."
"We need transparent, fair and competitive energy relations and we will raise our concerns with the Russian President."
"We will emphasise the need for further reforms, as I stressed in my opening remarks, in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field."
"Madam President, honourable Members, the European Union and Russia are partners."
"Partners should talk to each other frequently, they should try to achieve consensus where possible, but should not hesitate to openly address more problematic aspects."
"We have talked about some of these problematic aspects today."
"They should be addressed at the summit and, wherever possible, we should look for solutions or at least improvement."
"I have already mentioned the ENP review."
"I strongly believe that one of the added values of that reviewed Neighbourhood Policy is that the universally applicable values and principles reflected there are not only applicable to small and medium-sized neighbouring countries."
"I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (9 June 2011)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I am pleased to be one of those signing this resolution, which reaffirms the importance of respect for democracy and human rights in relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Starting with the Russia-EU dialogue on human rights and continuing with the summits, I think that a systematic and honest approach is required in cases where the standards for a fair trial are not respected or human rights activists or journalists are persecuted and prevented from doing their job."
"Furthermore, clear reference criteria need to be introduced regarding Russia's respect for democratic standards, which will help deepen relations with the EU."
"Lastly, we must not forget either the support which needs to be given in developing civil society, as the guarantor of a democracy which will not only stick to procedures but be truly inclusive as well."

"Decisions concerning certain documents: see Minutes"
"Application of EIA Directive in Austria (debate)"
"The first item is the oral question to the Commission by Erminia Mazzoni, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the application of the EIA Directive in Austria (Ο-000084/2011 - Β7-0314/2011)."
"Madam President, I have a point of order under Rule 96 by prearrangement with the President, whom I would ask to write to the Formula One Teams Association - including Lotus in my own constituency - which made clear in a letter yesterday that it objected to a rearranged Bahrain Grand Prix on logistical grounds."
"I would ask the President, in that letter, to remind those teams that there is a fine tradition of sportspeople withdrawing from events on human rights grounds - from Muhammad Ali and Vietnam to cricketers refusing to go to South Africa under apartheid and athletes to the Moscow Olympics."
"I would also ask the President to make it clear on behalf of the European Parliament that should any of the teams withdraw on human rights grounds, they would have the support of this Parliament, and that the bloodied name of Bahrain should not stand, this year, alongside the proud European names of the Nürburgring, Monza, Monaco and Silverstone."
"We have noted your point, Mr Howitt, and we shall pass it on."
"(SV) Madam President, I am rapporteur for the report on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements after the Treaty of Lisbon and, following thorough consideration of Parliament's vote and the Council's proposal, I would like to step down as rapporteur for this report, as the position of both the Council and Parliament so one-sidedly favours the interests of investors and does not take account of the need for transparency."
"Furthermore, the old Member States are not taking into account the need of the new Member States for new agreements, and investors' rights are not balanced in any way by environmental, social and other legal requirements."
"I therefore do not feel able to defend Parliament's position, nor do I feel able to lead these negotiations to a successful outcome."
"I therefore ask to be allowed to transfer the task of rapporteur to the committee chair."
"That is a procedural point and you should bring it before the competent committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Mazzoni, the chair of the Committee on Petitions, who is unfortunately unable to be with us."
"No doubt there are more important petitions than this one."
"This petition does not concern thirty thousand people, as in the case for some other petitions that are pending in this House."
"The drivers behind this question as far as the Committee on Petitions is concerned are nature, which is a contentious matter locally, how the local economy is allowed to develop, and, above all - and I will come back to this subsequently - the uniform application of the law in the European Union."
"Perhaps I might make another comment before going further."
"The report on this case - on this ski lift project - shows that the local media delight in seeing someone or other on the ground."
"It could be a lobbyist for nature, a lobbyist for business, the local authorities or the national government."
"That is not appropriate in this case."
"We went on a local fact-finding mission - Mrs Lichtenberger accompanied me - and the impression that the European Union can act as some kind of supreme court of appeal is entirely misplaced."
"We have to rely to some extent on local authorities implementing the law properly."
"This takes us to what is at the heart of the petition."
"The petitioners assert that the local threshold for carrying out an environmental impact assessment (EIA), which was 20 hectares at the time, was not adhered to; that instead, the project was artificially subdivided into smaller parts and that in reality, the 20 hectare threshold was exceeded."
"As an aside, a 10 hectare threshold has since been introduced in Austria."
"Things have therefore changed somewhat in any case."
"When we investigated locally, we concluded that the provisions concerning environmental impact assessments, as applicable in Austria, were complied with at the time - at least in essence."
"One might argue over the odd square metre or other measurement, but in our view, the dispute does not concern vast areas."
"Neither do we feel that consideration of individual aspects of the development would obviously lead to a different conclusion."
"This applies, for example, to the issue of the lake created to provide water for artificial snow, the issue of parking facilities serving the project and other aspects."
"However, we came to the view that we needed to look a little more into what was behind this case."
"We questioned whether the way the national government had applied the law on the EIA was correct and in accordance with the spirit of our European regulations."
"We then soon saw that to some extent, it was possible for the provisions to be applied in different ways - not just in Austria, but also in some other Member States, including my own country."
"The question arises as to whether we should always allow projects to be sliced up locally."
"The question arises as to whether we should allow projects to be divided into separate stages in time, if, in retrospect, one can say that actually it was all part of an overall plan and should have been looked at as a whole from the start."
"There are also cases of projects being subdivided locally as far as their legal arrangement is concerned, which gives rise to the question of how much this is permitted by our European legislation - deliberately or otherwise - and whether things need to be tightened up in this respect."
"One particular point stood out for us in respect of such facilities."
"Can we really allow ski runs - new ski areas of 1, 2, 3 or 10 hectares which are added on to ski areas or which will be more heavily trafficked as a result of the expansion of existing ski facilities - to be completely disregarded in the calculations?"
"My personal opinion is that, based on the European rules, all the areas to be used should be included in the overall project, hence our specific question to the Commission as to whether it does not feel that we need to tighten up the European regulations in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, Mr Potočnik and I are pleased that we have a parliament that has made the monitoring of environmental regulations a focal area of its work, as is the case in this instance."
"The EIA Directive is of great value for the ecological development of the European Union."
"For us, it is an important instrument for achieving sustainable development."
"It states that projects that have a substantial impact on the environment must undergo an assessment in which all their direct, but also indirect, effects on the environment are evaluated."
"These are types of projects in which the Member States have to decide, using threshold values, whether the results of this assessment mean that an EIA must be carried out."
"The circumstances in your ski area belong to a class of projects in which Member States have long had to decide whether an EIA is necessary."
"The Austrian legal provision was not really satisfactory in the past."
"It concerned an area of 10 hectares or of 20 hectares or more."
"After we received the petition, the Commission asked the Austrian Government how it had ensured that the directive was properly applied in this project."
"Austria replied that it had not had to carry out an EIA because the threshold of 20 hectares had not been reached."
"There was then official doubt on our part."
"We pointed out that in determining the size of the area, and thus deciding on whether an EIA was necessary, an overall view should be taken rather than looking at the area in its narrower sense."
"Austria then revised its law on EIAs, which I think is the most important result in this individual case."
"In our legal opinion, it now complies in every respect with the requirements of the European EIA Directive."
"The decision as to whether an EIA is necessary when a ski area is expanded now depends overall on the size of the enlargement in land area and whether it lies within a designated nature conservation area."
"Moreover, earlier expansions are also now to be included in the appraisal."
"The requirements of the EIA Directive are actually clearly and strictly stated in this respect."
"Circumventing these merely by subdividing projects into stages, into sections or tranches, is not possible."
"We place great importance on an overall analysis of the impact on nature."
"The European Court of Justice has confirmed our interpretation of the law."
"It has made it clear on more than one occasion that the aims of the EIA Directive cannot be circumvented by subdividing projects."
"As far as the threshold area is concerned, taking into consideration only those surfaces on which building work is actually to be carried out is too narrow."
"We are concerned not just with the building work, but also with its overall integration into the surrounding area."
"In other words, when calculating whether the threshold area is reached, one must include areas in which no building works are actually taking place, but which are indisputably part of the project and part of the impact of the project."
"That is why we feel that screening should have been carried out in the Damüls-Mellau ski area before the expansion took place in order to establish whether an EIA was necessary for the project."
"This decision should also have been made public, giving the reasons behind it."
"These are the obligations with which the Austrian authorities did not comply."
"They failed to carry out such screening, which, in our view, was a requirement."
"The project is in the past; it was decided on five years ago and approved five years ago."
"Construction is already complete."
"We have therefore requested further details of the effects of the works from the authorities in Vienna and have also made enquiries as to whether measures to alleviate the consequences are necessary and can still be considered."
"Once we have received this information, we will examine whether further steps can be taken to alleviate the effects on nature in this area as a whole."
"We have also asked the authorities in Austria to confirm to us that in the event of the future expansion of this or other ski areas which met the criteria under the old version of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments, screening will first be carried out to ascertain whether an EIA is necessary."
"Mr Potočnik is currently working on a revision of the EIA Directive."
"Both he and we intend to submit a new text that further enhances environmental protection, which especially takes into consideration the areas of climate change, energy and biodiversity, which also includes relevant important rulings by the European Court of Justice and which harmonises and simplifies the existing procedures as far as possible and, moreover, excludes circumvention more clearly than previously."
"Mr Potočnik is in the process of preparing the recast of this directive and has therefore consulted broadly with the public and the relevant interest groups over the past year."
"The results are currently being evaluated and we will table a proposal accordingly in 2012 at the latest."
"The improper execution of this construction work will at least have a positive effect for the future, because European law will be worded more clearly and will no longer be so easy to circumvent."
"We are pleased that the Austrian act on the EIA now complies with the directive."
"The Commission will take action to ensure that the Austrian authorities look at the environmental impact of the work that has already been carried out in order to ensure that in any future expansion of the ski area in the region around Damüls-Mellau, the requirements of our directive are applied in accordance with the rules."
"In other words, we have all learnt from the mistakes made in this individual case."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Wieland has already outlined the facts of the case very clearly."
"I would like to add one or two political assessments, if I may."
"Firstly, the fact that existing regulations or directives are examined to see how well they are working in practice or how well they are achieving their objectives and are then improved or interpreted more precisely where necessary is not an argument against European policy, but rather an argument in favour of such policy."
"There will always be competition between European regulations and directives and the form that these take at local level."
"The Committee on Petitions may not be a court of appeal, but in my own understanding of what we are doing in the Committee - in other words, what I understand as my role as a member of the Committee on Petitions - I am rather proud that this petition, in which we saw that things were being interpreted differently at local level than was our intention at European level, together with the opinion of the Committee on Petitions, ultimately resulted in the law being changed in a Member State."
"I consider that to be a great success, and a success of European policy."
"The general problem as I see it is the question that I will now put to the Commissioner."
"Many citizens are concerned about how European law on the environment is being implemented in the Member States."
"There are many petitions on this."
"Many of these are concerned with cross-border matters, but there are also many concerning circumstances in the Member States."
"Time and again, we face the problem that when we make enquiries to the Commission while matters are in progress, we get the answer: 'We assume that Member State X is implementing and applying the existing directives and regulations of the European Union appropriately."
"We see no need to intervene'."
"We need an instrument that we can use to enter into a serious dialogue with the Member States while matters are in progress if there are indications that something is going wrong, so that we do not end up in the same situation as in this case."
"Things did not go optimally, but it is done now and we have a solution for the future - but not, unfortunately, for the past."
"Madam President, I think we can describe what happened here as a lesson from which we have learnt."
"We Austrians are very keen skiers."
"For that, of course, you need ski runs."
"However, as we must be aware and must take into consideration, a beautiful, intact environment is also a part of skiing, and people will not go skiing where this no longer exists."
"Seen in the light of this situation, Austrian policy has made many mistakes in the past."
"Ski runs have been added unilaterally without considering whether more runs are actually a good idea, and administrative practice and the legal situation were also characterised by this mindset."
"What happened here demonstrates the value added by the European Union and the European Parliament."
"In this case, it seems that things went wrong."
"In many cases when things go wrong, nothing happens."
"In this case, however, a petition was tabled, people reacted accordingly and Austria put its house in order."
"As far as I am concerned, it provides a good example of what should happen."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am very grateful for the information you have given."
"I consider what you have said to be very important."
"I have just one supplementary question."
"You said that the Commission is entirely satisfied with the way that Austria is now implementing environmental impact assessments."
"However, there still remains a ruling by the European Court of Justice stating that citizens must be involved in the procedure for establishing whether an EIA is required."
"This has not been incorporated into the revised Austrian act and it could act as a kind of early warning system to ensure that what we saw in Mellau cannot happen again."
"I would like to emphasise once more that I think it somewhat absurd if ski runs are not included in the size of a ski area just because the entire mountain has not been dug up."
"As I see it, those are ultimately the areas concerned and they must be included."
"It is quite clear that this is a case in which a project was subdivided into smaller parts for the purposes of circumvention."
"I hope that you will bear this case in mind in future proceedings."
"Madam President, we have a case that can help us resolve an issue that the Commission has, in fact, acknowledged, that has also been raised by Mr Jahr, and that we are going to include in the annual report that will be presented by the Committee on Petitions in the discussions regarding 2010."
"The situation is as follows, and we have the example of Damüls in the Alps, and also that of the Pyrenees: it is often the case that the time taken from the moment a complaint is made by some European citizens until it is resolved can be too long to resolve the issue without irreversible damage resulting."
"I am referring to the ability that many Member States have to evade the European directive requiring an environmental impact assessment for public or private projects in very sensitive areas in the European ecosystem, such as the Alps in this case, or it could be the Pyrenees in Spain."
"In this case, a project has been split up and divided to evade the directive, thus preventing any environmental impact assessment from being performed."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, if you really accept that environmental impact assessments need to be strictly implemented, I think you have to react more quickly to stop projects going ahead despite reports that indicate that these projects need a prior environmental impact assessment."
"Therefore, it is very important for us to change the time a complaint takes to be resolved and for the Committee on Petitions and the European Commission to work to shorten those times so that Member States do not evade the need to implement the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive."
"It has been evaded in many Member States, as has already been mentioned here, not just in Austria."
"In my country, Spain, we now have a project pending in the Pyrenees."
"It is also a ski resort, in the Castanesa valley, and the Spanish state is going to do the same."
"In this case, the responsible authorities in Aragon are going to split the project up in order to prevent the environmental impact assessment from taking place."
"I believe that in both the European Parliament and in the European Commission, we have to work to speed up the procedure."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the environmental impact assessment is, in accordance with the precautionary principle, to determine and assess the direct impact of projects on the environment, but also their indirect effects."
"Excluding planned development that is clearly linked to the project in geographical or other terms can only undermine the legal situation."
"The European Court of Justice ruled back in 1996 that Member States must ensure that the aim of the directive cannot be circumvented by subdividing projects."
"In its 2003 report on the application and effectiveness of the EIA Directive, the Commission found that the roots of the multiple problems that were hindering the effectiveness of the EIA provisions lay not necessarily in the implementation of the directive at national level, but rather in its practical application."
"One of the recommendations formulated at the time was aimed specifically at those Member States, such as Austria, that had established binding thresholds."
"It was recommended that where projects might possibly have a considerable environmental impact, appropriate screening should be carried out - particularly as regards sensitive areas and the possible cumulative impact of projects."
"You mentioned the screening process in your introduction; we are awaiting the results."
"Austria's citizens are increasingly protesting that too little consideration is given to their concerns."
"The European Court of Justice has ruled that the individual act at national level must be sufficiently detailed and provide for adequate public participation."
"What is the Commission's assessment of this aspect in the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments?"
"Criticism of the lack of public participation is something that can be heard in nearly all the Member States."
"The current revision of the EIA Directive should also include a debate on a review of the uniform procedure for public participation which is actually laid down in the directive."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, looking at the list of speakers, one might get the impression that the Community and also the Committee on Petitions is seen as some kind of supreme court in this process."
"I would also like to say that these projects are not something from which we should be scoring political points."
"We are talking here about a project in Damüls-Mellau."
"These are two small communities."
"The provincial government in Vorarlberg and the local administration tried to apply this Austrian law on the environment to the best of their ability."
"I believe that there is no reason to reproach these authorities."
"The legal question arises, however, as to how the Republic of Austria has transposed the EIA Directive."
"Here, one must bear in mind that the legal traditions in Austria and also in the European Union vary widely."
"I must point out to my fellow Member that I believe that Austria tried to do things properly."
"In the course of this process, lawyers came to the opinion that a few mistakes may have been made."
"I would like to emphasise once again that we are talking about just the last couple of percent here."
"In this project, measures have been taken voluntarily to compensate for this, which seems to have been forgotten."
"Substantial payments have been made."
"That must also be stated."
"Finally, we should probably also carry out a political appraisal."
"Bearing in mind that compensatory measures have been carried out in this project, that an attempt has been made to put right any wrongdoing that may have taken place, then surely the project can be rubber-stamped."
"Regrettably, at this juncture I must ask the Commission to treat everyone equally and to look outside our borders at some cases in other Member States where much greater damage is actually being done to natural resources."
"The Commission should, however, proceed with a certain amount of circumspection here."
"Such circumspection is particularly important in the area of environmental policy if it is to gain wider acceptance."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise the aspect mentioned by the Commissioner that 'the national authorities have learnt from this', because I believe that the way the Austrian national government - and specifically the environment minister responsible - has proceeded with the amendment of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments is to be seen as very positive and could be used as an example, as a benchmark, for many other cases with which many people are not as familiar."
"Finally, however, I would like to give my support to the amended petition by Mr Jahr which calls for specific and effective tools to allow influence, monitoring and correction as far back as the planning and early stages of such projects."
"(PT) Madam President, I have some very brief observations which arise from this process."
"Notwithstanding its positive aspects, the experience of the practical application of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure also shows us that it can and should be improved."
"It is important to look at analysis of projects' cumulative impact in a different way, whether they are of the same type or are all different."
"Too often, we cannot see the woods for the trees."
"It is important to learn in a more complete way about the major and cumulative impact human activity has on nature."
"Also, the post-EIA stage should merit closer attention: it is frequently neglected."
"It is important to assess the extent to which predicted impacts are realised, how effective minimisation or compensation measures are, if there are any, and the extent to which they are or are not implemented."
"Public environment authorities have a key role to play here and should be properly equipped to put it into effect."
"Finally, the transparency of the procedure, and public participation and scrutiny thereof, are of crucial importance to ensuring, as far as possible, the transparency, quality and independence of the study."
"(LT) Madam President, today we are debating very specific issues about a specific country, but environmental impact assessments are still a rather complicated and difficult matter, both at national and international levels."
"Probably the greatest problem is a crisis of confidence in society over the environmental impact assessment examinations carried out, that is, the fact that project operators carry out the examinations, etc. The public should therefore be more actively involved in this process but, of course, we need to strike a balance, so that projects are not stopped without justification."
"Another problem is the concept of post-project assessment, when certain things, including environmental impact analysis, are not mentioned and some side effects emerge later."
"Yesterday, we voted in favour of the principle of independence in the impact assessment system."
"This should also naturally be applied in environmental law, and when reviewing the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, we should focus on precisely this issue."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 (8))"
"(DE) Madam President, it may be that I have misunderstood Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, which is why I wanted to ask."
"I believe that it is important for the rules that are currently in force to be followed."
"We should not always be able to talk our way out of things by saying that we do not need to keep closely to the rules because of a change in circumstances."
"Rules must always be followed to the letter and rightly so."
"I would like to know whether you meant that the rules must be adhered to, regardless of the situation, and that people should not always be guided by the circumstances."
"(LT) Madam President, I would like to stress that it is very important to respect the rules, but there are cases where certain interest groups, perhaps manipulating public opinion, try to influence the implementation of certain projects."
"However, as I have already underlined, autonomy, appropriate analysis and the independence of experts must be guaranteed, and everything should be done according to the rules, as provided for by legislation."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, this discussion once again highlights the fact that with regard to the whole area of the environment, we have a major communication problem."
"The environment, the economy and regional interests are constantly being played off against one another."
"This is where the big problem lies."
"We need support from the Commission to ensure that the environment is seen as an essential aspect of the economy."
"At the moment, far too little emphasis is being put on the fact that measures to protect the environment and the natural world can also create and safeguard jobs."
"Currently, the discussion is always polarised: either nature or jobs."
"We politicians have, unfortunately, also used this type of argument."
"I am calling on everyone to work on raising awareness and to acknowledge on both sides that we need to preserve the environment in order for the economy to continue functioning effectively in future."
"(CS) Madam President, Austria once voted against the nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf in order to get rid of a regional chancellor, and in doing so created a structure unique in Europe - a model atomic power plant built on a scale of 1:1."
"I would say that this was an expensive experiment and that the Austrians should not make anyone in Europe go down the same path."
"(DE) Madam President, I am actually happy with the response, but I would just like to have some clarification on one point."
"Under the current regulations, ski pistes only have to be included in the calculation of the thresholds when structural changes are planned during the development of the facility."
"All the other areas used by skiers, fare dodgers or other people do not come into consideration."
"I am of the opinion that the effects of using an area which has not been left in its natural state should be included."
"One final, brief point: in one area of a Member State which we, Mr Oettinger, are both very familiar with, the Committee on Petitions has the option in selected cases to apply a blocking procedure."
"I believe it would be a good thing for us to agree with the Commission and the Council that it is possible to put a freeze on proceedings if this is handled responsibly."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Wieland again, as he is a lawyer, whether he now wants to include the mountain hikers and the ski mountaineers, who wear skis and who sometimes use the ski lifts so that they do not have to cover the entire distance on foot, and also people using other sporting equipment."
"Will the whole Alpine region be subject to an environmental impact assessment?"
"He should define the criteria more accurately and explain exactly what he means."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to make one thing quite clear and to contradict the impression that has been given."
"The natural world is not the property of the conservation organisations."
"Nature is there to be used by the people."
"Therefore, as has just been touched on, I am not of the opinion that Damüls-Mellau is a case where this blocking procedure should have been applied."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, firstly, it must be clear to all of us that this case has not been handled correctly."
"However, the reappraisal of the case will help us to make progress within Europe."
"We have established that the thresholds were incorrectly applied, that no screening process was carried out and, therefore, that the environmental impact has not been assessed objectively enough."
"Secondly, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act in Austria needs to be amended or expanded to ensure that it corresponds with the European Union directives, in other words, with your requirements."
"Thirdly, we believe it is important that, when other measures are taken in this region, whether these are additional car parks or other developments, a special screening of the entire project is carried out which includes existing developed areas and existing building projects."
"You could say that the region is now under closer scrutiny."
"Anyone who enjoys skiing, as I do, will know that at around 15:00 in the afternoon in this region, noise pollution seems to be a bigger problem than damage to the natural environment."
"Of course, I do not mean that entirely seriously."
"The Commission now has the option of initiating an infringement procedure."
"We are not threatening to do this, but the option remains open to us."
"Then we need to look in general terms at the revision of the EIA Directive."
"What does Mr Potočnik have in mind?"
"Firstly, this is all about incorporating new policy objectives, such as climate change, biodiversity, energy, trans-European networks and cohesion policy."
"Secondly, the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which have resulted in an important clarification of the issue, must be included."
"In answer to Mr Lichtenberger's question, I would like to say that we have established that Austria's EIA Act now meets the threshold requirements."
"We are currently evaluating whether it is satisfactory in terms of transparency, civic participation and public consultation, both in form and in substance."
"I can confirm that Mr Potočnik, the Commissioner for the Environment, will provide you with a comprehensive written answer during the next few weeks about whether it corresponds with the transparency and civic participation requirements of our directive."
"I believe that this case and other findings will enable us to produce a satisfactory revision of the European directive next year."
"Mr Wieland asked how the definition of the area should be regarded."
"We will give you a written answer on this issue."
"I believe that when a transport facility is built, we should include not only the area of land under the cable, in other words, not just the route of the lift, which is one metre wide and several thousand metres long."
"On the other hand, the entire mountain should not be covered, although the fare dodgers are often the best skiers if they are on the black runs."
"However, from a more detailed perspective, all the areas designated as pistes must be included."
"In other words, any managed pistes and areas where snow making machines are used, in my opinion, belong to the developed area of the mountain and, therefore, have to fall within the threshold."
"If necessary, this should be clearly defined during the revision of the directive."
"How could we have influenced the process at an earlier stage?"
"These discussions are, of course, taking place relatively late in the day, five years after permission to build was granted."
"This is a fundamental problem because, under the terms of the Treaty, subsidiarity applies and the responsibility for implementing European law lies primarily with the Member States, which have to administer and enforce the law locally."
"I hope that in Austria in particular, lessons will have been learnt from this case about taking a sensitive approach when weighing up the interests of the economy and the environment and, therefore, that the case will have a positive impact in future."
"The debate is closed."
"Misleading business directories (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Erminia Mazzoni and Malcolm Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on misleading business directories (Ο-000087/2011 - Β7-0315/2011)."
"deputising for the author. - Madam President, two and a half years ago, I presented to this plenary a report on misleading business directories."
"The message that this Parliament gave was clear: that there is a serious problem with fraudulent practices by misleading business directories, that tens of thousands of our small businesses, voluntary organisations, and even charities, are falling victim to these fraudulent practices, and that we need a concerted approach to stop once and for all such deceptive practices."
"Two and a half years later, unfortunately, we are back here in plenary to discuss the same subject because there has been a serious lack of action to combat the problem of misleading business directories."
"This is not acceptable."
"Let me remind colleagues what we are talking about here."
"Basically, what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form, which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details, in return for what appears to be a free entry, a free listing in the business directory."
"At first glance, one does not notice any cost, any payment that might result from filling in this form."
"However, after submitting the form, victims receive a letter demanding payment of EUR 1 000 per year for three consecutive years."
"If they do not pay, the misleading business directories resort to what are essentially bullying tactics: harassing telephone calls, threats of legal action and pursuit by debt collectors."
"The most worrying thing is that such illegal tactics are being used under the very noses of the authorities of several Member States, who are well aware of these practices and have not taken any action to stop them."
"The European City Guide, Construct Data, TEMDI, EU Business Services, World Business Directory, Expo Guide and DAD are still operating unabated."
"The Commission has already stated that such misleading practices are against EU law, but it has not done enough to stop them."
"This is why we are here today."
"deputising for the author. - Madam President, the volume of complaints regarding misleading directory companies shows that this is a serious problem for SMEs."
"Rogue business directory companies are both inflicting financial damage and harassing small companies."
"In the period from 2003 to mid-2008, nearly 14 000 complaints and enquiries were documented."
"Hundreds of letters of complaint are still being received from new victims."
"The difficulties involved in tracking down activities of this nature undermine the very functioning of the Internal Market."
"Misleading practices are illegal under the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"But there is a lack of effective legal remedies and enforcement."
"The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, as the committee responsible for the legislation, has recently taken up this issue with the Dutch authorities, drawing their attention to fraudulent practices by a business directory company established in the Netherlands."
"The answer of the Dutch authorities clearly shows that Member States are mostly concerned about what happens in their own territory."
"I believe that given the cross-border nature of the problem, more cooperation between Member States on enforcement would also be absolutely crucial to stop the fraudulent practices."
"The Commission could itself take a more active role in working together with the Member States on cross-border enforcement using existing EU-wide networks to facilitate cooperation between the Member States."
"More emphasis should be placed on effective and dissuasive sanctions against such fraudulent practices in all Member States, which would put such directory companies out of business and enable those who run them to be punished."
"It should be envisaged to extend the scope for the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive to encompass all commercial practices in a business-to-consumer relationship, whether aiming at the protection of consumers or competitors."
"In that way, most if not all unfair business-to-business commercial practices in the retail sector would be covered and governed by the same set of rules as unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices, with which they generally overlap."
"It is also important to help businesses combat the scam by improving access to information and awareness raising by improving redress mechanisms."
"I wish to ask the Commissioner: what are the major obstacles for stronger involvement of state authorities in cross-border enforcement cooperation, and what measures does the Commission envisage in the fight against rogue directory companies?"
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns and misgivings and its critical analysis of this issue."
"The misleading practices of business directories are causing problems for numerous companies."
"Three years ago, we commissioned a survey and received thousands of complaints."
"We can only assume that this is just the tip of the iceberg, which means that the number of businesses that feel they have been misled could be many times greater."
"Mrs Reding, the Commissioner responsible for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, is currently collecting data in order to establish the scope of the problem."
"I want to emphasise the fact that practices of this kind are already banned under the terms of Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and of anti-fraud legislation in the various Member States."
"However, some of these fraudulent practices take place across national borders and are used in business transactions between different companies and, as things currently stand, it is difficult to prosecute the perpetrators."
"In order to address and resolve this problem, Mrs Reding plans to issue a communication by the end of the year which will report on the status of the implementation of the existing directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising and on the current opportunities for revising it and which will provide an evaluation of the situation."
"She is considering improving the content and looking at the conclusions to be drawn from misleading practices."
"She is also focusing on how the cooperation between the national authorities on the prosecution of cross-border cases can be improved."
"She also plans to propose that citizens and companies should be made more aware of the growing problem of misleading business directories and to highlight the need for more public relations activities in this area."
"The 2006 directive has been implemented by all the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has asked the Member States to inform us about the implementation and the measures they have taken and to submit a status report as soon as possible, before the planned communication is issued."
"This process was supported by a conference organised at the end of May by the Commission involving national authorities, interest groups and independent experts."
"The conference focused on the fraudulent practices of business directories and, in particular, cross-border activities."
"During the debate, it became clear that better and more systematic cooperation between the authorities in the Member States is needed and this will be incorporated into Mrs Reding's communication at the end of the year."
"I can assure you that we see this issue as being just as urgent as you do."
"This is why we want to take the next steps as quickly as possible."
"However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this."
"On the basis of the results of the consultation process and after examining all the arguments, the Commission intends to take further corrective measures to prevent misleading and illegal cross-border practices."
"Thank you very much for your broad support on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, no one could disagree with what you have said."
"I wish to relate the trouble suffered by a fellow Greek, who complained to me about a similar misadventure as the result of misleading advertising and gave me all the relevant documents."
"It says at the top of the letter sent out by the misleading company that the information is free of charge."
"Seeing that he had to enter certain information, my fellow countryman entered the information and sent off the letter."
"In tiny print at the bottom of the letter, it said, as Mr Busuttil said earlier, that he had to pay EUR 1 000 a year."
"Some time after that, the alleged legal department of the company sent out letters, which I have here, asking my fellow countryman to pay EUR 3 529.38, which apparently included interest and the company's legal costs."
"Commissioner, obviously, there is a legislative framework."
"However, we do not know if these directives are being applied and have been adequately transposed by the Member States."
"The Stockholm programme says that we need to address these issues directly."
"We stand next to our fellow citizens; we are involved in their day-to-day problems."
"Our fellow citizens need to understand that we are not in some far off place, that we do not deal only with major European issues."
"We are with them in their day-to-day lives."
"We need to resolve this issue immediately."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (SK) Madam President, it is clear, first and foremost, that these companies are not only misleading, but are also fraudulent."
"Entrepreneurship is meaningful insofar as it contributes to society as a whole, but if someone engages in pseudo-business in order to lure other, honest traders and companies to a directory purely for the sake of their own enrichment, and in doing so uses subterfuge, this is downright fraud, no matter how much they protest that they are not doing anything illegal."
"Nor should we lose sight of the fact that these directory company practices clearly are outside the law according to the directive on misleading and comparative advertising."
"Nevertheless, there is no need to introduce new legislation."
"Rather, we should be concentrating on applying the law in practice as quickly and effectively as possible."
"The problem is that these companies often swoop on undertakings in another EU Member State, and these frequently small family businesses either do not have the knowledge or the ability to put up a legal defence, or find that it will cost them a lot of money and effort."
"I have only one additional question: does the Commission believe there is scope for a public campaign to name the individual companies involved and call on honest business not to associate with them?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would say to the Commissioner that over the last number of years, I have met many Irish citizens who have been victims of misleading business directory companies."
"For example, I met a school secretary who paid over EUR 2 000 because the school could not afford to pay it as she felt responsible because she had signed the form."
"She also felt very foolish."
"She thought nobody could be so stupid as to do what she had done, not realising of course that this happens to people all the time."
"I met an elderly lady whose husband was a taxi driver."
"She received a form on which there were some errors."
"She merely thought she was correcting the errors, sent the form back and subsequently received threatening letters for two years."
"She was terrorised by those letters to the extent that she was afraid to open the letter when it arrived at her door."
"I could not tell her not to pay the money."
"All I could say was that if I were in her position, I would not pay the money."
"That was the best advice I could give her."
"There are lots of other examples, which I know you have heard."
"The truth is that citizens expect to be protected by European legislation and they cannot understand why European legislation does not protect them in this respect."
"There is an ambiguity here."
"As I said, I tell citizens that I believe that they are protected, but I cannot guarantee it."
"It is my understanding, for example, that one of these companies was convicted in one region of Spain, and yet all it did was simply move to another region and continue its work."
"One of the matters that concerns citizens is that they are not sure of how legal systems operate in other countries."
"They may feel that within their own Member State they will be protected, but they are not sure what happens in another Member State."
"Equally, if these companies move outside the EU, they also have concerns about that."
"It is good to hear, therefore, that the Commission shares our concern and that it is pushing for cooperation between Member States and again looking at cross-border cases and trying to inform citizens and companies."
"Commissioner, you said the situation was urgent, but it has been urgent for a very, very long time."
"Citizens see many areas where EU legislation impacts on their lives, and so they cannot understand why they are not protected from fraudulent companies."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, to understand that the word 'urgent' means 'now'."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I absolutely agree with what Mrs Harkin has just said."
"In my constituency in Scotland, it is the elderly and people who run bed-and-breakfast establishments or self-catering holiday cottages that fall foul of this criminal activity."
"They enter addresses into this directory and then receive a bill for a thousand euro."
"The elderly are terrified when they get these threatening letters from the supposedly legal representatives of these companies."
"This is a cross-border criminal activity."
"These companies give their identities and they give their addresses."
"We have to track them down, close them down, prosecute them and protect the citizens of the European Union."
"When any member of the public contacts me in my constituency, I simply say to them to write back to the company and tell it to send all future correspondence to me."
"They never hear another thing."
"However, these people must also be imprisoned."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, this motion is badly needed."
"Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should."
"The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets."
"Using tactics like those of bully-boys and racketeers, they dangle promises in front of unsuspecting people, but I think the message has got to be that if an offer seems to be too good to be true, then most probably it is."
"These companies are like predatory sharks and they should be stopped."
"Certainly, our group welcomes this resolution, it is very timely and we will be supporting it, as it calls on the Commission to require Member States to adequately enforce the directive."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues."
"In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force."
"They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service."
"So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback."
"The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints."
"More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe?"
"The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers."
"The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can summarise in figures the situation regarding misleading business directories that are supposed to be free."
"Four hundred petitions have been sent to the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions."
"Fifty thousand very small businesses, associations or organisations have been affected and harassed into paying."
"An average of EUR 1 000 is required to be paid over three years for unwanted contracts, as Mr Busuttil has already mentioned."
"These figures only partly reflect the suffering of the victims of these scams."
"These people are already taking risks by starting up their company, and quickly have to face the challenges of business, the economic crisis and the uncertainties of the future."
"We must prevent them from being subjected to these fraudulent practices, which they do not have the financial or human resources to resist."
"Several proposals are possible: firstly, we must put a stop to these scams that are weakening our economy."
"To do so, Commissioner, it would be advisable to speed up the revision of the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive, in light of the fact that fraudulent advertising is increasing and becoming more sophisticated."
"We should then create a blacklist of these companies, serving as a reference based on the principle of 'naming and shaming'."
"With help from the national authorities responsible for fighting fraud and from the affected businesses, we could have a simple and effective tool for deterrence and prevention."
"Finally, we must severely punish those involved in this system."
"The penalties and fines incurred are often lower than the amounts collected in these scams."
"We should encourage Member States to be stricter in this area."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns."
"This is very nice, but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area."
"We have Mr Busuttil's report in front of us."
"In the last parliamentary term, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection repeatedly highlighted the fact that we finally need to do something to help people."
"The problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive."
"Many of the small voluntary organisations that are affected do not have the financial means or the chutzpah to defend themselves."
"Only last week I received another letter asking: 'How can I defend myself?"
"I do not have the money for a lawyer, so I cannot take legal proceedings'."
"I believe that we must finally give the citizens of Europe an effective means of ridding themselves of this problem."
"Madam President, dodgy scams, which are fraudulent in nature and prey on small businesses using a veil of legitimacy - often with Europe in their titles - must be made illegal."
"These scams do not just damage small businesses, which are threatened, harassed and bullied into paying fees for something they believed to be free; they damage the European Union when we do not take firm action to help."
"It is the mantra of the European Commission, after all, to 'think small first', yet I have been raising this issue, as many colleagues have said, for many, many years, and yet no direct action has been taken: why not?"
"We hear about surveys, information gatherings, and stakeholder meetings."
"We need action not words, and if we say that we will only wait to the end of this year, or give it another few years, then that is just too little too late: we must act now."
"So, given the nature of these scams and their EU-wide and cross-border nature, will the Commission consider introducing a form of legal aid to assist SMEs in tackling these scams?"
"These types of scams will continue until the Commission takes tough action."
"Madam President, the European Parliament has received hundreds of petitions from small businesses across the EU who claim to have fallen victim to these schemes."
"While paying these outrageous fees may put innocent companies under severe financial hardship, the victims are often too small to afford the legal costs of bringing actions against these directory companies."
"These companies often target victims that are based in another Member State."
"This creates legal uncertainty for the victims, as they often do not know what the legal status is of such contracts in another country."
"The directory companies play on that uncertainty."
"Whilst the Commission has clearly stated that the directive on misleading and comparative advertising outlaws the misleading practices of these directory companies, it must also look at the transposing of that directive by the Member States in order to clarify whether citizens are protected equally across Europe."
"The fact that this directive has been transposed by Member States does not necessarily mean that these measures are either comprehensive or in conformity with one another."
"(EL) Madam President, unfair commercial practices are like water."
"As soon as they find a crack, in they go."
"They have found two cracks here."
"One crack is the 2006 directive, which has already been mentioned; the other crack is the regulation on cooperation between the Member States."
"Commissioner, as you have the support of all the factions in Parliament, of the entire Parliament, you should act quickly, because time is money."
"As my fellow Members have already said, at least three years have passed, three years during which these people, these hustlers, as they have rightly been called by numerous fellow Members - and I am with them - are misleading colleagues and are misleading small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy."
"You need to act and to act quickly."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed vital to know whether the directive on misleading and comparative advertising has been properly transposed and applied in the Member States."
"However, we must also quickly and fully address other fundamental aspects of this problem, which can also be applied to other forms of cross-border scams."
"Firstly, the Commission, Member States and their organisations must provide consumers with information upstream."
"It is unacceptable that more and more citizens are being scammed."
"Secondly, victims should have access to class actions in order to assert their rights."
"We have been waiting for these actions for over 20 years."
"Thirdly, the current discussion on the reform of alternative dispute resolutions could also include provisions to deal with these scams."
"Commissioner, we expect you to take swift and concrete measures in this regard."
"Madam President, the position is exactly as colleagues have pointed out."
"I know this because in my own constituency, particularly in Cork, a company called the European City Guide has been fraudulently engaging with businesses all over the place."
"Despite the fact that, as I understand it, it was asked to cease trading by the high court in Catalonia in 2001 and was found to be guilty of misleading practices in the Belgian courts and by the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading, it continues to trade."
"This is not good enough."
"It is very important that we do two things: firstly, we have to try and raise awareness amongst businesses right across Europe to ensure they are vigilant and do not fall foul of these misleading companies and, secondly, we have to bring in legislation that ensures that, when they are taken to court, they either cease trading or are put behind bars."
"It is as simple as that."
"(CS) Madam President, Parliament has received over 400 petitions, and I myself have received many complaints from businesses, non-profit organisations, schools, charities and even government institutions which have become victims of the fraud perpetrated by business directory companies."
"They make costly financial commitments in the belief that they are updating their information."
"The operations of rogue directory companies are deliberately managed across borders or from third countries."
"We need a clear pan-European solution, but the European Commission, which holds the legislative initiative, has done nothing for years, despite all the efforts of the European Parliament."
"In my role as shadow rapporteur, I have put forward numerous solutions in Parliament's report."
"In reality, all the Commission need do is propose blacklisting these prohibited deceptive advertising practices under the relevant directive."
"We need a robust European legislative solution, and we need it quickly."
"I urge the Commission to apply the accelerated legislative procedure."
"Many honest citizens have lost a lot of money because of the Commission's blameworthy laxity in this case."
"In my opinion, a Europol investigation is also warranted."
"(CS) Madam President, the unfair practices of some of these so-called business directory companies continue to pose a serious problem."
"Their operations always rely primarily on circumventions of the law and on very poor law enforcement."
"Many entities are deterred from taking legal action by the cost."
"Conversely, there have been many instances of absurd judgments based on the formalistic approach taken by judicial and other supervisory bodies."
"What these swindlers mostly rely on, however, is the poor level of legal knowledge among the institutions responsible and, regrettably, their lack of willingness and courage in many cases, and a certain indolence."
"Their formalistic interpretation of the law allows them to avoid getting involved, to avoid prosecuting these cases, and to wash their hands of them."
"Paradoxically, it is then the swindlers' interests that are protected rather than their victims."
"The question put to the Commission rightly asks how the Member States approach this issue."
"How have they applied the directive on misleading and comparative advertising?"
"Unless the state plays an active and not just a formal role, this problem will remain truly intractable and the petitions from defrauded victims will accumulate."
"And yet we are not powerless in this matter."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) strongly supports the move to free small and medium-sized businesses from the menace of business directories, which allegedly provide a service for these companies, but which ultimately do not have any real consequences except invoices."
"However, as you, Mr Oettinger, have rightly said, Directive 2006/114/EC provides a legal basis for this which has obviously not been successfully implemented in some Member States."
"Therefore, I hope that the Commission will tackle the root of the problem and take a systematic approach to resolving it as quickly as possible in the Member States where the situation is particularly bad."
"Of course, because of the cross-border nature of the entries, the problem can spill over from these Member States into other neighbouring countries."
"A broad-brush approach will not work in this case because it is clear that the problem lies with certain Member States."
"(RO) Madam President, business directories are one of the most widely used sources of information about the offerings available in a particular business sector."
"They enjoy a high standing among European consumers thanks to their prestige."
"This is why misleading business directories cause harm to the people who use them."
"This practice can be ended by implementing the directive on misleading and comparative advertising properly."
"Unfortunately, not all Member States have transposed this text into their legislation."
"This means that the victims cannot be compensated for the harm they have suffered."
"Revising the directive would provide the instruments needed to combat this practice."
"Supplementing EU legislation with specific provisions would also limit the appearance of misleading business directories."
"I think that the victims of these practices must have the opportunity to have direct recourse to the justice system."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this is really a European problem."
"Everyone is familiar with these cases and we are hearing stories from a number of different countries."
"I have a whole stack of these cases on my desk and I admit that I would have fallen for most of them."
"The problem is, and we have covered this on numerous occasions, we have Directive 2006/114/EC, we discussed the matter in 2008 in the Committee on Petitions, and we have held debates here in plenary, but the problem is continuing and even growing in size."
"Mr Oettinger, I heard what you said at the beginning and I have the impression that the problem has landed with you."
"Perhaps a new Commissioner will have a new opportunity to take action in this area."
"I would like to ask you to take the problem seriously."
"It may seem to be a small problem, but it has a serious economic impact and it affects small, medium-sized and family-run companies in particular and they form the backbone of our national economies and our society."
"If we do not succeed in stopping this in all the Member States and in implementing the directive uniformly and effectively throughout Europe, even greater damage will be caused."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, I am grateful for the wide-ranging and consistent description of the situation given by the committed Members who are here today."
"I will inform Mrs Reding about this and encourage her to draw up a comprehensive communication covering the strengths and the weaknesses of current European and national law and to revise the directive on this basis."
"It is clear that the 2006 directive has been implemented by the Member States."
"Therefore, this is not primarily a problem of adapting national law."
"Firstly, in the event of cross-border problems, the law is often not even applied in many cases, as a result of the less than ideal cooperation between the authorities in the different Member States, and, therefore, these cases are not investigated at all."
"Secondly, there is often a failure to prosecute."
"Criminal law is a matter for the Member States, both in terms of setting penalties and of formal investigations of these cases by the authorities, public prosecutors or the courts."
"Thirdly, and now I am coming to the heart of the matter, the 2006 directive only covers unfair practices in business dealings between businesses and consumers and not between one business and another."
"This means that it mainly provides protection for private citizens against these fraudulent companies."
"It does not protect citizens who are entrepreneurs, sole traders, retailers, businesspeople and tradesmen or who own small or medium-sized businesses against this type of fraud."
"However, it is precisely this point, extending the scope of the directive to include business dealings between companies, which was opposed by the majority of the Member States during the legislative process at the time."
"This means that we quite deliberately restricted ourselves on the basis of this directive to European regulation of dealings between fraudulent companies and citizens and not between fraudulent companies and small businesses."
"European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time."
"The directive was an ambitious European project and, at the time, the Commission was concerned that the whole proposal would be sabotaged and that there would be no directive at all if it had insisted on extending the directive beyond the relationship between fraudsters and citizens."
"In the light of the specific examples you have mentioned here and the cases of abuse uncovered by the Commission, it may be possible to broaden the scope of the directive beyond the relationship between fraudulent companies and citizens in the revision which is due to take place next year."
"We will start work on this immediately."
"Finally, there are Member States which have satisfactory provisions under substantive and criminal law covering the relationship between fraudsters and citizens and which prosecute cases of this kind. Good examples include Austria, Belgium and France."
"There are other Member States, and you have referred to some of them here, where the national regulations are not adequate."
"We must wait and see whether these Member States will be prepared in the Council in a year's time to vote in favour of a general, EU-wide, standardised regulation to protect citizens who are also businesspeople."
"I have received one motion for a resolution from the Committee on Petitions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The problem is real, unfortunately very widespread and can be observed almost across the whole European Union."
"The victims sign a contract in good faith to be advertised in a business directory after having been led to believe that this would be free of charge."
"Then the operators require payment on different grounds, and continuously harass, put under psychological stress and even threaten with legal action those who do not pay up."
"A review as to whether the corresponding Union law is effectively implemented by Member States is inevitable in order to avoid further misleading advertising and, if necessary, a new amendment of the relevant Union law should be proposed in order to solve the current problem."
"The most important thing now is to demonstrate to the enterprises in trouble that we not only understand their plight but also fully support them."
"At the same time, it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities, because they are contrary to the spirit of the Union's competition policy."
"Stress tests of nuclear power plants in EU and nuclear safety in EU neighbourhood countries (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on stress tests of nuclear power plants in EU and nuclear safety in EU neighbouring countries."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, following numerous meetings with various parliamentary committees, I can report to you today on the progress of our ambitious plan to introduce a Europe-wide stress test for nuclear power stations in the European Union and in other countries."
"We proposed to the Council that the safety of all the nuclear power stations in the EU should be investigated on the basis of a comprehensive risk and safety evaluation and the Council reached a decision on this at the end of March."
"The European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Commission were asked to draw up the criteria, the methodology and the timeframe for carrying out the stress tests."
"This was not an easy process and we received comments of all kinds on our efforts."
"I can tell you today that we now have in place the test criteria, the methodology and the timeframe, which, in my opinion, will meet the expectations of European citizens with regard to this stress test."
"(Heckling from Mr Turmes)"
"Simply saying 'Rubbish' is not an argument, Mr Turmes."
"'Rubbish' is not a word that we like to see in the Minutes, but if it makes you happy, then I will accept it."
"In any case, we had a tough struggle."
"Firstly, many of the nuclear safety regulators were not prepared to agree to a European inspection procedure."
"This is because the energy mix is a matter for the Member States and because the monitoring, authorisation and supervision of nuclear power plants also falls within the remit of the Member States."
"I believe that the fact that we are carrying out a stress test at a European level with joint criteria is an extremely important and historic step forwards in the interest of the safety of all European citizens."
"I can assure you that I will not allow a watered-down version of the stress test to be used."
"When the outcome of the stress test is presented to the public, with all the results, evaluations, proposals and conclusions, the citizens of Europe will know more about European nuclear power stations in all the Member States than they have done despite all the efforts made over past decades."
"I remember very well how people living in areas close to national borders wanted to find out about the safety features of nearby nuclear power stations."
"This was often very unsatisfactory from the perspective of the citizens."
"In six or nine months, we will have significantly more data, facts and findings at our disposal than have been made public over the last twenty years."
"The stress test consists of three stages."
"(Heckling from Mrs Harms)"
"Given the early hour, let us take a serious approach this morning, Mrs Harms."
"Please trust me to remain objective."
"When we discuss this subject, I feel as if I am being criticised by both sides."
"As the worldly-wise person in the middle, I know I am in the right place."
"I said 'in the middle', Mrs Harms."
"I did not say anything about mediocrity."
"Please listen carefully."
"I believe that my position will meet your expectations when it comes to objectivity."
"Stage 1: In a market economy, the main responsibility of the owners and operators of industrial plants is undoubtedly to ensure themselves that their facilities are safe, to carry out regular safety inspections and to report the results."
"For this reason, during the first stage, every operator of a nuclear power plant has been asked since 1 June to submit a report to the national authorities using the agreed European inspection criteria, our inspection catalogue, which is public and transparent."
"The reports must be submitted quickly, but they must be thorough, and thoroughness is more important than speed."
"They must include the operators' evaluation of their own nuclear power plant and the conclusions drawn by the operators on the basis of the inspection criteria and the consequences of Fukushima."
"Stage 2: This consists of another review by the national nuclear safety regulators of the reports produced by the operators and an evaluation of the regulators' own inspections and findings."
"Stage 3 is new and is made up of peer reviews."
"During the third stage, we intend to gain our own picture of the situation, make our own evaluation and draw our own conclusions at a European level."
"We will not be sitting in our ivory tower and we will not be naively accepting the results provided by the national authorities."
"We will be using mixed European teams and we will have the option of visiting the nuclear power plants ourselves."
"The European teams will be made up of nuclear experts from the various Member States and Commission officials."
"Every step, in particular, in the context of the peer reviews, can only be taken on the basis of agreement between the Commission and ENSREG, which means that without the Commission's agreement, the process cannot be completed."
"This is why I can assure you that a serious, objective and thorough approach is very important to me."
"Everything that happens will be transparent."
"Only in cases where security interests require confidentiality will a lower level of transparency be permitted."
"I believe that the test criteria cover the main expectations and legitimate interests of the public in Europe."
"They include all natural phenomena, such as high water, extremes of heat and cold, earthquakes and other things. They involve all the nature-related risks."
"Secondly, I am more convinced than ever that although the starting point of the Fukushima disaster was a natural event, this was not the sole cause of the disaster."
"In my opinion, human failure played a significant if not a decisive role in Japan before the earthquake and the tsunami, when it came to improving safety and modernising the plant, and after the disaster with regard to keeping the damage to a minimum."
"This is why for me the human factor was an important component of the stress test."
"At first, I was not given adequate support on this issue by the nuclear regulators."
"I am grateful that Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were behind me."
"For this reason, I incorporated their expectations into the negotiations."
"We have ensured that the human factor is widely represented in the test criteria."
"I would like to make a very specific distinction here."
"We have made sure that the human factor and human failure are fully covered in the test criteria."
"By this we mean an error, a lack of qualifications, poor management of a nuclear power station or a pilot error leading to an aircraft crashing."
"This means that human issues and human failure are fully represented in the stress test."
"(Heckling from Mr Turmes)"
"Mr Turmes, you seem to believe that you can run the parliamentary proceedings with your heckling."
"Please allow me to finish what I have to say."
"You will have enough speaking time afterwards."
"(Applause and heckling)"
"I would like to explain to the honourable Member that this subject is so important that I should have at least seven to eight minutes speaking time."
"Anyway, they are your Rules of Procedure."
"If you want more speaking time, Parliament itself can decide on this."
"You are a Member of Parliament and I am not."
"The subject of human error is fully covered."
"However, one area which was not included is crime."
"By this I mean that deliberate attacks on nuclear power stations, perhaps by terrorists, in whatever form, including cyber attacks and attacks by aircraft, do not form part of the stress test."
"There are two reasons for this."
"The first is purely formal."
"The nuclear safety regulators in many of the Member States are not technically responsible for this area and referred the Commission to the responsibilities of the secret service, the police, the air force, the army and the domestic authorities."
"Therefore, we will now invite the Member States to send representatives from the relevant authorities to us so that we can discuss with these authorities before the summer recess how we can incorporate the consequences of crime."
"The second reason is that the Member States raised the issue of confidentiality and put forward strong arguments in support of this, which meant that the discussions could not be transparent."
"We want to submit an interim report in November."
"I will be happy to enter into further formal discussions with Parliament before the peer review takes place."
"There is one point which we need to be clear about: thoroughness is more important than speed."
"I do not agree with the short timeframe which some Member States felt was adequate for the special tests."
"I do not believe that we can do justice to the test criteria that are so important to us in the space of four to six weeks."
"Therefore, we may need a period which runs into spring of next year."
"As far as other issues are concerned, please remember that I am not concerned with the question of whether nuclear power stations are being operated, planned, constructed or shut down."
"That is the responsibility of the Member States according to my understanding of the law."
"However, I do feel that I am responsible for safety both with regard to power stations that are in operation and those that are being planned."
"For this reason, I am grateful that our invitation was accepted on a working level and that Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland, Armenia, Croatia and Turkey agreed to take the next step of a joint European stress test, which will allow a safety investigation to be carried out beyond the borders of the European Union."
"I look forward to reporting the results to you as soon as possible."
"In addition, I would like to explain that I will also be concerned over the next few months with drawing up strict and objective legal regulations governing nuclear waste."
"I was rather surprised that the committee did not categorically exclude the possibility of exporting waste to third countries by a large majority."
"(Heckling)"
"I would like to explain to the honourable Member that I am here in my role of Commissioner."
"My party membership is a private matter."
"Please make a distinction between Mr Oettinger, the former Christian Democrat, and Commissioner Oettinger."
"Therefore, I can say as a Commissioner that I was surprised that restrictions were imposed on export bans by a clear majority."
"Perhaps it would still be possible to change this during the process of reaching a parliamentary decision by the end of June."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr Oettinger, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Mr Oettinger."
"In contrast to those people whose fine words just cause uncertainty, you have made sure that something actually happens."
"That is what makes a difference in politics."
"It is really starting to get on my nerves, to be quite blunt about it, that some Members of Parliament are constantly demanding more and more, but are not prepared to make a contribution themselves."
"Mrs Harms, we have failed in Parliament."
"We did not even manage to adopt a resolution on the subject of safety because you wanted 150% and were not satisfied with what was actually possible as a result of the various responsibilities involved."
"We have not done our job and neither have you."
"However, the Commissioner has done his job."
"Six months ago, we would not have expected to have the opportunity to carry out a stress test of this kind. We would never have believed that it would be possible to enter into discussions with states outside Europe on the subject of safety."
"It is easy to go around shouting about how dreadful everything is and focusing solely on the question of the exit from nuclear power, in other words, all or nothing."
"It is more difficult but more beneficial for the people of Europe to make progress in this area."
"What Mr Oettinger has achieved over the last few months is an example to us all."
"I am not trying to say that everything is exactly how we wanted it."
"We will only be able to tell at the end if this is what we wanted."
"Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, it is simply not acceptable to spend your time permanently complaining and heckling and then, when you are called on to do something, to vote against better safety levels for nuclear power plants."
"The resolution was here on the table and you voted against it."
"You weakened the position of Parliament and of the Commission, when we wanted to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations."
"That is a fact."
"I have had enough of this constant hypocrisy."
"It is dishonest and it does not allow us to make progress."
"Of course the situation is complicated, but everyone is familiar with the legal position."
"It is naïve to believe that we can do what we want."
"There is a very specific legal position which we have to follow."
"The things that have been achieved here within that framework are very interesting and important."
"You may think that the endless heckling is funny, but it does not get us anywhere."
"(Applause)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Reul, I will explain in my speech later why we are not satisfied, but I have the impression that you have not yet properly digested what your Chancellor and your party in Germany have now decided."
"(DE) Madam President, once again, all this was obviously not about moving forward one millimetre or three metres on this subject, but about party political disputes."
"We can do this."
"We made much more progress on this resolution in Parliament across all the party boundaries than we have done now."
"For me, it is highly regrettable that we are once again fighting over the question of yes or no."
"You know that I personally hold a very individual view on this issue but I have been prepared to compromise and to find common ground in Parliament in order to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations in their current locations, which is where they are likely to stay."
"It is our job to achieve results for the people of Europe and not just to make explanations."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Reul, I take seriously your call for objectivity and honesty in our dealings with one another."
"Therefore, I would like to ask why you sound so aggressive and why you are accusing the Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance of hypocrisy."
"You have used the ridiculous argument that a year ago, it would not have been possible to push through a stress test of this kind."
"However, you did not explain to Parliament that the only reason that this was not possible was because you, Mr Reul, and those on your side prevented it."
"We had this problem before Fukushima."
"If we all want safety, then the right thing to do is to show a permanent commitment to safety and not just when there has been a core meltdown in three reactors."
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, the reason why I reacted so strongly is that I am still annoyed that we have not managed to adopt a joint resolution on safety, because it was more important for some people to take up an absolutist position rather than to find common ground."
"Secondly, I explained during the debate and I will explain once again that I have learned a lesson from this."
"I now realise that we need to do more to introduce tougher safety standards for European nuclear power stations."
"We need to exert more pressure and show more initiative."
"This is why I supported the joint resolution and this is why I am in favour of supporting Mr Oettinger and not constantly attacking him."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would like to say to Mr Reul that there was a time when power from unsafe nuclear plants was considered to be dirty and not to be bought by responsible EU states."
"Those nuclear plants that are now intended to be built on the EU's eastern borders belong to that exact category as their technology has not been experimented with before in more distant places."
"The assurances that they will be safe are only empty assurances."
"What does he think if Germany, refusing to build nuclear plants on its own territory, accepts their being built at our borders and buys this 'dirty' power?"
"What kind of a picture of solidarity and morals is that?"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Landsbergis, I am sorry, but I cannot answer the question."
"I cannot speak on behalf of the German Government."
"However, I believe that you are right when you say that not only must we deal carefully with the subject of the safety of European nuclear power stations, but that we must also take responsibility for influencing the construction and the condition of other power stations, in as far as we can."
"Mr Oettinger has said that he is making every effort to promote the stress tests and possible changes in the directives in other areas of the world and is committed to ensuring that these higher safety standards are adopted."
"In this respect, I think that your remarks are justified."
"Madam President, Mr Reul, you are the chair of the committee."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us all calm down a little."
"Commissioner, in the meeting that we had on the day before your meeting with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), my group explained to you what our position on this question was."
"Now I must tell you we are not totally satisfied."
"Why is this?"
"This is so because we believe that the stress tests should have been made obligatory."
"However, we are pleased to hear that the 143 European nuclear plants are going to be subject to the stress tests, and we also support the Commission in its efforts to persuade third countries to re-evaluate their plants as well."
"Furthermore, we are not satisfied because we believe that stress tests, which, in fact, are going to be carried out by the operators themselves, should be subjected to a second opinion in order to ensure greater objectivity."
"The peer review method, involving seven experts, is one step."
"However, our group's proposal was to create an independent control mechanism which was supposed to operate from the outset and not in the later results analysis phase."
"We also think that the tests should be carried out on other facilities, such as research reactors, and in respect of other threats, such as the fallout from a terrorist attack or a plant's structural weaknesses."
"We are conscious of the competition issues that have arisen but we think that a better agreement could have been reached."
"Carrying out a risk analysis now is an appropriate but isolated measure."
"Therefore, to guarantee maximum safety, my group proposes that an independent organisation be created at a European level that would assume responsibility for safety and control."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say to you that what we hope for now is consistency, so that reactors that do not pass the tests and that cannot remedy their deficiencies are closed, and transparency, so that all citizens have complete information about the test procedure and results."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, this is not an internal German issue, but a European issue."
"It is vital that nuclear facilities across Europe are both safe and seen to be safe."
"The mistakes of the first banking stress test must therefore not be repeated; we do not need another pointless PR exercise."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission to make sure that the stress tests are conducted in a solid, transparent and comprehensive manner and that they have real consequences."
"If a plant fails the test and if the issues raised cannot be remedied, it should be shut down."
"The proposed stress tests are, however, too weak."
"The ALDE Group has called for the entire safety culture and the human factor to be included in the test."
"This is unfortunately not the case."
"I sincerely hope that the Commission finds another way forward to test the safety culture."
"For instance, I expect the Commission to put forward proposals as part of the revision of the nuclear safety directive to remedy these problems."
"This includes the issues that you raised, Commissioner, of security in respect of decommissioning and waste."
"The stress test also lacks clear wording on the need for the independence and transparency of the tests."
"There will be a peer review, with representatives from Member States other than the one where the concerned nuclear plant is situated, but they will not necessarily be fully independent."
"That is a problem."
"These are all problems for the credibility of the tests, but the stress tests are only the beginning."
"We need a strategy which goes beyond this and that provides European common standards guaranteeing a high level of nuclear safety and information."
"The safety of nuclear power plants is a European issue."
"Looking ahead, we should implement stricter safety standards than the International Atomic Energy Agency recommendations and the rest of the world."
"If you look at the information and the transparency in the Fukushima accident, there is a real need for a European platform and for European regulation on this issue."
"European citizens expect and deserve the best possible safety for their nuclear power plants."
"There is precious little time and there is a heavy responsibility on the European Commission, and certainly more now on the Member States, who are weakening and backing off from what they promised initially after what happened in Japan."
"We ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and we ask the Council, which is not here, to meet the expectations of the European citizens when it comes to nuclear safety in Europe."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to share with you some extracts from the interim report of the UK Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations: 'we all need to adhere to the principal of continuous improvement."
"That means that, no matter how high the standards of nuclear design and subsequent operation are, the quest for improvement should never stop'."
"The UK nuclear regulatory system is largely non-prescriptive."
"That means that the industry must demonstrate to the regulator that it fully understands the hazards associated with its operations and knows how to control them."
"So we expect the industry to take the prime responsibility for learning lessons, rather than relying on the regulator to tell it what to do."
"Conclusion number one reads: 'in considering the direct causes of the Fukushima accident, we see no reason for curtailing the operation of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities in the UK'."
"Conclusion two reads: 'in response to the Fukushima accident, the UK nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately, displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date'."
"Conclusion four reads: 'to date, the consideration of the known circumstances of the Fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the UK'."
"In conclusion, let us remember the extraordinary nature of the earthquake and the strength of the tsunami that hit the Fukushima installation and which has started all this process."
"Madam President, Mr Oettinger, so far, the debate has gone as I expected it to, but not as I wanted it to."
"Initially after Fukushima, you moved in the right direction and set yourself objectives which included a comprehensive, in-depth investigation of all the risks presented by European nuclear power stations on the basis of what we had learnt at the time from Fukushima."
"Now we know even more about Fukushima, including the fact that the disaster was systematically played down and that the core meltdowns occurred much earlier than the Japanese admitted."
"We also know about the problems in the monitoring systems."
"However, today you have made a big mistake."
"As a Commissioner who is taking over a responsibility which he does not have, you should have said: 'Mrs Harms, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have taken on a big task, but I have only made a small amount of progress'."
"You should have referred to the fact that there are major problems, that the stress tests are purely voluntary, that they are only being carried out on paper and that they are largely in the hands of the operators, which is where they always have been."
"You should have admitted this and then I would have been able to take you more seriously."
"In that case, we could have had further useful discussions about what has and has not been achieved."
"What you have presented us with, Mr Oettinger, is basically a strategy which will help to play down the risks involved in the European nuclear power programme as it currently stands."
"At some point, there will be a sort of Oettinger seal of approval on the old reactors which will certify that tests have once again been carried out on paper of all the things that have often been tested before."
"You really have little to say on the subject of safety and we have not moved much further on from that."
"Because of the Euratom Treaty, Parliament has almost no influence over nuclear safety and we have not made any progress in that area."
"I will be interested to see how the debate about genuine common safety standards goes."
"This is what we will judge you on again."
"However, that is in the future and what we have achieved so far is extremely poor."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable lady for accepting my question."
"I have two questions."
"Would you first of all accept that this is not just a German debate and that there are other elements to this discussion?"
"Because it has seemed to be rather an internal German discussion and there are different views about this."
"Secondly, would you not accept that the circumstances faced by Fukushima were quite extraordinary and unprecedented, both in terms of the strength of the earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - and the height of the tsunami, which reached a maximum, I am told, of 46 metres, and had an average height of 14 metres, conditions that we might not expect in Europe?"
"(DE) Madam President, I beg your pardon, Mr Chichester, I was speaking German, but I said absolutely nothing in my speech about Germany."
"If I were to say anything about Germany, it would be this: I believe it is right that the German Government, under the leadership of climate policy expert Klaus Töpfer, for example, has said that the risks involved in these power stations are too great, that in the case of a disaster, the risks would be unmanageable and that this is why Germany is getting out of nuclear power."
"I believe it is important to mention this here from a German perspective."
"However, I said nothing about this in my previous speech."
"Secondly, I would like to say on the subject of Japan that TEPCO and other operators of nuclear power plants maintained before Fukushima that their plants were technically equipped to withstand all the types of earthquake that were likely to occur."
"There were forecasts and warnings that there would be a horror tsunami of this kind. I do not understand why the International Atomic Energy Agency did not intervene earlier."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to ask you, Mrs Harms, why you have not thanked Mr Oettinger."
"Why did you not say thank you?"
"I think the accusations that you have made against him here are outrageous."
"Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities."
"Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years, with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level."
"I believe it is unfair for you to continue following your own green policy without taking any responsibility."
"(DE) Madam President, I remember very well a remark made publicly by Mr Oettinger who said that he knew that certain plants in the European Union would have to be disconnected from the grid as a result of the stress tests."
"I then asked him which plants he was referring to."
"I am waiting for him to follow up on what he said."
"I remember that Mr Oettinger said during the last plenary session that he would not sign the document that was currently on the table concerning stress tests."
"He did sign it, despite the fact that very few changes were made in terms of quality."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, would not Ms Harms accept that her position and the position of her group is that they are not interested in the stress tests: they are not interested in any objective evidence at all."
"Their objective is to close down the nuclear industry and they have a fixed objective."
"Would she not admit that this is actually true?"
"(DE) Madam President, as we currently have no nuclear power stations where, in the case of a core meltdown, the effects could be restricted to the reactor, I am of the opinion that we should get out of nuclear power."
"I am happy to admit that openly."
"It is not a secret."
"My second point is that right from the beginning, we have been fully committed and we are still committed to genuine technical inspections of existing plants which focus on the well-known safety problems."
"We very much regret the fact that this will not be happening."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this Parliament have campaigned for the introduction of high, mandatory safety standards."
"Mrs Niebler knows why we failed and why we currently have no high, mandatory safety standards in Europe today."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, since Chernobyl, for acute personal reasons, I have been a very committed opponent of nuclear energy plants."
"After Fukushima, the first victims there were the workers and the firemen."
"So as an obedient, committed citizen against nuclear plants, I have submitted a Written Declaration for an expression of solidarity for the heroic efforts of Fukushima - the workers and the firemen - and I was really very surprised to see that up till now, we do not have even one signature from your Group."
"How committed are you?"
"At the first step of paying our tribute ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, I am happy for us to talk about this again, but I have a very big problem."
"I think what has been done about the nuclear hell that has emerged in Japan is magnificent."
"I have often visited Chernobyl, including the exclusion zone."
"I believe what the workers in this dangerous zone are still doing today is magnificent."
"The people who we have turned into heroes are fighting for pensions, for health care and for other things decades after they became heroes."
"It is easy to talk about heroism, but genuinely dealing with the consequences is another and much sadder story."
"Madam President, on a point of order, we are holding a debate now with the Commissioner, not a debate amongst ourselves and amongst the political groups."
"I think, under the Rules, we have one blue card and not six or seven."
"With your agreement, I shall interrupt the blue-card procedure because there are another three requests."
"For my part, I am in agreement with proceeding with the debate, but I should like to avoid arguments."
"Let us therefore go on with the debate"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged."
"The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative."
"The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures."
"Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders."
"In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built."
"The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry."
"In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations."
"on behalf on the EFD Group. - (LT) Madam President, today, if we were to balance the benefits of the nuclear industry and the dangers it poses on a pair of scales, it is difficult to say which one would outweigh the other."
"Experience has shown that nuclear power plants are rather vulnerable - both Chernobyl 25 years ago and Fukushima a few months ago."
"Very close to Lithuania, on the European Union's external border, there are plans to build disproportionately powerful nuclear power plants, actually they are already being built, the safety and environmental impact of which is causing much controversy."
"An accident in these power plants would pose huge dangers to both Lithuania and the entire European Union."
"We must ensure that the highest safety standards are applied not just in Europe, but beyond its borders as well."
"We must make every effort to ensure the introduction of a requirement for compulsory nuclear power plant safety checks worldwide."
"In the area of nuclear safety, there is a particular focus on the European Commission."
"It must monitor and check whether this approach is mirrored in neighbouring countries, particularly those intending to build nuclear power plants next to the EU's external borders, and whether the provisions of international conventions are properly implemented or are little more than a piece of paper."
"We must ensure that not just European Union Member States, but neighbouring countries, in particular, Russia and Belarus, comply with the most stringent safety and environmental standards."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in Austria, where you like to spend your holidays, we are doing very well when it comes to nuclear power plants."
"The radioactive intensity of today's debate does, of course, have one benefit."
"It reminds you, Mr Oettinger, that you can undergo a road-to-Damascus conversion and switch from being a friend of EnBW, the German power company, to being the person responsible for monitoring nuclear power stations."
"If you do really well, you may even be drawing up the exit strategy."
"However, you must be aware that this will involve a struggle over responsibilities."
"The 'more' that you promised us is not enough and, of course, it is very important for you to put pressure on a joint neighbouring country of ours, the Czech Republic, which, as far as I understand it, would prefer to not take part in any kind of more critical test, in particular, with regard to crimes."
"You should also be exerting pressure on the blatant nuclear lobbyists from the United Kingdom, which brings us to the main topic."
"Do not allow yourself to be influenced by the lobbyists in the Commission."
"Take a look at who really holds the power in important organisations such as the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA)."
"Keep an eye on Dominique Ristori, a Commission official who is invisibly but inextricably linked with the nuclear lobby, and on other Commission officials."
"It will be worth the effort if it enables you to achieve the objective that you say you want to achieve."
"Most importantly, you can no longer be seen to be on the side of German industry and all the power companies whose names begin with E - EDF, E.ON and EnBW - in this discussion."
"You need to keep a critical distance from them."
"Austria, the country that is also your holiday destination, will give you the help you need."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop."
"When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members' wishes."
"The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity."
"The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor."
"There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning."
"Is a joint review of stress tests now required?"
"I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament's joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House."
"On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy."
"Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there."
"This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time."
"He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in."
"Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, the stress tests are necessary and also long overdue."
"It is surprising that they have not been carried out before."
"You should take the credit for the fact that all the nuclear power stations in the EU are finally going to be inspected."
"However, we must admit that we are skating on very thin ice with these stress tests."
"You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure."
"Of course, there is the risk that the inspection will differ from country to country."
"Some will not want to include aircraft crashes and others will only open up a part of their plants for stress tests."
"You need to make sure that the tests are genuinely comprehensive."
"It is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation."
"The area of human failure is incomplete."
"The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside."
"That is precisely what is not being tested."
"I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom."
"We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them."
"I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism."
"This really must be included in the stress test."
"Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points?"
"There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing."
"Will some of the power plants really be shut down or modernised?"
"It is high time that the Euratom Treaty was revised."
"This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue."
"Madam President, certain Member States have jumped the gun on stress tests."
"As we have heard, the UK nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, published his interim report even before the stress tests had been agreed."
"Will the Commission insist that all Member States conduct the stress tests properly, and do not do their own lightweight version?"
"I am particularly concerned that the UK Government might go ahead with approving a whole new generation of nuclear power stations before the stress test procedure is concluded in June next year."
"Commissioner, do you agree that this would be unwise in terms of European nuclear safety?"
"Will you make sure that information which cannot be disclosed publicly due to security concerns is at least shared in a secure forum, such as between national security services?"
"(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, the departure from nuclear energy that we have witnessed, for example, in Germany, is a politically flawed decision likely to have disastrous economic consequences, not only for Germany itself, but also for Central Europe, to say the very least."
"I am in no way criticising the German decision, as each Member State of the European Union has the right to set its own energy agenda with all the related economic, social and political consequences."
"By the same token, I insist that my country, the Czech Republic, also has the right to determine for itself how it will produce electricity."
"One third of the Czech energy mix comprises power obtained from reliable nuclear plants."
"I believe that we will continue to strengthen our nuclear resources and that we will develop further nuclear power units in compliance with all of the critical safety and control parameters and requirements."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I have a question for Mr Strejček."
"What do you say to the fact that as far as we know, the Czech Republic would prefer not to take part in serious stress tests and that it does not want to be involved in the question of criminal attacks?"
"What is your own approach to the nuclear industry and what are your personal relationships with these lobby groups?"
"(CS) Madam President, at this point, I would first like to emphasise to my fellow Member that I have no contacts with this lobby group."
"Secondly, I am not aware of any statement by the Czech Government to the effect that Czech nuclear power plants are out of control, as reported by Commissioner Oettinger."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, you are not being attacked personally in this matter, Commissioner, but you must understand that we are extremely disappointed that the Commission has given in so easily to pressure from some Member States, and France in particular."
"So we do indeed want to phase out nuclear power because we believe that this is the only way to eliminate the nuclear risk."
"In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years."
"We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward."
"The tests do not predict airplane crashes, either over fuel ponds or over reactors."
"Neither do they predict terrorist attacks."
"We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors (PWRs)."
"That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Jadot, can you confirm that the joint resolution which we have drawn up on the subject of stress tests was initially signed by the chairs of your group, Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit, who then opposed it in plenary, despite the fact that no major changes had been made?"
"Do you also believe that this was not very helpful to Mr Oettinger who is committed to introducing more stringent stress tests?"
"(FR) Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy."
"That is not true."
"All the surveys show that 77% of French people want to move away from nuclear energy, but in France we cannot have that debate."
"(CS) Madam President, just three brief comments on the Commissioner's statement."
"First, I am in favour of the stress test methodology put forward by the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association."
"These tests assume a probabilistic approach, which the Commissioner has abandoned in favour of a more absolutist approach."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that stress tests should be established in all areas where energy is produced, if this whole approach to public safety is to be credible."
"In energy production, the highest numbers of casualties have been reported in locations where dams have burst."
"In 1976, for example, 26 000 people died when a dam broke in China."
"Thirdly, I would like to say that the Commissioner seems to have embarked on a green pilgrimage, but the Polish satirist, Jerzy Lec, notes that even if you do go on a pilgrimage, you will still be smelly and you will still have sweaty feet."
"Madam President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I trust in his sincere efforts to fight nuclear disasters and I trust his sensitivity and objectivity in providing Europe with a safety net against nuclear disasters."
"I consider that stress tests should be undertaken not only within the European Union and neighbouring countries, but at a global level."
"This is a global issue."
"Hence, I welcome the comments made by the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, who stated that he will convene a high-level meeting in Vienna on 24 June."
"I hope that the Commissioner will be there."
"The UN Secretary-General has set out five points on nuclear safety and, from what I have seen, they tally with the rules the Commissioner brought to us and on which he briefed us as to how we should proceed."
"In Vienna, we have an international meeting, under the umbrella of the United Nations."
"Then, on 22 September, we will have a very high-level meeting on nuclear safety at the United Nations in New York."
"In my opinion, that is how we can cope with this issue."
"Europe is not the only place or continent facing nuclear disasters, so let us face the issue with a global approach."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in the bank stress tests, as we know, the leeway given was so generous that almost all the institutions investigated were able to come out of the tests relatively well."
"Whenever a risk was suspected, a less thorough investigation was carried out, just to be on the safe side."
"We have to presume that things may not be very different in the case of the nuclear power stations."
"The nuclear stress tests have so far proved simply to be a placebo for the worried citizens of Europe."
"Apart from the fact that the tests, which have no consequences at the lowest level, are pure nonsense, it is doubtful whether even stringent test criteria would achieve the desired objective."
"The question always concerns the standards on which the tests will be based, as allegedly none of the 17 German reactors would be approved today, simply because the standards which applied when they were built do not meet current requirements."
"Critics are doubtful about whether even the brand new nuclear power stations like the European pressurised water reactors being constructed in France and Finland would meet the latest safety requirements."
"When you find out that some nuclear power plants cannot even withstand storms, all you can do is to call on everyone to work towards getting out of nuclear energy as soon as possible."
"(LT) Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today, particularly as regards the European Union's neighbourhood."
"Radioactive contamination is transboundary in nature."
"This was sorely felt after Chernobyl and Fukushima."
"The highest nuclear safety standards should therefore be legally binding and global, facilities everywhere should be equally safe, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be strengthened."
"Standards applied in the European Union are among the highest in the world."
"To achieve even greater security, we will carry out stress tests in nuclear power plants that are functioning, those that are planned and those that have been closed."
"However, if we want to be safe, identical criteria should be applied to facilities already existing or planned in the EU's neighbourhood (Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Armenia, Switzerland and Ukraine)."
"As we consistently strive for this, we must speak with one voice."
"At the moment, less than 100 km from the European Union's external border, near St Petersburg, a nuclear power plant with a Chernobyl-type reactor is still in operation."
"Russia is planning to build two new nuclear power plants even closer to the European Union's borders in Belarus and Kaliningrad."
"From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament."
"Both projects have similar problems."
"Work has begun even before the environmental impact assessment is completed and, as yet, there has been no explanation of the criteria for choosing the construction site of either nuclear power plant, possible alternative sites have not been analysed and general evacuation plans have not been drawn up."
"There are plans for both nuclear power plants to have experimental reactors, the safety of which is impossible to evaluate, as they have not yet been in operation anywhere."
"Generally speaking, Belarus is not ready to develop nuclear energy, and the Russian Government is not only failing to answer the questions put by neighbouring countries, but is ignoring its population's requests for consultations."
"For a second time, through the use of red tape, it is refusing to allow the registration of an initiative regarding a public referendum on the issue of nuclear power plant construction."
"One of the steps that might encourage the European Union's neighbours to comply with the highest safety standards would be for the whole of the Union to refuse to buy electricity produced while failing to respect these standards."
"We must not use EU citizens' money to support unsafe nuclear energy."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate."
"We need comprehensive stress tests."
"Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable."
"The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement."
"We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions."
"We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement."
"Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours."
"Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies?"
"Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level."
"(FR) Madam President, we actually have two questions facing us."
"The first is about the nuclear share in Europe."
"On this issue, I believe that in the coming year, we must have a transparent public debate within the Union and within the Member States concerned."
"The second question is about the tests that have brought us all here this morning."
"I would like to mention to you, Commissioner, the four principles that I think we should keep for a genuine control mechanism."
"The first principle is that a control mechanism must be obligatory."
"The second principle is that this control mechanism should be entrusted to an independent and impartial authority."
"I do not have much faith in self-regulation."
"The third principle is that this mechanism should be binding."
"If the tests should ever give negative results for particular installations, then these tests should have a binding effect on Member States, which would then have no choice but to close those non-functioning installations."
"The fourth point is that this mechanism must be transparent: the results must be put before public opinion."
"In this way, we will perhaps be able to bring about what Mrs Ek has called a European safety culture."
"(PL) Madam President, nuclear safety issues - both in the Member States and in neighbouring countries - should be the object of the European Union's particular attention."
"Following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan, the Commission announced stress tests for similar facilities in the European Union."
"This was very good news and a very good decision."
"We are waiting for it to be implemented."
"In view of the safety needs of all the people of Europe, particular attention should be given to making the appropriate use of all available means in order to raise safety standards and eliminate potential threats from nuclear energy."
"It is not only power stations lying within the Member States which are a potential danger, but also those located in countries which are neighbours of the Union."
"It is also necessary to provide suitable motivation and support for the Member States to conduct thorough stress tests of the Union's power stations."
"I would also like to underscore the profound need for additional investment, both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticipating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, using the example of the Cattenom nuclear power station which threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Luxembourg and also in the German regions of the Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, I would like to explain why these watered-down stress tests will not do the job."
"Cattenom is on the approach path to Luxembourg airport and it is precisely the consequences of a plane crashing on Cattenom which are not being investigated."
"After the first document was submitted by the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), you yourself tabled an amendment to have aircraft crashes included in the initiating events on page 4 of the document."
"This amendment, which was a good one, was blocked by France and the United Kingdom."
"It disturbs us that you have fought for this and lost and that you have still not been able to admit that you have lost."
"That is dishonest and this is why we are critical of you."
"We must make it clearer that France and the United Kingdom are currently not cooperating over the things that we and you both want."
"We need to take an honest look at this issue."
"Mr Liese, the German Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union did not support us on the famous resolution about the exit from nuclear power."
"Chancellor Merkel is rather braver than you are, at least on this occasion."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I am directly addressing the proposal you have brought before Parliament today and I will tell you totally frankly that I think some of us are entitled to be disappointed with this proposal, because the proposal being tabled is not just weak but also has huge gaps."
"I think this is a European issue, not a question of which Member States have nuclear industries and which do not: it is an issue for the whole of Europe, and Europe desperately needs good news."
"I must tell you, sincerely, that one of those items of good news is guaranteeing the public that we are taking care of their safety."
"If these tests are carried out under the terms that you are presenting, Commissioner, whereby the first stage is undertaken by the stakeholders themselves, the second stage is carried out by the governments defending those stakeholders and the third stage is undertaken by partners, who are really stakeholders, I ask myself if the result will not be to say, in the end, that all nuclear plants are in good health and are to be recommended."
"We know that it is not the case, and for this reason I very much hope there will be serious consequences and that we will be able to tell the public that we are taking care of their safety and not just pretending that we are."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Oettinger."
"He has struggled and he has achieved a great deal."
"The results are not perfect, but the accusations being made against Mr Oettinger today apply above all to us."
"We must be self-critical and admit that we did not manage to adopt the resolution."
"Parts of my group were also not in a position to vote in favour, which is regrettable."
"However, the accusations also apply to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who first of all signed the resolution and then ultimately failed to support it in plenary."
"This made Mr Oettinger's life difficult in his struggle with the Member States to introduce more stringent stress tests."
"This is the first step, but we must go further."
"We need to amend the directive."
"Mr Oettinger, we will support you in ensuring that in future, it is made legally binding."
"We need to extend it to cover our neighbouring countries."
"I fully support what Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienhas said."
"Germany has been mentioned several times and, of course, we will have to live with the criticism."
"However, I would like to point out that 13 EU Member States are already functioning without nuclear energy, including countries with successful economies such as Austria and Denmark, so we must be able to accept this possibility in Germany."
"I would also like to say that Chancellor Merkel gave a government policy statement today in the German parliament and highlighted once again that we must at least make joint progress in the areas we agree on in Europe."
"For example, she specifically mentioned energy efficiency."
"I would like to give Mr Oettinger my support and encourage him to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy efficiency in two weeks."
"I am very happy with the parts that we already know about, which are a mix of incentives and obligations for those affected."
"I do not like the fact that the Member States are supposed to set their own goals."
"We need the Commission to come up with a target, either mandatory or in the form of a guideline."
"Please introduce a target and then we will have a very good proposal."
"(NL) Madam President, whether you are in favour of nuclear power or, like me, are an ardent supporter of a nuclear-free Europe, all of us should nonetheless be in favour of safety."
"In this respect, my fellow Members from the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who are preaching modesty are missing the point just a bit."
"If Fukushima has taught us anything, then it is, more than anything else, that we are unprepared for disasters, that we are unprepared for all sorts of things which could happen tomorrow and which, if they did, would have the gravest possible consequences."
"For this reason, Commissioner, I am not interested in how many compliments or objections you are going to receive here, at this time."
"What I am interested in are results."
"We are worried, extremely worried, because the worst thing that could happen is that we carry out stress tests in the near future and get the kinds of results which will provide the perfect excuse for many of the operators of very old power plants, including those in the area where I live, to keep them in operation even longer, instead of closing them."
"I have two questions."
"How are you going to ensure that the independence of these stress tests really is guaranteed?"
"Secondly, how will you ensure that the results actually will lead to the closure of the oldest nuclear power plants?"
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, we can only thank and congratulate you for having taken this initiative."
"Unfortunately, I share the view of those who are particularly disappointed with the result, which represents a victory for the operators of nuclear facilities, for the safety authorities who have covered up what has been done for thirty years, and for the Member States who do not want to reconsider the choices that they have made, not just to keep nuclear power, but also the choices in relation to risk evaluation."
"Commissioner, we must deal with the underlying problem and look again at Euratom, as you have said."
"That is, we must review the question of how free the Member States are to block everything, as France has clearly done."
"We must look again at the unacceptable issues in relation to responsibility - because, if the rules of ordinary law concerning responsibility were applied, we would not have these problems."
"We must also look again at the application of rules of ordinary law concerning the right of European citizens to information, which, under present conditions, the system that has been introduced clearly does not safeguard."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many fellow Members have already mentioned the drawbacks with stress tests: the fact that too much relies on their voluntary nature and, not least, how reactors would stand up to terrorist attacks."
"My fellow Member, Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, mentioned one reason why the weaknesses of stress tests are very regrettable."
"Close to St Petersburg, and 200 kilometres from Helsinki and Tallinn, are four Chernobyl-type reactors which threaten the safety of hundreds and thousands of EU citizens."
"Commissioner Oettinger, you are discussing something else."
"Commissioner Oettinger, would you please listen."
"Herr Kommissar Oettinger, ich bitte Ihnen ..."
"Commissioner Oettinger, please answer this: if Russia agrees to carry out stress tests on their nuclear plants with reference to the criteria that I am now pushing for, do you believe that it will actually improve our safety, given that there are several Chernobyl-type reactors close to the EU's borders?"
"(SL) Madam President, may I say, Commissioner, you have achieved a great deal."
"In a very short time, you have managed to draw up a very detailed specification of the stress tests and brokered an agreement between the European Commission and the 27 regulatory bodies of the Member States."
"Safety limits, which, on this occasion, exceed the limits of any hypothetical accident, will be reassessed by the Member States."
"That is an important piece of added value and an additional requirement."
"Some members have been critical about the human factor not having been assessed or properly taken into account."
"I have to say that I have personally read closely the specification of these stress tests and am pleased that the tests cover, not just technology, but the human factor and organisational aspects as well."
"With this, we have taken a great step forward towards making the safety standards of the European Union uniform and I think that we should look for other ways to go even further; where and how can we take another major step in order to enhance EU powers in this area?"
"In that respect, I expect the European Commission to come up with a proposal."
"In the interests of greater confidence, international inspections of the tests carried out will be undertaken and that is where I have a question."
"I wonder whether the group of seven people will be so made up as to consist of representatives of the European Commission and of the regulatory bodies, or will it also include independent experts?"
"If so, I would be interested to know on what basis they will be selected."
"I have two more questions."
"Firstly, will these tests have to be carried out by German nuclear plants which have been shut down?"
"Secondly, what will be the consequences of the closure of German nuclear power plants for the internal European energy market?"
"As regards the Nuclear Waste Directive, I would say that we will have more opportunities than you have mentioned in your speech to discuss it next time, and I hope that the European Commission will take into account the proposals of the European Parliament because, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we have voted for several stronger proposals than were originally proposed by the European Commission?."
"Madam President, threats to EU nuclear power plants, if they are real, are a question of life and death for thousands of people."
"Even small nations must be prepared for the most severe circumstances, including terrorist attacks and airplane crashes."
"How would the citizens of major EU countries feel if a non-democratic country built an insufficiently tested nuclear power plant close to Brussels, Berlin, Paris or London, without consulting its public or sharing reliable information with its neighbouring countries?"
"Lithuania is currently facing such a situation."
"In close proximity to Vilnius, Belarus - with a total absence of transparency - is beginning to construct a nuclear plant."
"It is vitally important that the EU, with the support of international organisations, extends the practice of nuclear plant stress testing around the world, and especially to its external borders."
"(FR) Madam President, for my part, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for his determination - which has been unfaltering from the start - on the difficult subject of nuclear safety, given that competences on this matter largely belong to the Member States."
"As has already been said, our first demand is obviously the revision of this Euratom Treaty, which has remained virtually unchanged since it was first drawn up."
"Admittedly, the audit of the 143 nuclear reactors in Europe will, in the end, only relate to the 'Fukushima' scenario, and you have clearly set the limits for this, Commissioner."
"That is already a first victory; in any event, it represents a real break from the culture of secrecy that has characterised this sector for more than forty years now."
"The nuclear industry, more than others, must understand that transparency is crucial for all these issues concerning safety - you definitely repeated the word more than ten times, Commissioner - as is the independence of both the operators and the state supervisory authorities, with the appointment of independent experts, and we are still not satisfied on this matter."
"(DE) Madam President, the Austrian people voted with a clear majority against nuclear power and this sends a clear message to our politicians."
"I would like to mention that Mr Palacio has already made a great effort to give Europe more room for manoeuvre in this area."
"Mr Piebalgs' nuclear safety directive was also successful."
"I hope that we will soon have a new nuclear safety directive which is binding and which lays down the inspection procedures and the standards."
"We should be evaluating which of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards are available to us and which can be incorporated into EU law in a legally binding way."
"Of course, one-off stress tests are not enough."
"In future, there must be a series of stress tests so that dangerous nuclear power plants can be shut down immediately."
"In order to achieve this, we need an EU regulator who has joint powers with the national regulators and who is entitled to disconnect from the grid any power stations which fail to meet these standards."
"I can only endorse what has already been said today."
"The Euratom Treaty must be revised."
"We must call on the Heads of State or Government to ensure that this becomes a joint European issue in the Council."
"It must not be the case as it has generally been in the past in the Council that the nuclear working group opposes anything which comes out of Europe."
"Most importantly, we need research within the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) into the decommissioning of nuclear power plants."
"We also need research into final storage and we should be focusing on protection, safety, training and inspections."
"We must introduce the clearing house model that is currently in front of us into European legislation."
"Mr Oettinger, you can rely on the support of this House in this respect."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, governments cannot deal with a more important task today than elaborating methods to deal with events occurring with low probability, for instance, the breakdown of cooling water or electric supply, and I agree with Mr Rübig in that this should not be a single event, but should be executed over a longer period of time and on a regular basis."
"I also agree that we should extend this stress test in neighbouring countries, the countries east of our borders."
"This is why I ask the Commission to consider the possibility of how to execute a stress test in the context of the Eastern partnership."
"And finally, Commissioner, protection against cyber attacks and terrorist attacks has to be established in all sectoral policies of the European Union where cross-border emission of hazardous materials may occur."
"The incumbent Hungarian Government failed the stress test you envision, Commissioner, because it has repeatedly impeded the construction of the NATO radar facility, which would have provided greater protection for the Paks nuclear power plant against aircraft attacks than the protection we have today, for the past seven years."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, it is vital that we set the bar high with these stress tests and that the tests are actually conducted according to the same criteria across the whole of Europe."
"After all, many nuclear power plants are situated close to national borders, as we know, and also in very densely populated areas."
"The fact that we are going to have an independent and objective European inspection of every nuclear plant is a very positive thing because this will strengthen the European energy policy."
"Therefore, full marks to you, Commissioner."
"All European citizens have the right to know whether or not those nuclear power plants are actually safe."
"If acts of terrorism and cyber attacks are not going to be covered by the stress tests, then so be it."
"You have explained why that is the case and we can understand that."
"However, that obviously should not exempt the European Commission from its duty to continue badgering Member States about this and to maintain pressure on the national security services so that these services actually investigate whether the plants are going to be prepared for those risks, too."
"Of course, the credibility of these tests will stand or fall on the implementation of the results."
"We will have to take into account the probability that some of the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe will not pass these tests, that the weakest will go to the wall and that several plants will perhaps have to close."
"Then, naturally, a unique moment of opportunity for us to switch to renewable sources of energy will present itself."
"It is clear, as Mr Leinen said a little while ago, that at that moment, a solution will primarily present itself at a European level."
"It is also clear that we should opt for joint European investments, coordinated investments, and for joint European financing through project bonds."
"We are counting on you to take the lead at that moment, in this new step towards the development of that European energy policy."
"Thank you and good luck."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, you have received both compliments and criticism today."
"I am going to give you a pat on the back, too, but I am also going to give you a slap on the wrists."
"I am happy with the European stress tests, which will be applied in exactly the same way throughout the EU."
"They were badly needed."
"The only thing that worries me is this false sense of security."
"We should not be attesting to the safety of nuclear power plants: we have to investigate what exactly the risks are and not give people a false sense of security."
"We need independent supervision across the EU and we have to have an independent regulator."
"At present, we have no such regulator."
"We have now created an additional layer, but can you tell us whether we are eventually going to get an additional independent regulator, whose assessment will be supplemented by a second scientific opinion?"
"I agree with my fellow Members, Belet and Leinen, that this matter should no longer fall under the Euratom Treaty."
"Our citizens are entitled to maximum security and it is time we removed this aspect from the Euratom Treaty."
"Are you going to start that debate?"
"There is, then, one matter which has not received enough attention: what are you going to do about the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency in response to the Fukushima disaster?"
"Are you possibly going to adjust the stress test?"
"Can you say what will happen in the event of the stress test potentially having a negative outcome?"
"I am really very disappointed about what has happened to our resolution and I very much regret that we have allowed ourselves to be carried away by our emotions."
"Safety should always come first, surely?"
"(FR) Madam President, this debate got off to a bad start, with the good guys, the anti-nuclear people, on one side, and the bad guys, those who still support nuclear power, on the other."
"I would nevertheless point out again that nuclear power is part of the energy mix that we here in this Parliament wanted and hoped for."
"Next, I would like to complain a bit about this debate, with its appeals to collective fear."
"This is regrettable when we are dealing with a subject as important as this one."
"It is true that nuclear power stations can, in certain cases, pose risks, but I am quite shocked because there is a certain mistrust here in this Parliament of staff who work in nuclear power stations on a daily basis and who ensure the safety of our nuclear power from day to day."
"I would ask you to be responsible, therefore."
"We know that there is a desire in the European Union to ensure the security of our power stations from day to day."
"I would also like to add that we know perfectly well that flying over nuclear power stations is prohibited - at least, in France - and that there is no nuclear power station in France which is further than 25 km from an air base, with the air bases being responsible for monitoring the air space above nuclear power stations."
"So yes, Commissioner, we agree with you."
"We are in agreement on these tests."
"Congratulations, you have got them."
"These tests are essential, because we have to make sure that our populations regain confidence in our nuclear power stations."
"These tests are essential; they must take place in a spirit of complete independence so that this confidence can be regained."
"We can also see, however, that confidentiality is necessary in certain cases."
"When it comes to combating terrorism, we cannot conceive of a Member State revealing strategic plans for combating terrorism in advance."
"So, let us take some responsibility."
"Let us have confidence in our Commissioner, and I am convinced that we will have tests which are rigorous and which are capable of reassuring us."
"Madam President, like other colleagues, I believe that safety must come first."
"However, I also believe that nuclear power should be part of our future energy mix."
"It is low carbon and it can provide a secure supply."
"For example, it will mean that prosperous European countries will not have to import energy from less prosperous countries, with all the problems that that can bring."
"It is also supported by communities like Anglesey in North Wales, who already have a nuclear power station."
"However, like all other colleagues, I also support stress tests - as does the UK - and I think all Member States should give their commitment to those stress tests."
"They should also be done quickly, they should cover all eventualities and they should cover both nuclear plants and other facilities within the fuel cycle."
"This is such an important issue for us all."
"I believe Europe needs nuclear power, but it needs safe nuclear power."
"(PL) Madam President, following the Fukushima disaster, society has become increasingly worried about the safety of nuclear power plants in Europe."
"This is understandable."
"The information reaching us from Japan is, at times, horrific and terrifying, and shows that serious contamination of the country has occurred."
"None of us would like this to be repeated in Europe, just as no one would like a repeat of Chernobyl."
"On the contrary, to put society's fears at ease, it is all the more necessary to do everything to guarantee the safety of nuclear energy in Europe."
"This is why the stress tests are so important."
"However, it is also important that they be carried out very thoroughly, to guarantee objectivity and to provide credibility and the certainty that their conduct will allow the anticipation of emergency situations and crises, which can happen just the same in Europe as they have done in Japan."
"We must do everything to make Europe safe and restore confidence in this source of energy."
"However, we should also remember other energy sources, such as the unconventional shale gas, for example."
"(PL) Madam President, for many years, nuclear power was considered to be the energy of the future - green, efficient, non-polluting."
"The tragedies in Chernobyl and, recently, in Fukushima, have shown the other side of the coin."
"However, our objective today cannot be - as the Left would like - to conduct stress tests only so that with a biased interpretation of their results, there will be a pretext for giving up nuclear energy in Europe."
"Today, our objective must be to improve the safety of nuclear power plants, calm public opinion and change the negative image of nuclear power in Europe."
"This should be our priority today."
"Therefore, I do not understand the voices of the Left which are talking about another tax on nuclear energy and the ultimate abandonment of this type of energy source."
"That route, at a time when there is a lack of alternative sources, will lead to jumps in electricity prices."
"Today, Europe needs revision of the law on nuclear energy in the areas of the responsibilities of Member States, establishment of common rules and optimisation of safety standards in the Union."
"The stress tests must answer our questions about safety and take account of all possible forms of danger, from terrorist attacks to power cuts."
"Madam President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that today, the European Union is changing its internal policy regarding nuclear safety but, at the same time, we are beginning work on external energy policy."
"At one point in the future, these policies should be merged."
"The nuclear stress tests should not only help the Commission revise the safety directive, but should also be included in the Commission report on the external dimension of energy policy which will soon be published."
"Stress tests and energy safety should form a crucial part of our energy dialogue with third countries."
"We need to ensure that new plants in Kaliningrad and Belarus are subject to the same standards and tests as such facilities in the European Union, especially now that Russia wants to invest in nuclear power plants."
"(LT) Madam President, safeguarding nuclear safety is an issue relevant for all countries, whether they have nuclear power plants or not."
"Of course, we can express indignation over what has happened in the past, but today, it is clear that we must move forward."
"Commissioner, it is really commendable that, following the Fukushima accident, you responded promptly and initiated the idea of testing nuclear power plants and it is also good that the Member States have agreed to carry out these tests."
"However, there is no system at all concerning the construction of new nuclear power plants close to the European Union's borders, as has already been mentioned several times when discussing the construction of the Kaliningrad and Belarusian nuclear power plants."
"I therefore believe that we must initiate and adopt appropriate legislation, as a matter of urgency, which would ensure systematic, binding procedures, based on clear principles, for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants."
"We would then have objective information about the possible threat and might hope to avoid it."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors."
"We are faced, however, with ageing power plants and the practice of subcontracting."
"80% of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractors."
"Furthermore, we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risks."
"When we look at these stress tests as they relate to France, they become 'relaxation tests'."
"Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France."
"This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue, but must be a European issue, the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation for the way that the European Commission, in launching a transparent review of all 143 nuclear power plants in the European Union, has acted swiftly to assuage Europeans' concerns that the large number of nuclear power plants throughout Europe could be a risk to them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that these stress tests are just the beginning of an extensive dialogue on this issue, because only after evaluating the tests will we be able to see the true state of the nuclear power sector in Europe."
"I am confident that the data from the stress tests will prepare us for a new round of talks on this issue, where we will discuss a new safety policy for the European Union in this field."
"Today, then, rather than cast doubt on the Commission's efforts to review the security risks of our nuclear power plants, let us try to gather as much objective information about their actual condition as we can."
"This will help us in our future decision making on nuclear safety in Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, I will be happy to discuss your main comments and proposals relating to the stress tests that will be carried out over the next few months."
"First of all, however, if you are concerned that a watered-down stress test will turn into a seal of approval without the necessary objectivity, I can assure you that I will do everything possible during the months to come, together with my offices, to ensure that this assumption is unfounded."
"(Applause)"
"This is currently a concern which I completely understand, but some Members also have prejudices."
"I would like to ask you not to judge any of the nuclear power stations and also not to judge me and my work until after the stress tests have been completed."
"That is my offer to everyone, including Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, and I am prepared to take a critical and transparent approach to the next steps in the process."
"Secondly, if we assume that the outcome of the stress tests will not be a placebo and that the seal of approval will not be handed out randomly, but instead that the tests will be constructive, critical and objective, then I believe that these stress tests will bring many benefits and that the alternative, not carrying out any stress tests, would be a worse solution."
"(Applause)"
"We have had some tough negotiations."
"The first draft did not fulfil my requirements."
"However, the version that was signed largely meets the expectations of the citizens, who are legitimately concerned about high levels of safety in Europe."
"I would like to explain once again, Mr Turmes, that if I had not signed the revised and, in my opinion, positive version of the test criteria, we would now have nothing."
"As the saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
"My second point is that you can expect me to be thorough and objective, but I have noticed a few things."
"One was the speech by a Member from the United Kingdom of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe whose party is part of the coalition government in the UK."
"This party was opposed to nuclear power before the elections and supported it afterwards and this is the person who is criticising my thoroughness when it comes to the stress tests."
"I can only say that this speech would have been more appropriate at the party conference in London than it was here in Strasbourg."
"Another speech comes to mind."
"The Spanish Government did not give me any visible support on the subject of the thorough stress tests."
"For this reason, a speech by a Member who belongs to the party which is in government in Spain is also not very helpful."
"That also applies to the group to which I belong, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Some of the speeches made on behalf of the groups unfortunately demonstrate how unsuccessful the representatives of the groups have so far been within their own parties in their own home countries in achieving their objectives."
"In sporting terms, I am interested in what will appear on this subject in the election manifesto of the French socialist party."
"I am very interested in who the candidate will be and what the manifesto will look like."
"However, the Parliament here in Strasbourg cannot control matters which fall within the remit of the nation states."
"To get to the heart of the matter, the energy mix remains a matter for the national governments and parliaments."
"We may welcome this or we may regret it."
"As a democrat, I have to accept it."
"The fact that independent teams are now, for the first time, monitoring the national nuclear regulators and that the monitors are being monitored is, in my opinion, an historic step forwards in the interest of the common safety of the citizens of Europe."
"Mr Turmes, aircraft crashes are covered by the stress tests."
"The consequences of an aircraft crashing onto a nuclear power station are specifically included in the test criteria and, therefore, form part of the investigation in the third stage."
"I will be happy to show you."
"Mr Turmes, if every Member of this House were as noisy as you are, there would be chaos in the Chamber."
"Only one person can get away with this."
"I will be happy to talk about this afterwards."
"Aircraft crashes do form part of the investigation because the impact of a crash on the safety of nuclear power plants is specifically covered in the criteria."
"My next point is that I have been accused of concealing the voluntary nature of the tests."
"Exactly the opposite is true."
"From the first meeting in committee onwards, I have always emphasised that the stress test is voluntary."
"However, we have persuaded every Member State to take part."
"All 14 Member States have voluntarily opted to become involved, which is a big success for the European Parliament."
"What will happen at the end?"
"I would like to make it quite clear that I am relying on the power of facts."
"If there are serious problems with a particular nuclear power station, the citizens of Europe and of the relevant Member State will call for the necessary measures to be taken."
"This is what I believe and this is why transparency, thoroughness and objectivity are so important."
"I am determined to promote this over the next few months."
"The proposal to revise the Euratom Treaty is wonderful."
"However, the Euratom Treaty is primary law and, therefore, is not the concern of the Commission but of the Member States."
"A change to the Euratom Treaty requires unanimity."
"I can only say to anyone who has good proposals to make on this subject: do you really believe, given the variety of opinions and moods and the supporters and opponents of nuclear power, that we would be likely to achieve unanimity about the continuation of the Euratom Treaty?"
"I do not believe that it is very likely."
"For this reason, I am in favour of taking a realistic approach and making the best we can out of the Treaty that we have."
"The next question concerns the independence of the test."
"The peer review during the third stage, which is the main part of the test, involves a team with seven external members."
"It has been specifically stated that the team can include experts from third countries."
"It also involves the Commission."
"You can rely on me to make sure that the Commission officials do not bring any preconceptions or prejudices with them and do their work thoroughly and objectively."
"To assume otherwise would be unfair to our officials."
"This is why I will be standing up for my officials during this process."
"Then there is the question of Belarus and Russia."
"The fact is that our authority, yours here in Parliament and ours in the Commission, is unfortunately very limited in Minsk."
"We simply have to accept that."
"Perhaps we will come up with some ideas about how we can get the government there back on track."
"However, at the moment we simply have to accept that the government in power in Minsk has no policies, no transparency, no democracy and no concept of safety."
"For this reason, we can only call on the government to change."
"We cannot do any more."
"We have a much better partnership with Russia."
"The subject of safety tests for nuclear power stations will play a central role in our discussions with our partners in Russia over the next few weeks."
"A question was asked about Kaliningrad."
"My message to the Members from the Baltic States and from Poland is as follows: we can only apply our strictest technical specifications to the nuclear power station which is being planned and which will be built in Kaliningrad if we allow the electricity from this power station to be sold on the European market."
"However, if we do not accept the electricity and an electricity exchange is not possible, because we are planning our own nuclear power stations in the Baltic States, we will have less control over the technology used in Kaliningrad than if we had an open electricity market."
"I will be happy to have more in-depth discussions on this subject."
"Finally, please believe me when I say that I will not allow a watered-down stress test to take place."
"However, please accept, on the other hand, the fact that the stress test does not include an automatic mechanism for shutting down a power station simply because you have not been successful with your programmes in your Member States."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"After what happened in Japan recently, it is crucial that stress tests be carried out on European nuclear plants to assess health standards and risks, avoid potential disasters and alleviate public concern."
"It is a major concern for the people of Ireland that no stress test will be done in Sellafield, which is located just a few hundred kilometres from the coast of Ireland."
"There is a significant risk to Ireland from those nuclear plants on the British coast."
"Sellafield is the best-known station and that is where there was a significant leakage a little while ago, in 2005."
"The response of the British authorities was that an exemption applies in the case of Sellafield because power is no longer being generated there."
"That is of little comfort to those in Ireland who will suffer greatly in the event of an accident."
"The Sellafield station is very close to Ireland and there have been many accidents there to date, and therefore I am asking the Commission to put pressure on the British authorities to stress-test the station because it continues to be a risk to the people of Ireland."
"in writing. - (LV) After the nuclear accident at Fukushima, EU Member States collectively agreed that the European Union must conduct stress tests on nuclear plants, and asked the entire world to do so as well."
"We still do not have any news regarding whether such tests will be conducted on those reactors operating in other European nations that are not EU Member States."
"The safety of reactors located in these states directly affects the safety of European citizens."
"Our citizens are justifiably concerned whether the Union will be able to ensure the safety of new nuclear power plants that are being built, or are scheduled to be built, in the direct vicinity of EU Member States, such as those in Grodno (Belarus), and in the Russian Kaliningrad region."
"Neither Russia nor Belarus have conducted environmental impact assessments on these power plants in accordance with generally accepted international standards, as called for in the Espoo convention, to which all EU Member States are signatories."
"I believe that the construction of these nuclear power plants next to the borders of the EU can pose a threat not only to EU Member States, but also to the entire continent of Europe."
"This should be a matter of concern for the entire EU."
"The European Commission must pay due attention to this issue and must actively work to ensure safety."
"We must ensure that Russia and Belarus adhere to international standards and cooperate with international experts in all the phases of nuclear power plant planning, construction and operation."
"in writing. - (FI) Here, we are discussing stress tests for nuclear power plants because of Fukushima."
"I recall the part-session in April, at which some Members seemed to lose all sense of proportion right after the accident."
"Some associated the thousands of victims of the tsunami with the damage to the nuclear power plant."
"People in the House wondered if the thousands of victims were not enough."
"They asked how many nuclear accidents would it actually take before there was sufficient evidence."
"I could not believe my ears."
"Even now, there are no actual victims who have died from radiation at Fukushima."
"Despite the fact that Japan suffered one of the biggest ever earthquakes recorded, followed by one of the biggest tsunamis that has ever occurred, even though they were not prepared for them, even though they had not even carried out the improvements suggested, even though nothing had been done to ensure that there would be a supply of power in the event of emergencies, and even though the Japanese made other mistakes right at the start, there were few personal injuries."
"There is no doubt, of course, that the accident at Fukushima was a catastrophe."
"It should not have happened."
"There are likely to be fatalities, but they will be nothing compared to the fatalities due to coal power, for example."
"In Europe, airborne fine particles due to energy consumption now kill around 300 000 people each year."
"It is therefore paradoxical that the Fukushima accident will lead to tens of thousands of indirect victims."
"They will die prematurely because Europe will give up using nuclear power and replace it with fossil energy."
"Air quality will worsen, which will increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease and threaten the lives of asthma sufferers."
"The real killer behind the Fukushima disaster is therefore coal, to which they are now switching in Germany, for example."
"The European Commission must include neighbouring states as well when carrying out the stress tests, applying to them the same test criteria established at EU level and taking into account the cross-border nature of the possible effects of nuclear energy."
"Romania is already in the process of carrying out the stress tests."
"In assessing them, we are interested in consideration being given to the specific nature of the nuclear technology used in Romania, compared with the nuclear technologies used in the EU."
"This is why I think that the following points should be borne in mind when carrying out and assessing the stress tests:"
"the tests being applied should take into account the nuclear technology used at the power plant, which may include special characteristics that it has, without having to use test 'templates';"
"the stress tests should be evaluated on technical grounds and not on political grounds or grounds which leave room for speculation;"
"the independent peer review team should also include the national regulatory authority, along with representatives from the neighbouring countries, with a view to exchanging experience on emergency plans."
"in writing. - (LT) No one is arguing that the consequences of the disaster in the nuclear power plant will be long-lasting, both for the environment and people, and do not stop at the border."
"Three months have already passed since the disaster in Japan, and we still do not know how all of the issues will be addressed."
"The European Commission reacted to this disaster in a rapid and adequate manner, proposing stress tests for all nuclear power plants and striving for more stringent nuclear safety standards."
"Meanwhile, regular audits would strengthen nuclear safety and residents' confidence in nuclear energy."
"However, we can now see that stress tests will be difficult to implement even within the EU, although everyone understands the importance of and need for such tests."
"Furthermore, we cannot simply focus on nuclear safety in the EU."
"If the current nuclear power plant projects in Kaliningrad and Astravo on the EU border are implemented without complying with the highest international safety requirements, they will pose a threat not just to the neighbouring Baltic countries but to the whole of Europe, which is relatively near."
"The European Commission has confirmed on several occasions that some neighbouring countries - Ukraine, Russia, Sweden and Turkey - are ready to join the European stress test programme, but it is still unclear what specific action the Commission intends to take to bring about cooperation, and how the situation will pan out with regard to Belarus."
"Germany's recent decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 marks a new stage in the fundamental rethinking currently taking place in Europe concerning its energy independence and the possible alternatives to nuclear power."
"However, nuclear power remains an important component of electricity provision in many European countries."
"The security of nuclear power stations and installations must be at the heart of the Member States' concerns."
"Furthermore, nuclear safety tests must not take place exclusively in European power stations, but should also be implemented in every country that produces nuclear power."
"The effects of a nuclear disaster often cross national boundaries."
"With this in mind, I am pleased that, in Paris two days ago, there was agreement on the need for all countries using nuclear installations to implement safety audits in order to assess their capacity to withstand incidents which, up till now, have been considered 'unlikely'."
"Finally, I congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for finding a consensus on the criteria and the practical details of implementing the stress tests for nuclear installations, which will enable us to ensure the highest safety levels in the world."

"(IT) Mr President, I am speaking under Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure."
"This evening, the Supreme Court of Brazil has refused the extradition of the multiple murderer, Cesare Battisti."
"No less than two resolutions of this House have called for the contrary decision."
"I should therefore like to put on record, in addition to my own disappointment, my wish that Parliament's Bureau write to the Brazilian authorities declaring the disappointment of the entire European Parliament and, above all, expressing our solidarity and our grief to the families of the victims, who have been waiting for justice for thirty years."
"I am grateful to Mr Mauro for that apt intervention ..."
"(Mr Borghezio speaks without a microphone)."
"I believe that the whole of this House shares the disappointment and the profound bitterness at the decisions that have been taken, and therefore I can only repeat what Parliament has already made clear on this issue on at least two occasions."
"Let us convey our indignation in this spirit of disappointment and with this clarity to the Brazilian authorities."
"(IT) Mr President, I only need a few seconds to send my good wishes to Mrs Weisberger, who has recently become a mother and who is present here with her baby girl, as well as to all new mothers in this House, those who will become new mothers and those who, like me, work hard to be good mothers and good parliamentarians."
"It is lovely to see how this Chamber has been enlivened by symbols of hope, but ... (the speaker was interrupted by disturbances in the Chamber)."
"I am asking for your attention because it is important and I feel compelled to tell you what is on my mind."
"Let us see if you can manage to be more grown up, since in these last few days, I have unfortunately heard remarks such as 'Parliament is not a playground."
"This is not a playschool."
"Out with children and out with mothers'."
"Even worse, it has been said that 'the presence of children gives Members a bad image'."
"Since we very often find ourselves legislating on the work-life balance, it is truly absurd that remarks of this kind are made in this Chamber, and even more so when they are made by women."
"Combating corruption in European Sport - The work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (written declarations)"
"Mr President, over the past three months, my office has sent emails, made phone calls and drafted lists to raise awareness of this declaration on missing persons in Cyprus."
"The result has been a great success."
"Today's written declaration 10 has been passed with a strong and positive majority."
"I wish to thank the co-authors and give special thanks to Charles Tannock, who has spent every Strasbourg session rallying support with me."
"I would also like to thank the Declaration Office and my staff, whose hard work made our job that much easier."
"In the gallery today, we have a group of young people from NEPOMAK, the World Organisation for Young Overseas Cypriots in the UK, who have come to see this declaration announced."
"They are the youth of today, on whom the future depends."
"Support for this declaration signals Parliament's support for the future."
"I thank you for your support."

"Mr Bütikofer has voted on behalf of Mr Turmes."
"Please reprimand the Member for this behaviour."
"(Uproar)"
"In a previous parliamentary term, when Mr Bütikofer was not yet a Member of Parliament, a penalty was imposed on the chair of a group because he voted on behalf of his neighbour."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit may find this ridiculous and he may be able to do it within the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance but, however, the rules in Parliament are clear."

"Explanations of vote"
"(IT) Mr President, Sudan is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, the crossroads at which the Arab and African worlds meet, as well as a mosaic of a great many diverse ethnic groups."
"As provided in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, a referendum took place in January 2011 which represented the final stage of the process leading to the independence of South Sudan from North Sudan."
"South Sudan is an area with approximately 10 million inhabitants, covering almost a quarter of the land area of Sudan as currently constituted and possessing about three-quarters of its oil reserves."
"It is a state that will have to cope with huge geographical and infrastructural limitations, without an outlet to the sea and with a practically non-existent transport network connecting it to northern Sudan, where the oil treatment and transit plant is located."
"The challenges the South faces are many, beginning with laying the foundations of its own institutions and improving the socio-economic and security frameworks."
"I should note, however, that intervention in this country remains a priority for the European Union."
"Therefore, in 2010, the Council accorded Sudan a special allocation of EUR 150 million for the period 2011-2013."
"The European Union must mobilise the entire panoply of instruments at its disposal to support South Sudan in the delicate post-referendum phase."
"At the same time, we need to maintain a balanced approach in dealing with the North and the South of the country, with particular attention being paid to the needs of the South in terms of institution building and governance."
"European Union aid to South Sudan should be commensurate with what the new state can effectively absorb."
"We must avoid the situation in which future funding flows to Juba end up being improperly deployed or, even worse, feeding the existing high level of corruption."
"(SV) Mr President, Sudan is currently in a very sensitive phase ahead of independence day on 9 July this year, when Sudan will be divided into two states."
"It is extremely important for the EU to continue to provide aid and to direct this aid towards the building of the institutions that are necessary in a well-functioning independent state."
"We all know that the situation around the Horn of Africa is extremely sensitive, we know that there are problems with the democratic traditions, we know that the situation of women is incredibly difficult and we know that there are problems with pirates."
"In this context, I would also like to emphasise how important it is that people are able to exercise their human rights and are able to talk and demonstrate freely."
"This goes for the whole of the Horn of Africa and not least for the Swedish citizen, Dawit Isaak, who is imprisoned in Eritrea."
"The whole region is in need of democratic development and support from the European Union."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to say here that it is very important that the European Union ensures that it promotes peace and the independence of these two states."
"It is a fact that, since Sudan gained its independence in 1956, Sudan and South Sudan have been at war - a civil war -the whole time."
"That is why it is now very important that, after the referendum, in which almost everyone - more than 98% - wanted independence for South Sudan, this peace process and process of independence is taken forward."
"Our task as Europeans is obviously to support democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, all of which are core values."
"In that respect, it is important that we are keen to strengthen these democracies and independence for South Sudan."
"(IT) Mr President, there is no doubt that the resolution adopted today represents an important indication of the cooperation and enhanced collaboration between the European Union and Russia."
"Economic governance; common spaces of cooperation in the fields of security, justice and freedom; and the fight against organised crime while safeguarding inviolable rights."
"North Africa and the Middle East require a joint approach and we are convinced that Russia can play a fundamental role in this context."
"This partnership and cooperation agreement, prepared for the summit of 9-10 June, will be able to stand as an important policy guideline in strengthening this cooperation, which we are confident will bring Russia membership of the World Trade Organisation, as well as encourage visa liberalisation."
"Meanwhile, Russia must play its full part, especially in the field of fundamental rights."
"(FI) Mr President, an extremely important document has now been adopted and I think that it is vital that we continue dialogue with Russia."
"For us, Russia is an important neighbour, and the better our relations are, the better it is for everyone."
"I would like to focus attention on the matter of visa waiver."
"I myself think that it is an important objective, but perhaps we should go slowly."
"As a representative of a neighbouring country, I can tell you that we cannot rush ahead too fast unless there are readmission agreements that work."
"In Russia, they obviously have to ensure that the dual identity that people could buy there previously can no longer be obtained."
"Instead, all these matters need to be dealt with properly by Russia so that we can move towards visa waiver."
"That is why we should not rush these things unnecessarily."
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to emphasise how at the bilateral summit, taking place today and tomorrow, there will be an important issue to confront; an issue, however, that seems to me to be missing from our joint resolution."
"In other words, I think that this summit could risk being overshadowed by a split on the prohibition of vegetable imports from Europe due to the E coli bacterium."
"Like the Commission earlier, I find it absurd that Russia should place an embargo on products that we consume every day and on which we carry out thorough checks."
"I think Russia's reaction is more of a political move, like many we have already seen in the past."
"I believe that my thoughts on this matter, including in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will be shared by fellow Members."
"I therefore think it would be a good idea to tackle this problem at the summit as well, including asking Russia to lift this disproportionate and unjustified import ban on European Union vegetables immediately, which, as such, is out of line with the principles established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), especially considering that Russia is a candidate for accession to the WTO."
"Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, has already announced that Russia will not lift the ban until the European Union has provided details on the source of the E coli infection."
"(PL) Mr President, the standards which apply in Russia are completely different from those which are in use in the European Union."
"It is sufficient to mention the questions of human rights and the right of association, or the ruthless use of natural resources to exert political pressure on other countries, such as those of the European Union."
"Construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline is a clear example of this."
"The negotiations which are in progress are a test for the European Union and the position we are going to hold in the future - that of partner or client."
"(LT) Mr President, President Lukashenko's policies have pushed him, along with his whole country, into deep self-isolation in relations with the West."
"Russia is quick to take advantage of this, and is aiming at taking over strategic and the most profitable Belarusian companies in exchange for loans."
"There is already talk of the introduction of a common currency (the Russian rouble)."
"The forthcoming EU-Russia Summit should be used to draw attention to the situation in Belarus."
"I am not talking about negotiations with Russia on Belarus, as this would only imply that Russia has some sort of 'special rights' to this country."
"However, we must warn Russia, at the highest level, that it is unacceptable to strengthen influence in a neighbouring country by exploiting a situation and negotiating with an authoritarian regime that does not represent the people."
"Only the Belarusian people themselves can reach a decision on the country's integration processes and only under conditions of democratic self-determination."
"(DE) Mr President, I think we can argue for a long time about the extent of Russia's progress on the road to democracy."
"Of course, there are many problems from our perspective."
"However, on the other hand, it is always better to develop our cooperation with Russia, in particular, when we are calling on Russia to respect human rights or to improve environmental rights, if only because of its size."
"If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights."
"Ultimately, this is all about improving the situation of the people of Russia."
"(SV) Mr President, resolutions like this one always use extremely diplomatic language."
"This time, I think we have been too mild in our assessment of relations with Russia."
"We know that the human rights situation in Russia is beneath contempt and we know that it is almost impossible for people to express their political opinions freely."
"We also know that there are many people in prison precisely because they have tried to exercise their human rights."
"That is unacceptable."
"Likewise, I think the choice of words with regard to energy policy is far too feeble."
"The fact is that the criteria we impose when it comes to the climate and the environment must also apply to imported oil or gas from Russia."
"We impose extremely high requirements on Norway, which imports gas into the EU, and exactly the same requirements should apply to Russia."
"(FI) Mr President, Russia is an important partner of the EU, and the EU would get even more out of its relations with Russia if the approach were genuinely strategic and sufficiently assertive between summits."
"Only then would we achieve results."
"There are three issues to consider."
"Firstly, there is Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation."
"Russia's WTO membership and free trade are in the interests of both the EU and Russia."
"Developments in the investment climate and the rule of law are essential components in Russia's forward development."
"Secondly, the EU and Russia have a common interest in the Arctic region, and that interest is important."
"The EU needs to strengthen its Arctic policy."
"Thirdly, visa waiver between the EU and Russia is the right goal."
"Russia, however, should improve its border controls and practices significantly and, in this respect, I support this very practical approach."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, while researching this subject, I realised that, paradoxically, given the size of the country, this is a question of particular concern in Switzerland, where there is a great deal of information and there are very many publications on the matter, whereas there is much less information coming from Europe."
"It will not be by chance that the problem, even following the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC, continues to affect a striking number of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers across Europe."
"Faced as we are with well over 400 petitions, as stated in a paragraph of the resolution, we find ourselves discussing this issue again in this Chamber."
"The problem lies in the fact that there continue to be cases of traders who unwittingly enter into contracts for valuable consideration for entries in a business directory."
"Those who merely skim over the forms and sign them without thinking and without close examination can be unpleasantly surprised how dearly it will cost them."
"In recent years, business practices similar to that just described have become widespread throughout Europe."
"They are difficult to combat effectively with the law as it stands."
"My vote in favour this morning was therefore intended principally to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises, which are great contributors to our economic system."
"(DE) Mr President, I am very pleased that we have discussed directory companies and their practices today."
"This is a very important topic in the European Union."
"Despite the fact that the Committee on Petitions has been working intensively on this subject since 2008, we have not yet seen any significant improvements."
"I would like to explain why the situation in Germany is so difficult."
"It is both mandatory and normal practice in Germany for a legal entity to register its address in an online directory when it is founded."
"Anyone who registers a company will receive around eight to 10 letters in response."
"It is likely that one of these will be genuine and the others superfluous."
"If you reply to the wrong letter and fill out the wrong form during this period of founding a company when you have a lot of work and a great deal of red tape to deal with, you will find that you have signed a contract and are faced with a bill for up to EUR 1 000."
"Therefore, I would like to urge the Commission, once again, to consider an EU-wide ban on these misleading business directories."
"(SV) Mr President, in general, we devote far too little time in this Parliament to the problems experienced by small businesses."
"A new form of fraud has developed in which small businesses are tricked into advertising in various types of directory."
"Then, when they discover that it is fraudulent, they receive a payment demand."
"The invoice is then passed on to a debt recovery agency and the amount grows and becomes three or even ten times as much in a very short space of time."
"The latest development is that these large established fraudulent set-ups are now operating across borders and it then becomes almost impossible for individual small businesses to receive justice."
"Instead, they are pursued by debt recovery agencies without being able to put a stop to it and without being able to report or get hold of the person responsible for the crime."
"In reality, this also means that the cooperation between European police forces must be strengthened, because we must have the ability to see these large-scale cross-border patterns, as this is not a question of small acts of fraud, but of large organised circles of fraudulent activity involving extremely large sums of money, running into millions of euro."
"Therefore, this is a good resolution, but it is far too weak and we need to take European cooperation further."
"(FI) Mr President, I asked to speak in the debate on Russia, and perhaps you will allow me to say a few words about it, even though we have gone past it."
"It is very important, I think, that we engage in dialogue with Russia."
"We need high-level meetings, but, as Europeans, in this matter we have to remember what the fundamental function of the European Union is."
"Our function is to take democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion forward in discussions with the Russians."
"These basic values need to be stressed."
"When we speak about visa waiver, that is a future objective, but now developments in democracy in Russia are the priority."
"Let Russia develop and set out on the road to democracy, with human rights and the rule of law being implemented as a consequence, and after that, we can return to this matter of visa waiver."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the few of you who are still here, visitors to the European Parliament, in conclusion, I would like to make some brief remarks on the subject of misleading directory companies."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution because it is important for us in the European Union to make our opinion clear on this."
"This is a part of organised crime in Europe which involves bogus companies taking money from people and from small and medium-sized businesses over the Internet."
"We must make every effort to prevent this from happening."
"The Commission has made many soapbox speeches calling for genuine support to be given to small and medium-sized companies and for the amount of red tape to be reduced."
"One important aspect of this is to bring an end to this type of organised crime."
"The resolution represents a step in the right direction, but only a small one."
"We must take action and, therefore, I am calling on everyone to continue with this work, not only those Members who are not here, but all of us who represent the citizens of Europe in Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to agree with the previous speaker."
"Quite often, it appears that whatever the problem, the answer seems to be from this place more EU and more regulation."
"Harmonisation versus mutual recognition, imposed EU contract law that adds an administrative burden to small businesses."
"But yet what we really should be focusing on is making the EU work better."
"Whatever your views on the EU, whether you are sceptical about further integration or you want more Europe, we should be focusing on making the EU and the Internal Market work better, but also tackling cross-border fraud."
"For years since I have been an MEP, I have been receiving letters and e-mails from constituents who have inadvertently been misled into signing up for a business directory, then being invoiced for a rather large amount of money."
"Rather than focusing on all the other stuff we focused on this week, let us make sure the EU works better."
"Let us focus on reducing the administrative burden for small and medium-sized businesses and let us help EU citizens who have been affected by this cross-border fraud."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on Sudan and South Sudan: The situation after the 2011 referendum."
"The Southern Sudan Referendum took place on 9-15 January 2011, with an overwhelming majority voting to establish an independent state of South Sudan, which is expected formally to declare its independence on 9 July 2011, which coincides with the end date of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)."
"This will be a very important day for South Sudan, as the creation of the new state will raise many difficult challenges."
"I welcome the resolution's call on the South Sudan authorities to promote the development of South Sudan as a modern, pluralistic, democratic state based on the rule of law and respecting human rights, in particular, women's and children's rights, and the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections."
"Although South Sudan has reserves of natural resources such as oil, copper and iron, as well as forest and fertile land, the vast majority of its population live in poverty, with one of the highest infant mortality rates and the lowest education indicators in the world."
"I therefore call on the future government of South Sudan to immediately take the necessary measures to help guarantee at least a minimum subsistence income, social guarantees and, above all, security for the populations of South Sudan."
"I am sure that the European Union will have to play an important role in the fight against poverty and in the revitalisation of Sudan's economy."
"I would therefore like to stress the importance of maintaining the Union's humanitarian aid to Sudan and to South Sudan."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The Southern Sudan Referendum took place on 9-15 January 2011, with an overwhelming majority voting to establish an independent state of South Sudan."
"South Sudan is expected formally to declare its independence on 9 July 2011."
"The European Parliament fully respects the outcome of the referendum as the expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan."
"I welcome the European Parliament's call for the government of South Sudan to enact policies on foreign investment in the interest of the population, so that foreign investment in natural resources benefits the development of the domestic economy in order to combat poverty."
"Money earmarked by the European Union for development aid should be used to support basic services, notably education and health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building, in order to ensure the development of South Sudan as a modern, pluralistic and democratic state, based on the principles of the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution as I support Sudan and South Sudan and congratulate them on their conduct after the referendum, which will help build a democratic state in peace with prosperity and security with regard to human, social and economic rights in both countries."
"In order to achieve this, we ask the parties to initiate a constructive dialogue to peacefully resolve the Abyei situation as well as the issues still to be negotiated, such as the distribution of oil revenues, boundary delimitation and debt distribution."
"To that end, the EU must make the necessary resources available to both countries to support social services such as education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building, and it should maintain this humanitarian aid for both countries after 9 July, the date on which South Sudan will officially gain its independence."
"I warmly welcome Parliament's resolution on Sudan and South Sudan, which reiterates full respect for the referendum of January 2011, sanctioning the independence of South Sudan."
"The resolution thus expresses support for the principle of the self-determination of peoples and recognises the right of the Christian community of South Sudan to establish a state for itself, free of the authority of the Muslim majority."
"The document emphasises the need for the two new states created by the partition of Sudan mutually to recognise the other's sovereignty and urges the adoption of measures designed to help consolidate and stabilise their presence on the path of democracy, respect for human rights and mutual recognition."
"Given that defence of the principle of the self-determination of peoples and protection of Christian minorities in the world are both fundamental features of Lega Nord's political theory, I can do no other than show my support for this resolution."
"in writing. - I voted against the provision of external aid to South Sudan of EUR 200 million in development cooperation in order to assist South Sudan to cope with the numerous humanitarian and socio-economic challenges in a context of reduced governance capacity and political fragility."
"As the EU is an undemocratic institution itself, and one that I strongly believe should not have a foreign policy agenda, I cannot endorse any third country activity by it."
"The UK is one of the world's largest donors of foreign aid."
"It is essential that foreign aid and foreign policy remain the remit of individual Member States and is not dictated at EU level, even if the recipient is in need and appropriate."
"In allowing the EU to forge a foreign policy agenda, there will come a point when we have a situation involving a third country that divides Member States and is not the unanimous wish of the Union as a whole."
"Such activity at EU level paves the way for increased competence with regard to external action, which is something I strongly disagree with."
"With regard to Parliament's response to the situation in Sudan following the 2011 referendum, which decided in favour of the independence of South Sudan from 9 July, I consider the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to be the most suitable, as I believe it represents a better approach to the political situation we are facing, as well as to relations with other African countries."
"The referendum carried out in Sudan sought to bring to an end the generalised violence that had been setting the populations of the north and south of the country against each other."
"Given the results of the referendum, the will of the people of South Sudan is now unequivocally in favour of independence, as has been repeatedly reiterated for many years now."
"My group has been monitoring this issue and, in particular, that of Darfur, over the course of several parliamentary sessions, and successfully sponsored the candidacy of the Sudanese lawyer, Salih Mahmoud Osman, for the 2007 Sakharov Prize."
"The awarding of the prize aimed to make the unconcealed outrage of the genocide in that country even more visible and to acknowledge the peaceful work of those who, against all odds, had not given up fighting for peace, solidarity and human rights."
"Unfortunately, Mr Osman's prize was not enough to stamp the international community with the desirable sense of urgency for confronting the repeated and serious human rights violations recorded in Sudan."
"I hope that, before and after separation, both parties can respect what has been agreed, build two peaceful countries, pull their populations out of poverty and promote good neighbourliness; and that the European Union may be able to contribute to that."
"The final results of the referendum of 9 January 2011 on the self-determination of South Sudan have confirmed, by an overwhelming majority, that the voters were determined to create an independent state."
"According to EU international observers, this referendum, whose results were announced by the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission and corroborated by the government of Sudan, took place in a fair way."
"I therefore advocate respect for the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan, and I urge Sudan and South Sudan to commit themselves actively to promoting democratic governance and establishing lasting peace, security and prosperity in both countries."
"I consider the provision of external aid very important and I welcome the Council's 23 May 2011 decision to allocate EUR 200 million to development cooperation in South Sudan, with the aim of contributing to the autonomy of local communities, and of attending to the basic needs of the people and to the non-existence of human resources and infrastructure."
"As we warned at the time, the independence of Kosovo set a dangerous precedent in relation to imperialist intervention in the creation of artificial states, in line with its geostrategic interests of accessing and controlling markets, natural resources and workforces."
"The case of South Sudan is similar to that of Kosovo in every way."
"Specifically, there was the holding of a referendum, financed and promoted by various powers, just in the part demanding independence, as was convenient, without the rest of the country's population unable to have its say."
"Added to all this, in the southern part of Sudan, there are large reserves of the oil that is fundamental to big international capital."
"The current situation, with the conflicts experienced in Sudan and in the whole region breaking out again, and the dispute over establishing its borders, demonstrates that the artificial creation of this country does not resolve any of the existing problems, nor will it improve the standard of living of millions of Sudanese people, but rather it will stir up contradictions and conflict."
"After the great imperialist powers have finished carving up the African continent in their own interests, everything points to the belief that a process has been restarted in South Sudan which will lead to more wars and suffering for the already severely devastated populations of Africa."
"in writing. - (SK) Following its independence, which is due to take place in exactly one month's time, South Sudan will be faced with numerous humanitarian and socio-economic problems at once."
"For a long time to come, assistance from neighbouring countries will be more important than ever to South Sudan as it seeks to fight poverty, strengthen local communities and accelerate the benefits of peace for the population."
"In the period immediately after the referendum, while the country will have access to multilateral sources of finance, there is a risk that a funding gap will be created that will make South Sudan highly vulnerable and very much at risk of a state collapse."
"I believe it is therefore essential that the European Union do everything in its power to help the Sudanese pull through this critical period and prevent an impending humanitarian catastrophe, because this country can begin to work systematically towards achieving its development goals only if confidence prevails in a peaceful future."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document because it calls on the South Sudan authorities to promote the development of South Sudan as a modern, pluralistic, democratic state based on the rule of law and respecting human rights, in particular, women's and children's rights, and the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections, with protection of freedom of movement, freedom of association and freedom to express one's political views enshrined in both the constitution and law."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which calls on both sides in Sudan, in the run-up to independence day on 9 July 2011, to present concrete plans on the setting-up and/or reform of their institutions in order for the two states to be viable as of that date."
"It also calls for the EU delegations in Sudan and South Sudan proactively to circulate and implement the recommendations of the recent EU election and referendum observation missions."
"We respect the outcome of the referendum on the independence of South Sudan, scheduled to take effect on 9 July 2011, as an expression of the democratic will of the Sudanese people."
"We hope that the political authorities will promote the development of a modern, pluralist and democratic state, based on the rule of law and respecting human rights; uphold the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections, with protection of the freedoms of movement, of association and the freedom to express political opinions."
"We agree, furthermore, that all the parties should engage in continued and constructive dialogue to address post-referendum issues, including common borders, citizenship arrangements for citizens both north and south, and the sharing of oil revenues."
"We agree, finally, on the need to allocate new European funds to support basic services, notably education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building."
"The EU must maintain its humanitarian aid for Sudan and South Sudan even after 9 July 2011, and all political parties must work together to represent all the people of the country fully and to help build stable and democratic political institutions."
"The conflicts in Sudan, specifically in the Darfur region, have claimed many victims over the years, particularly amongst the most disadvantaged people."
"Let us hope that the referendum will bring the conflict to an end and that we are finally entering into a process for a lasting peace."
"The EU is going to play an important role in future developments in that region and it cannot renounce its important role in bringing peace to the region."
"The security situation in the state of Abyei is very worrying."
"I would encourage the parties involved to engage in a peace dialogue by once again entering negotiations with the African Union."
"I would also call for a referendum to be held, as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)."
"Both the north and the south will have to work to resolve several crucial questions which have been left in abeyance, such as the drawing of the boundaries between the two countries, the dividing up of oil revenues, the use of pipelines, the issue of citizenship and the organising of popular consultations in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan."
"Support for South Sudan must be one of our priorities."
"We would encourage it to sign and to ratify the Cotonou Agreement, which will open the door to new prospects for cooperation."
"We would encourage it, along with Khartoum, to introduce a pluralistic and multi-ethnic democracy and an independent civil society, with a key role for justice alongside legislative and executive powers."
"We are delighted that we will be welcoming a South Sudanese parliamentarian once South Sudan has signed and ratified the Cotonou Agreement within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA)."
"We must continue to be attentive to the north; we must not ignore it or isolate it diplomatically."
"in writing. - The southern Sudan referendum took place on 9-15 January 2011, with an overwhelming majority voting to establish an independent state of South Sudan."
"The agreement to conduct the referendum was concluded by the government of Sudan and separatists from the south of the country in 2005 after 20 years of civil war."
"Governmental authorities representing the North signed the comprehensive peace treaty with the stipulation that the question of self-determination for South Sudan was to be resolved during the referendum."
"Since the situation in the region has deteriorated significantly recently, with this resolution we appeal to the government of the South Sudan to ensure democracy in the country and to demilitarise its territories."
"We also reiterate the importance of rendering humanitarian aid to Sudan and South Sudan and appeal to international creditors to alleviate the debt of Sudan and South Sudan."
"I would also add that it is necessary to strengthen monitoring, to deploy more experts, to render financial aid to the region and to arrange higher education in EU universities free of charge for talented youth."
"I voted in favour."
"In a referendum in January of this year, the people of South Sudan voted with an overwhelming majority in favour of independence and breaking away from the northern part of Sudan."
"It is important for the EU to respect the right of self-determination of these people without any restrictions and to recognise the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan."
"As this motion for a resolution clearly meets these requirements, I have voted in favour of it."
"Now it is important for the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to engage in a continued and constructive dialogue to address the issues which remain unresolved after the referendum."
"These include establishing common borders, citizenship arrangements for the citizens in the north and in the south, the fair distribution of oil revenues and the use of oil pipelines."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this resolution because it is very important to manage the armed conflicts and disagreements between both countries, to stop the unrest from spreading, and to reach and properly implement a Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"Both North and South Sudan must be governed on the basis of the principles of democracy and the rule of law, with respect for human, social and economic rights."
"Long-term peace and security must prevail in this region."
"Consequently, the protection and security of the people of Sudan must continue to be priority issues."
"Above all, the issue of the status of the Abyei region urgently needs to be addressed, under the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"If possible, it is very important for the EU to provide the required development assistance."
"We must make every effort to ensure that money earmarked for this assistance is used in a targeted manner for basic and essential services."
"Furthermore, the South Sudan Government should begin to enact foreign investment policies that would attract foreign investment in natural resources and would thus contribute to the policy of poverty reduction."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on Sudan and South Sudan because the referendum that took place in South Sudan, in which the majority of residents voted in favour of the creation of an independent South Sudan state, is proof of the democratic will of its citizens."
"After seven years of war, the majority of the population of South Sudan live in poverty and education indicators are the lowest in the world."
"I therefore welcome the EU decision to allocate EUR 200 million in aid to South Sudan in order to help the most vulnerable segments of the population."
"These funds must be allocated to education, health, agriculture and institutional capacity building."
"I welcome the extension of the UN Mission in Sudan and the deployment of additional peace-keeping forces because it is now particularly important to ensure the peaceful development of Sudan and South Sudan."
"The creation of the new state is a complicated process, where it is necessary to resolve very quickly the questions of establishing common borders, granting citizenship to populations from the southern and northern regions, and the distribution of revenue obtained from oil, etc. Having signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the countries should engage constructively in political dialogue."
"It is important to carry out a constitutional review in South Sudan so that all political parties work together to represent all the people of the new country and help to build stable, democratic political institutions."
"The results of the referendum in Sudan are an unequivocal indication of the desire of the people of South Sudan for independence, as they have been demanding for many years."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has been monitoring this issue and, in particular, that of Darfur, over the course of several parliamentary sessions, and successfully sponsored the candidacy of the Sudanese lawyer, Salih Mahmoud Osman, for the 2007 Sakharov Prize."
"The referendum aimed to bring the violence between the populations of the north and south of the country to an end."
"It is hoped that a new chapter will be opened at this stage and that two peaceful countries will be constructed."
"The EU can, and should, perform an active role to this end, namely, by helping to pull their populations out of poverty and by promoting good neighbourliness."
"This resolution, which I had a hand in drawing up, comes at a critical moment, and thus a key moment, in the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan."
"In January, the South Sudanese overwhelmingly voted for their independence in a referendum."
"In one month, a new state will be born."
"However, there are still several concerns, especially after the recent incidences of violence in the disputed Abyei region."
"More than ever, in this pivotal period, Parliament intends to reaffirm its complete support for the peace process and to appeal to the Sudanese and South Sudanese, as well as the international community, to remain committed to implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"In particular, the European Parliament is calling on the Sudanese and South Sudanese to propose specific plans taking account of sensitive subjects, namely citizenship, the sharing of debt and of oil revenues."
"These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained."
"Between 9 and 15 January 2011, the majority of South Sudan's population declared itself to be in favour of creating an independent state."
"It is common knowledge that this is an area of the globe which has been continually rocked by conflicts, jeopardising the possibility of large sections of the population enjoying decent living conditions."
"Faced with this new information, Parliament calls on the authorities of South Sudan - whose independence will be declared, starting from 9 July 2011 - to make efforts towards bringing together the essential foundations for establishing a democratic state anchored in human dignity."
"To this end, international support will be necessary."
"For this reason, I welcome the support the EU has pledged in order to help build this new state."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this resolution."
"in writing. - I am glad the EP welcomes the peaceful and credible conduct of both Sudan and South Sudan in the 2011 Southern Sudan Referendum, the efforts by all parties to the CPA and the commitment they have demonstrated to it; views this as a crucial step in implementing the CPA and as a positive sign for the peaceful coexistence of both countries; reiterates its full respect for the outcome of the referendum as the expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan; calls on both North and South Sudan actively to pursue the promotion of democratic governance and the establishment of long-term peace, security and prosperity for both countries, with respect for human, social and economic rights; calls on the South Sudan authorities to promote the development of South Sudan as a modern, pluralistic, democratic state based on the rule of law and respecting human rights, in particular, women's and children's rights, and the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections, with protection of freedom of movement, freedom of association and freedom to express one's political views enshrined in both constitution and law."
"Hundreds of people have been killed in the disputed area of Abyei between North and South Sudan."
"The UN recently announced that at least 20 000 people have abandoned the town of Abyei and fled to the south, following the withdrawal of the North Sudanese army from the area."
"As the joint motion for a resolution quite rightly says, both sides need to present concrete plans on the setting-up and/or reform of their institutions so that the two States are completely independent, to cease hostilities, and to promote democratic governance in order to establish long-term peace and security in the area."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Sudan and South Sudan because I support all development efforts being made by the EU in order to restore peace and reconstruct this long-suffering area."
"Recent developments in the area are raising concerns as regards compliance with the terms of the recent referendum on the independence of South Sudan, while the escalation of violence in Abyei, which is threatening to cause general destabilisation in the area, is a negative development."
"The African Union has an important role to play and, with the help of the EU and the UN, must keep its eyes open at this critical time so as to prevent any return to war."
"I welcome the Council announcement on more economic aid for South Sudan and I support the recommendation to maintain EU humanitarian aid to the area after 9 July."
"I consider that both proposals are necessary and will help in establishing South Sudan as an independent state and in any emergency that may arise."
"I think that the European Union and Russia must intensify their negotiations on establishing a partnership and on introducing a comprehensive agreement concerning the political, economic and social system and also taking account of all the issues associated with democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Enhanced cooperation and good neighbourly relations between the EU and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond."
"The EU and Russia are mutually interdependent, both economically and politically, and therefore, the conclusion of a Strategic Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation is particularly important for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners."
"In its relations with the Russian Federation, the EU must speak with one voice and show solidarity, particularly as regards safeguarding energy security."
"Russia's energy policy vis-à-vis Member States and countries in the common neighbourhood will show Russia's true readiness to follow the path of modernisation and democratisation."
"I welcome the European Parliament's requirement that the supply of natural resources should not be used as a political tool and that the principles of interdependence and transparency should be the basis of cooperation on energy security, together with equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment."
"I have voted in favour as I believe that the European Union and Russia must use the Nizhny Novgorod Summit to strengthen strategic cooperation and achieve a global cooperation agreement on the social, political and economic system and include issues relating to democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental and human rights."
"The summit must serve to review security and energy policy, which must be implemented on the criteria of interdependency, transparency, supply guarantees and the fight against climate change, as well as improved energy efficiency."
"It will be necessary to submit plants to stress tests and, in this respect, it is regrettable that the amendment calling for the immediate closure of Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors that continue to operate has not been adopted."
"I am voting in favour of the joint resolution on the EU-Russia Summit."
"The resolution contains the correct recommendations addressed to the European representatives who will be taking part in the summit, reminding them that the EU must exercise its political power to persuade Russia to assume its share of the responsibility for solving the problems that afflict the world today in the political, economic, geopolitical and environmental sphere."
"Russia is one of Europe's most important economic partners, not to mention a neighbouring country on which, inter alia, European energy policy depends."
"With my vote in favour, I am therefore joining in the appeal that this House is making to the EU representatives at the summit to work at this event to create a profitable and useful dialogue for both parties, leading to shared and effective solutions aimed at resolving the most important issues on the European and global political agenda."
"I welcome all the efforts made to strengthen and deepen good relations between the EU and other economic powers."
"In the case of EU-Russia relations, I welcome the achievements already made in respect of not just a common economic and cooperative space, but also of shared values."
"I consider the motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) the most suitable, given the current situation that has been presented."
"I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit as I think that relations with Russia need to be strengthened, especially in the area of energy security."
"The new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement must be comprehensive and legally binding and also include provisions on respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"I think that the Partnership for Modernisation is a suitable instrument for encouraging Russia to carry out reforms."
"I also believe that Russia joining the WTO will boost investments and improve trade relations with the EU."
"It is in our benefit to support Russia in its efforts to become a member of the WTO."
"On the other hand, Russia must show its willingness to abandon protectionist measures such as the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus."
"In the run up to the next EU-Russia Summit, which will take place on 9-10 June in Nizhny Novgorod, we are sending a clear message to the Member States: we must prioritise guarantees of respect for human rights over more ambitious agreements on trade, visas and cooperation."
"The European Union must make it clearer to Russia that it should respect its international obligations and commitments."
"Since 1994, there has been no change in our relations with Moscow, even though we clearly need to update our Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"That should go hand in hand with real progress in the area of democracy and the rule of law."
"Finally, it is unacceptable that the provision of natural resources should be used as a political instrument."
"The Russian Federation and the European Union have developed a close partnership, and the common fight against international terrorism stands as one of the many examples of this."
"In this context, I supported the resolution adopted today on EU-Russia relations before the summit on 9 and 10 June which will seek to establish a new strategic agreement."
"With this resolution, MEPs are sending a strong political signal to Russia: whilst greater economic, energetic, strategic and international cooperation between the EU and Russia is desirable, it should nonetheless be conditional upon efforts towards protecting human rights and civil liberties."
"Glances exchanged between Europe and Russia have always been characterised by mutual admiration and, simultaneously, by mutual fear."
"On the European side, it has been common to be in awe of the size, population and military might of Russia and frightened of Russian expansionism."
"For Russia, European scientific and technical progress has been emulated since the time of Peter the Great, but it has simultaneously been feared as something that could potentially destroy the Russian soul and way of being, and viewed as a threat to its territorial integrity."
"These trends were not dispelled but rather intensified by the Cold War."
"The path taken by Russia towards an essentially liberal, pluralist democracy has experienced both advances and setbacks, but it is undeniable that the country has come a long way since the days of the Iron Curtain."
"Nevertheless, there is no doubt that much remains to be done in this respect, and that the European Union and the Russian Federation not only share a historical, cultural and religious heritage, but that they also have common interests and challenges which warrant a closer relationship on many levels."
"The European Union should continue to work to make this convergence possible and fruitful."
"Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and shares responsibility for maintaining stability in the world with the EU."
"The challenges of the Middle East, Libya, Iran, terrorism, energy security, climate change and the financial crisis will be more effectively overcome if our relations with Russia are based on cooperation."
"However, three years after the conflict with Georgia, Russia is still not respecting the agreements of 12 August and 8 September 2008 relating to the withdrawal of its forces from the occupied Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and does not provide the European Union Monitoring Mission with free and total access to its territories."
"I therefore advocate that the EU and Russia must step up negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement based on the mutual interdependence of the EU and Russia."
"This agreement should be legally binding and comprehensive, and should encompass all areas related to democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human and fundamental rights."
"As usual, the interests of the large economic and financial groups in Europe are at the fore in this resolution."
"It is in this context that we must view the pressure put on Russia (which also occurs with several other countries) to join the World Trade Organisation, in order to promote 'a level playing field for business communities on both sides' and 'liberalise trade in the global economy', while facilitating foreign investment and renouncing any 'protectionist measures'."
"The resolution thus reels off the repetitive old EU primer of neoliberal and meddling policies."
"In this case, however, in addition to access to investments and markets, there is also the central concern of access to, and control of, sources and flows of energy, as well as other raw materials, especially rare earths, of which there is a serious shortage in the EU."
"Therefore, a call is made for 'close cooperation over the supply of raw materials and rare earths', especially those considered critical."
"So-called 'security' issues should also be noted, including 'the establishment of the missile defence shield'."
"We must remember that Romania, a member of the EU and NATO, has expressed willingness to host this system, which constitutes a threat to Russian security and to peace in Europe."
"The majority of the European Parliament is once again expressing its now standard neoliberal and meddling position on relations between the EU and Russia."
"The interests of economic and financial groups are prioritised, pressuring Russia to join the World Trade Organisation in order to promote 'a level playing field for business communities on both sides and liberalise trade in the global economy', with Russia having to facilitate foreign investment and renounce any 'protectionist measures'."
"Access to, and control of, energy are essential in this respect and therefore require access to markets, infrastructure and investment."
"There is also a certain sense of desperation when the call is made to Russia to engage in closer cooperation on the supply of raw materials and rare earths, especially those considered 'critical'."
"And, finally, there is hypocrisy."
"Russia is asked to engage in 'further comprehensive dialogue on security issues, including the establishment of the missile defence shield', when a Member State of the EU and of NATO, Romania, has already expressed its willingness to host this system, which clearly constitutes a threat to Russian security and to peace across Europe."
"Not even the United States has given any assurance that it does not."
"in writing. - (SK) The resolution deals with the preparations for the EU-Russia Summit to be held on 9 and 10 June 2011 in Nizhny Novgorod."
"The summit will focus on common challenges such as the economic and financial crisis, WTO accession, energy and issues related to energy security, long-term efforts to introduce visa-free travel between the EU and Russia, and other international and regional issues."
"Russia is a huge market for goods from the EU, of course, and it is also a major supplier of oil and natural gas to EU Member States."
"While Russian-EU relations have steadily improved in recent years, the parties involved continue to maintain a certain reserve and distance."
"I believe that, if appropriate action is not taken to remedy this situation, the EU's influence could slowly wane in both Russia and its neighbouring countries, with the risk that the Union would see its role restricted solely to that of a trading partner."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document because Russia, which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, shares responsibility with the EU for maintaining global stability, and because enhanced cooperation and good neighbourly relations between the EU and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond."
"The conclusion of a Strategic Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation remains of the utmost importance for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners."
"However, concerns remain about Russia's respect for, and protection of, fundamental and human rights, the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, political control of the media, repressive measures taken against journalists and representatives of the opposition and the fairness of elections."
"The document stresses the importance of energy security, and Russia's energy policy vis-à-vis Member States and countries in the common neighbourhood will show Russia's true readiness to follow the path of modernisation and democratisation."
"The supply of natural resources should not be used as a political tool."
"The principles of interdependence and transparency should be the basis of cooperation, together with equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment."
"I voted for this resolution and I should like to emphasise that Russia's energy policy towards the EU Member States and the countries of Eastern Europe will be a litmus test of whether and how genuinely Russia will be able to go down the path of modernisation and democracy."
"If the supply of energy resources is not exploited as a political tool, if it applies equal, transparent and non-discriminatory rules to all market players, if Russia makes an objective choice to make use of our existing mutual dependence in the field of energy in a collaborative way, based on specific, fair and legally binding principles, we shall be able to speak of a new era in the development of a united Europe."
"Of course, we must not forget and we cannot ignore various important issues, which continue to hinder the development of valuable relations between the EU and Russia, and especially, moreover, the fact that nearly three years after the war in Georgia, Russia continues to occupy a large part of the sovereign territory of Georgia, continues to ignore the agreement concluded in 2008, and fails to ensure proper access to these territories by the European Union Observer Mission."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit but I see no real progress from the Russian side to combat corruption, to apply the rule of law and international law."
"Declarative statements by President Medvedev are neither a proof nor a guarantee of real progress."
"I would like to remind you that whilst Russia is trying to join the WTO, it disregards, according to suitability, different international obligations, especially regarding human rights."
"Can the EU really trust a state that selectively applies international laws?"
"I call upon the EU to monitor the pre-election, election and post-election period very closely and make sure every violation is picked up and pointed out."
"Independent and transparent elections are the cornerstone of democratic states and if Russia wants to be among those, it has to fulfil the standards."
"Although the EU and Russia are interdependent, we see mostly the EU adapting to Russia's wishes."
"The EU has to stand strong and demand full and vigorous implementation of the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and an independent judiciary."
"Anything less means not living up to our own principles."
"Even more, we would let down the people in Russia who desire freedom, prosperity and safety."
"The Union needs a new openness in relations with Russia because many new challenges have arisen since the last EU-Russia Summit which we cannot overcome without improved cooperation."
"Today, the European Union is unanimous against the Russian policy of stirring up frozen conflicts and Moscow's attempts at interfering in the politics of independent states which were formerly part of the USSR, such as Georgia."
"With increasing anxiety, we are observing successive instances of attacks on freedom of the press and independent journalists."
"At meetings with the Russians, we must speak very firmly about press freedoms in Russia."
"It must be our priority to ensure that Moscow allows freedom of the press."
"However, I do not agree with the part which condemns the Russians for blocking the gay pride march in Moscow and not giving same-sex couples the right to marry or adopt children."
"I think that in respect of our approach to homosexual and lesbian movements, every country is fully entitled to pursue its own independent policy."
"The European Union respects the culture of its neighbours and should not intervene on questions of morality or axiology."
"Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for stability, security and prosperity for Europe and beyond."
"I hope that today's vote will lead to the adoption of decisive measures towards taking a common path based on transparency and the sharing of common missions to complete for the common good."
"I am referring to those measures necessary to prevent any breach of safety in Europe, including further cooperation on illegal immigration, improved controls at cross-border checkpoints and more effective exchange of information on terrorism and organised crime."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which reaffirms the urgent need for Russia to implement fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and media freedom as a basis for cooperation, and calls on Russia to take concrete action to improve its human rights record and to protect journalists, human rights activists, minorities and opposition representatives from violence and intimidation."
"Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond."
"We believe that what is needed is a comprehensive, legally binding agreement that concerns the political, economic and social system, and therefore includes all areas related to democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and particularly fundamental rights."
"As far as energy security is concerned, we are of the belief that the supply of natural resources should not be used as a means of applying political pressure, but must be based on the principles of interdependence and transparency, together with equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment, so as to establish a legally binding energy framework."
"We expect, moreover, further cooperation on illegal immigration, improved controls at cross-border checkpoints and information exchange on terrorism and organised crime."
"This report calls for Russia to 'renounce all protectionist measures' and threatens retaliation if Russia does not bend to this demand."
"It only envisages reciprocal free movement of Russian and European citizens happening in the long term, yet it supports the process of free trade that is under way."
"It does not criticise NATO's plan for a European anti-missile shield."
"This is arrogant imperialism."
"On the other hand, it fails to call on Russia to put an immediate stop to the Chernobyl-style nuclear reactors that threaten all of us."
"I am voting against this report, despite its calls for the democratic rights of Russian citizens to be respected, something which I support."
"This resolution on the EU-Russia Summit meeting envisages more ambitious trade relations, a new partnership and cooperation agreement and the liberalisation of the visa system, but Moscow has to provide guarantees with regard to improvements in the human rights situation in the country, and put an end to politically motivated judicial rulings, the lack of press freedom and the occupation of Georgian provinces."
"At this time, we ask the EU and Russia to take full advantage of this summit to step up negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement and to resolve the latest issues on Russia's World Trade Organisation membership."
"Another important aspect to bear in mind is the dialogue on the further liberalisation of the visa system, in view of the commitment to abolish these in the long run for travel between the EU and Russia."
"in writing. - 9 June marked the opening of the 27th EU-Russia Summit in Nizhny Novgorod."
"The European delegation was led by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy and the President of European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso."
"The Russian delegation was led by Dmitry Medvedev."
"One of the main topics of the two-day discussion was the Russian embargo on EU vegetable imports as a result of the recent outbreak of a dangerous intestinal infection in Europe."
"Russia's actions have caused a negative response in the EU."
"I very much share the concern of the Russian Government and I would like to see the Latvian Republic prohibiting imports of vegetables until the dangerous infection is eliminated completely."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament appeals to the EU and Russia to step up negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement and calls for Russia to implement all previous signed agreements and to solve the problem of non-citizens in Russia."
"I think that, firstly, Europe has to solve the problem of non-citizens in the Latvian Republic and only then make recommendations on this issue."
"Overall, I support the resolution and I voted in favour."
"In connection with the approaching EU-Russia Summit, the European Parliament has today adopted a resolution containing a proposal of the subjects which should be discussed at the summit."
"The document also draws attention to important challenges which should be the subject of cooperation between Russia and the European Union."
"Most of all, the fact should be emphasised that the EU and the Russian Federation maintain permanent relations and that their good relations as neighbours influence stability and security not just within the continent of Europe."
"In addition, both parties are dependent on each other in both economic and political terms."
"In the resolution which has been adopted, the European Parliament expresses the hope that during the EU-Russia Summit, it will be possible to make advances in the area of visa-free travel and energy security."
"Parliament also calls on the Russian Federation to demonstrate greater commitment in efforts to combat climate change, chiefly by reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"In the light of the forthcoming elections to the Russian Parliament, it is equally important that the elections be held in accordance with the principles established by the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"It is also necessary to raise the question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia, which is, after all, a member State of the Council of Europe."
"in writing. - (LT) Russia and the EU are linked both economically and politically."
"They are both responsible for maintaining global stability."
"Consequently, Russia and the EU must continue to enhance cooperation and develop good neighbourly relations."
"Only by using such measures will we be able to guarantee the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond."
"The Strategic Partnership Agreement is one of the main tools for implementing the goals outlined."
"In order to ensure that the agreement is properly implemented, both parties must comply with its conditions without exception and meet the commitments made, taking into account the protection of human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"I feel that the summit will remove obstacles regarding Russia's accession to the WTO."
"Russia becoming a full member of the WTO is an important step, which will create a favourable business environment for business operators from both parties and will facilitate and liberalise trade in the global economy."
"Attention is drawn to the fact that it is very important to address the issues surrounding the liberalisation of the visa regime, gradually introducing visa-free travel between the EU and Russia."
"Energy and nuclear security is another basis for strong and stable cooperation."
"The supply of natural resources cannot be used as a political tool."
"Furthermore, in order to prevent a nuclear disaster, Chernobyl-type reactors must be decommissioned as a matter of urgency and a bilateral agreement to comply with the highest safety standards must be concluded."
"I voted for this resolution and would like to emphasise that Russia will always be a very important partner of the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to establish strategic cooperation, sharing not only economic and commercial interests, but also the goal of close cooperation in Europe and internationally."
"I hope that this cooperation develops in accordance with the principles of respect, trust and solidarity."
"Europe includes a number of states that have come from the same mould and this should be taken into consideration when examining relations between the EU and Russia."
"These relations, between the most important European political union and the largest European state, are stalled."
"In short, Russia is an indispensable partner for the Union, not only economically but also politically."
"Therefore, the Union must strengthen the ties binding it to its most powerful neighbour by encouraging the facilitation of trade between the two states (which itself leads to political convergence) and strengthening the assertion of their inherent values."
"Russia shares responsibility with the European Union for maintaining global stability."
"Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond."
"Many challenges at international level, in particular, with regard to the Middle East, Libya, Iran, terrorism, energy security, climate change and the financial crises, cannot be overcome effectively without responsible and cooperative relations with Russia."
"I note that concerns remain about Russia's respect for, and protection of, human and fundamental rights, the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, political control of the media, repressive measures taken against journalists and representatives of the opposition and the fairness of elections."
"I therefore encourage our Russian counterparts to engage in these issues in an open and constructive way."
"in writing. - The EP: regrets that, contrary to Russia's obligations as a member of the Council of Europe to uphold freedom of assembly, peaceful citizens' gatherings continue to be banned and violently dispersed, including a gay pride march in Moscow for the sixth consecutive year, disregarding a final ruling made in April 2011 by the European Court of Human Rights; expects EU delegations and diplomats to actively implement the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of All Human Rights by LGBT People in the future."
"Russia is a neighbour and important partner."
"Dialogue between Russia and the EU should be extended to all sectors and we should move towards a strategic partnership for our common future."
"I consider that we have common interests with Russia, which we should utilise constructively in order to reach specific agreements on trade, on energy, in order to move towards a transparent and reliable energy policy, and on facilitating the movement of people between Russia and the EU, by making it easier to obtain a visa."
"Issues such as reducing corruption and consolidating the rule of law in Russia, in accordance with international rules, will help to cultivate stronger commercial and political ties and we anticipate developments in these sectors."
"We trust that Russia, too, will behave like a modern, democratic country."
"in writing. - (DE) In the split vote on paragraph 17 of this resolution, I voted against the second part."
"I believe that focusing on individual disadvantaged groups in society, as this paragraph does, is inappropriate."
"Other groups, such as those with differing political opinions, have their human rights violated and we must not tolerate this."
"The first part of the paragraph means for me that the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people can be protected, without losing sight of other groups, in order to ensure equal treatment."
"I endorse the principles of the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit."
"We should talk about the questions of the unresolved conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh."
"Russian activity in these regions is making stabilisation of the situation and a peaceful resolution impossible."
"Another very important question is the matter of energy sources and the costs which will be borne by EU Member States when paying Russia for them."
"A resolution to the question of the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU to the Russian market is urgent."
"In the summer period, its financial effects on producers are colossal."
"I do not agree, however, with paragraph 17 of the resolution, which attacks Russia for not giving gay and lesbian people the right to marry or adopt children, and neither do I agree with the condemnation of Russia for blocking the gay pride march."
"Granting such rights should be a sovereign matter for each country."
"Ways of life, traditions and models which are socially acceptable in some EU Member States are foreign to Russia."
"So the European Union, which respects the cultural traditions of Russians, should not put pressure on Moscow on this matter, and should leave the questions of the rights of sexual minorities to marry and adopt children in the hands of national legislation."
"In the last few years, the European Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning misleading business practices by certain business directory companies."
"These petitions have been sent by independent traders, voluntary organisations and family businesses which have fallen victim to misleading business directories."
"As the current directive on misleading practices has turned out to be insufficient, I voted in favour of this resolution calling on the European Commission to speed up the revision of this directive so that such misleading practices can no longer take place."
"This is not the first time that the European Parliament has discussed the issue of misleading business directories and the directories problem has often been brought up with the Commission and the Member States."
"I have often spoken on the matter in Parliament and I recently contacted the Commission to discuss all the complaints coming from my own constituency about Internet directory fraud schemes based in other countries."
"The fraud scheme people pretend that they are genuine directories and then they charge the businesses - which did not seek the service in the first place or realise that there would be a charge."
"Even though Directive 2006/114/EC is in place, not enough is being done by the Commission or the Member States to aid businesses affected by the fraud schemes or to eliminate the fraud schemes entirely."
"I support the resolution of Parliament, which draws attention to this issue, and again ask the Commission to take prompt measures to eliminate this misleading and destructive practice."
"The EU must protect the people and businesses of the Union from this fraud scheme which is far too prevalent."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The European Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies that are having a significant financial impact on thousands of mostly small businesses in the European Union."
"The practices in question typically entail luring businesses, as well as professionals and non-profit entities, into being listed in a business directory free of charge, although signatories later discover that they have signed up to a contract with a fee."
"As the business directory companies are often established in a different EU Member State from that of their victims, it is difficult for the latter to seek protection and/or redress from national authorities."
"Although the European Commission cannot demand that an individual or a company implement the provisions of the directive on misleading and comparative advertising, as Guardian of the Treaties, it must ensure that the directive is properly implemented in the Member States."
"I welcome the call for the Commission to take action, verifying the transposition of the provisions of the directive into Member States' national law and their proper implementation, and to take corrective action, where necessary, in order to stop misleading activities."
"I have supported this initiative as the Commission must ensure that Member States comply with Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions."
"However, either the directive is inadequate or it has been incorrectly enforced by Member States."
"Therefore, the Commission must immediately review and improve the directives in order to avoid these practices."
"My vote in favour of this resolution on the misleading practices of business directory companies represents a new phase in the long campaign conducted by the Lega Nord in defence of our entrepreneurs."
"The resolution denounces the exceedingly high number of scams carried out to the detriment of thousands of small businesses across the entire European Union and highlights the defective transposition by Member States of the 2006 directive on misleading advertising."
"With my vote, I fully support the appeal that the resolution launches to the Commission for the latter to face up to its responsibilities and its duty to scrutinise the actions of individual states, and for it to improve the existing legislation on business protection."
"in writing. - (CS) More than 400 petitions delivered to the European Parliament draw attention to the widespread misleading commercial practices employed by certain 'business directory companies', consisting of persuading businesses and also non-profit entities to register free of charge in a directory, only to discover that they have signed a contract that also entails a fee."
"However, directory companies are often established in a Member State other than the one in which their victims are based, making it difficult for the latter to seek protection or redress from national authorities."
"Regrettably, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions, fails to provide a sufficiently effective remedy or is inadequately enforced by Member States."
"Since the Commission is obliged to ensure that this directive is properly implemented by Member States, it should take stock of the situation, and, where necessary, take appropriate corrective action."
"In particular, it has a duty and a responsibility to stop the misleading commercial practices used by 'directory companies'."
"The production of some sort of blacklist of the misleading practices employed by these companies could be of at least some assistance here."
"in writing. - I voted against the motion for a resolution on misleading business directories as the UK operates its own misleading marketing regulations via the Office of Fair Trading, which controls the regulation of open and honest trade and contracts within the UK."
"However, such regulations do not encompass misleading contracts in other Member States."
"Yet homogenising EU law on the issue would undermine British competence in this area and also open up further channels for EU businesses to exploit the British market as they may be able to circumvent EU law."
"In the UK, the Chambers of Commerce and UK Trade and Investments offer access to secure business directories and networking opportunities through programmes such as the Overseas Market Introduction Service, Passport to Export and even the European Enterprise Network."
"It is paramount that these directories are given prominence in the UK market and are not expunged by allowing EU companies to flood the British market under the aegis of EU trade legislation."
"The misleading trading practices used by publishers of business directories chiefly affect small businesses, and so have substantial negative consequences for the sustainability and development of the economy."
"Therefore, and taking into account the constant recurrence of this problem throughout the EU, I welcome the draft resolution proposing to tackle such activities."
"in writing. - MEPs have received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies affecting thousands of mostly small businesses."
"The misleading business practices in question typically consist in luring businesses, as well as professionals and non-profit entities, into being listed in a business directory free of charge only for the signatories to later discover that they have signed a contract with a fee."
"Indeed, the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State, making it difficult for the victims to seek protection or redress from national authorities."
"I support this resolution."
"The directive on misleading and comparative advertising (2006/114/EC), which applies to business-to-business transactions, is insufficient in providing an effective remedy and is also inadequately enforced by Member States."
"The resolution urges the Commission to verify Member States' correct transposition, implementation and national enforcement of the directive and to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories."
"Misleading advertising and dishonest trading practices undermine consumer confidence and thus work to the detriment of the Internal Market."
"It is therefore vital that European legislation should protect consumers and businesses against this kind of practice."
"As regards misleading practices in business directories, which are common and have a disastrous effect on businesses, I consider it a good sign that the relevant legislation is being overhauled so as to put an end to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely through the creation of a blacklist of misleading practices used by business directories."
"The present motion for a resolution analyses the conduct of certain directory companies that behave unacceptably when they trick thousands of citizens and companies in the European Union."
"Regrettably, not only is Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising failing to obtain the hoped-for results, but the victims are, in particular, elderly individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and even charitable organisations."
"We are dealing with companies that are very aggressive in their tactics, real predators with no scruples, whose activity must be stopped as a matter of urgency."
"Since these practices are carried on across frontiers, it is very difficult to bring those responsible to justice."
"Moreover, there is no blacklist of these fraudulent companies, such as would help to prevent their practices, which meanwhile continue with the knowledge of the national authorities."
"European legislation has to protect European citizens."
"We cannot allow these companies to move with impunity from one Member State to another and even out of the EU, taking advantage of the principle of free movement of people and goods throughout the Schengen area."
"What we have before us is a very timely proposal which deserves my full support."
"The victims are waiting for practical results, and I hope that the Commission will take the measures necessary to bring this state of affairs to an end."
"As is mentioned in the resolution, the European Parliament has received more than 400 petitions on the subject of widespread misleading trading practices by publishers of business directories which affect thousands of businesses, mostly small ones."
"These practices have a significant financial impact overall."
"On the whole, the misleading trading practices in question consist of inviting companies, professional individuals and non-profit-making organisations to register free of charge in a business directory."
"Those who sign up discover only later that they have put their names to a contract with a fee attached."
"Furthermore, the publishers of business directories are often located in a different Member State from their victims, making it difficult for the latter to appeal to their national authorities for protection and/or justice."
"The Commission for Petitions regrets the fact that Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which is applicable to business-to-business transactions, seems either to fall short of providing effective counter-measures or to be insufficiently implemented by Member States."
"In the resolution that has now been adopted, the European Parliament calls on the European Commission to analyse the problem and work towards a solution, a request that has gained our support."
"These directory companies are clearly not only deceptive and misleading."
"They are also fraudulent, because anyone who lures lone traders and firms to their directory solely for their own benefit and enrichment is clearly engaging in malpractice."
"These directory company practices are also clearly outside the law, according to the directive on misleading and comparative advertising."
"However, I do not think we need to create new legislation."
"We need to try and put the law into practice as quickly and effectively as possible and to create conditions so that what are often small family businesses know how to mount an efficient legal defence."
"I understand that over 400 petitions relating to abuse of business directories have been received by the European Parliament."
"What usually happens is that a business registers with a directory to have the name of the business listed in it, believing that no fee is involved."
"Only later does the business learn that it must pay a fee."
"I fully support this resolution, which calls on the European Commission to properly implement the directive on misleading and comparative advertising."
"in writing. - Proper implementation and enforcement of the MCA Directive is essential to protect small and vulnerable organisations and business against unfair, misleading or aggressive marketing practices."
"Even though the directive covers business-to-business misleading advertising, its wider scope is to protect consumers' interests, to safeguard smooth functioning of the Single Market and to significantly improve citizens' lives."
"I have seen some improvement, but I still believe that much has to be done in order to stop unfair misleading practices."
"Businesses in Europe are still victims of abusive misleading behaviour leading to significant financial losses mostly for small business and start-up business."
"Due to the inaccurate transposition of the directive, I fear that there is still little coherence from one Member State to another in the way in which these unfair practices are regulated."
"If the situation does not improve, further actions are required."
"There is a need for closer collaboration and coordination between the Commission and Member States in order to better implement and enforce the directive."
"There is also a need for better dissemination of information and training, in particular, to small businesses and public servants."
"Flexible rules for sanctions, complaints and compensation mechanisms are necessary in order to adapt to the changing market conditions and new market practices."
"With the adoption of today's resolution, the European Parliament has once again called for protection for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Practices in which firms are offered a listing in a business directory while the false impression is given that it is a free service are becoming increasingly common."
"Unfortunately, when the facts are revealed, it turns out that in reality, the enterprise has undertaken to pay a fixed sum for a certain period of time."
"This type of practice has been the subject of complaints made to the European Parliament by businesses."
"This is why we also want the European Commission to check how the Member States have implemented the provisions of Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising."
"The European Parliament is also demanding that the question of misleading business directories be included in a review of that directive."
"In the resolution which has been adopted today, we return, too, to a proposal which has already been made in the resolution adopted by Parliament in 2008 on the same matter, namely, the idea of creating a blacklist of dishonest practices employed by businesses which operate business directories."
"I hope the European Commission will not drag its feet over taking the appropriate steps to protect small and medium-sized businesses from these dishonest practices."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document because Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies that are having a significant financial impact on thousands of mostly small businesses in the European Union, and Parliament continues to receive petitions and complaints about business directory companies."
"The misleading business practices in question typically entail luring businesses, as well as professionals and non-profit entities, into being listed in a business directory free of charge, but signatories later discover that they have signed up to a contract with a fee."
"The business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from that of their victims, making it difficult for the latter to seek protection and/or redress from national authorities."
"The Commission is urged to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving Directive 2006/114/EC and other relevant legislation in order to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories"
"in writing. - (CS) The motion for a resolution tabled in response to oral question B7-0315/2011 on misleading business directories, while brief, encompasses two areas requiring constant attention."
"The first area is the support of small and medium-sized enterprises by EU bodies and institutions, in the context here of protection from misleading commercial practices; the second area is the protection of competition by preventing widespread unfair competition, which includes misleading and comparative advertising."
"We should welcome the anticipated efforts of the Commission, which, under the resolution, is urged not only to revise and improve Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, but also to take corrective measures against the patchy enforcement of this directive by EU Member States."
"Misleading advertising and dishonest trading practices are bad for the Internal Market."
"We therefore must legislate to protect consumers and businesses from this kind of practice."
"in writing. - Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies, affecting thousands of mostly small businesses in the European Union, with a significant financial impact."
"Parliament continues to receive petitions and complaints about business directory companies."
"The misleading business practices in question typically consist of luring businesses, as well as professionals and non-profit entities, into being listed in a business directory free of charge."
"Signatories later discover that they have signed up to a contract with a fee."
"The business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from that of their victims, making it difficult for the latter to seek protection and/or redress from national authorities."
"The European Parliament urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving Directive 2006/114/EC and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories."
"I fully agree and I voted in favour."
"In recent years, there has, unfortunately, been a growing trend towards unfair business practices and misleading advertising."
"In the past, it was generally consumers who were the targets of these scams, but now the fraudulent practices are extending into the business world."
"The problem is that these fraudulent activities generally take place across national borders, which makes it harder to arrest and prosecute the criminals."
"Some of the companies constantly change their names and their P.O. box addresses and this also makes it difficult to arrest the people who are pulling the strings."
"Therefore, it is important for us to close the loopholes in this area so that we can take action against fraud more effectively."
"However, the measures should be directed not only at the business world and not only, as in the specific case covered here, at the misleading commercial practices of directory companies."
"Decisive action must also be taken against the various forms of fraud aimed at consumers."
"I see this petition as a step in the right direction, which should be followed by further measures, and, therefore, I have voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (LT) I welcome this resolution because we must encourage honest business practices and halt the spread of misleading business practices."
"To that end, we must set out effective means for redress."
"Currently, most companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, suffer significant financial losses as a result of such misleading activities."
"Enterprises receive inaccurate business propositions and they are entrapped into unwanted contracts for advertising in business directories."
"In this case, national authorities are unable to provide adequate protection or redress because the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State from the businesses affected."
"This enables business directory companies to abuse the current situation unopposed."
"In order to stop such dishonest activities as soon as possible, the Commission must compile a blacklist of misleading practices by business directories and adopt relevant legislation, focusing, in particular, on the provisions of the directive on misleading and comparative advertising and the implementation of these."
"I believe that we must create the right conditions for cooperation between the Member States' national authorities, which would facilitate the application of administrative or legal measures across borders."
"The European Union must implement these measures for the Internal Market to be able to function normally, for consumers to be protected, and for business operators to be able to engage in fair business practices."
"in writing. - I voted for this motion for a resolution because it has clearly pointed out the current situation of misleading business practices, which are already against EU law, and that the international dimension of the fraud makes it difficult for the victims to pursue and fight against the fraudsters."
"I believe that vulnerable small businesses and professionals need to be protected from the misleading business directories, and thus the EP and the EU as a whole must show that European law is there for everyone to follow and respect."
"Therefore, I fully support this resolution that calls on the Commission to proactively verify Member States' transposition, implementation and national enforcement of Directive 2006/114/EC and take corrective action where needed."
"The Commission should also speed up revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation to end the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible."
"This European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2011 on misleading business directories warns the Commission of the need to step up its activities regarding the revision and improvement of the directive and other relevant legislation in order to put an end, as soon as possible, to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely, through the compilation of a specific blacklist of misleading practices used in business directories."
"According to the rapporteur, Parliament has received more than 400 petitions concerning misleading trading practices."
"Such practices threaten the healthy functioning of the Internal Market, first because consumer confidence is essential to the healthy functioning of the economy and, more importantly, because the practice in question should be made illegal."
"The matter is of such importance as to have already warranted legislative intervention by the Union."
"However, in view of the results that are now known, the Commission must be urged to supervise the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC and, at the same time, to test its limits with a view to its improvement."
"Regrets that Directive 2006/114/EC(2) on misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions, appears to be either insufficient in providing an effective remedy or inadequately enforced by Member States; 2. Recalls that, although the Commission has no power to enforce the directive directly against individuals or companies, it does have a duty to ensure that the directive is adequately implemented by Member States; 3."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution as part of a sensible reaction by European politicians from 27 countries to this fraudulent behaviour."
"For too long, companies, especially in my region of the South East of England, have been targeted by this unscrupulous practice."
"I have been told by constituents that they have been invited to advertise their business for no costs only to receive a large invoice with legal threats not long after."
"This practice heralds from Spain but could happen elsewhere."
"The local authorities in Spain should do far more to take on such tricksters and prosecute those involved in fraudulent behaviour."
"The number of complaints which Parliament has received concerning misleading business directories and the fact that they are often cross-border in nature demonstrate that there is a need to improve EU regulations in this area."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution and the call for an improvement to the legal situation that it contains."
"However, action needs to be taken in the meantime in order to prevent the number of businesses affected rising still higher."
"A strategic information campaign is needed in order to pull the rug out from under these profiteers."
"It is important that offers for inclusion in directories be examined extremely thoroughly and carefully, particularly if they are allegedly free of charge."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Madagascar (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on Madagascar."
"author. - Mr President, the illegal and unelected regime of Andry Rajoelina is riddled with corruption and has orchestrated serious human rights abuses in Madagascar, yet Rajoelina came to power pledging an end to corruption and human rights abuses that allegedly flourished under the ousted former President, Marc Ravalomanana."
"This irony cannot be lost on the long-suffering people of Madagascar, many of whom live in abject poverty."
"The EU now needs to consider a substantial reinforcement of targeted measures against Rajoelina and his henchmen and cronies and, if necessary, to invoke the Cotonou Agreement's provisions on failures of governance and to apply the necessary sanctions."
"The African Union (AU) could do far more."
"We have heard many platitudes from the AU, but we have seen little concrete action so far."
"Such action should include brokering an agreement between Rajoelina and Ravalomanana, allowing the former president to return to Madagascar without any risk or prejudice."
"Rajoelina should also allow his rival to stand in the presidential election planned for September this year."
"Sadly, the portents for stability and reconciliation in Madagascar are not good."
"I hope that in the next few months, matters will be resolved peacefully."
"Mr President, this is not the first time that we have discussed the drama in Madagascar in this Chamber."
"Things have hardly changed for the people of Madagascar since the resolution in February 2010, except for the worse."
"They are the focus of my concerns, as they are the main victims."
"Beyond that, we are now seeing an apparently never-ending power struggle being played out."
"More than a year ago already, the European Parliament clearly expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which could lead to elections."
"That has still not transpired."
"Rajoelina is still in place."
"As we restate in this resolution, he must not be able to stand in new elections - that must be made clear."
"I would simply like to ask for the negotiations in progress with the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which have not yet produced a conclusive result, to be given a chance to do so."
"That is why I would opt for a measured tone in relation to the situation so that we leave an opportunity for negotiations, which should take place very urgently and, I hope, reach a conclusion."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, just for once, today, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left can only regret the tone of the resolutions before us."
"This is particularly true of the resolution on Madagascar."
"I have already had occasion to deplore this and other resolutions, in February 2010, when the previous urgent resolution on that country was adopted."
"In that country, as in many others in Africa, the European Union is demonstrating its political impotence, and we are not going to change things by calling for harsher economic sanctions to be imposed on that country."
"The only victims of the situation are, and will continue to be, the people of Madagascar, who do not need this."
"We would have preferred it if the European Parliament had sent a clear message of support to the mediator of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who has worked hard for a year to try to find the most amicable solution possible."
"We would have preferred a message congratulating Mr Chissano on his mediation work, which led him to present a road map to the SADC for the resolution of the political crisis in Madagascar."
"A new meeting of the SADC is to be held in Johannesburg on Saturday in the presence of all the representatives of the different strands of political opinion in Madagascar to ratify this road map."
"We wish to make a plea for the people of Madagascar and to reiterate that it is up to them, and them alone, to decide, without international pressure, who governs them."
"The role of the European Union is to help them."
"We do not therefore wish to be associated with this partial resolution, which risks adding fuel to the fire instead of supporting the efforts of the SADC, and we refuse to support the imposition of harsher economic sanctions."
"Mr President, just as the previous speakers have also mentioned, I, too, wish to say that since February 2010 when we discussed the situation in Madagascar, we have seen no progress."
"We could say that the transition has taken place not to democracy, but to an even deeper crisis than a year and a few months ago."
"The Southern African Development Community meeting in Gaborone was admittedly presented as a final chance."
"Unfortunately, we have all seen that it was a failure."
"I believe that we can retain the hope that during the meeting this weekend, on Saturday, there will still be some positive developments."
"On the other hand, it is true that Madagascar's economic and social situation is extremely dire, with the majority of the Madagascan population living on less than USD 1 per day."
"How can they get out of this situation?"
"Through a neutral, inclusive and consensual transition process."
"We are not here to give our backing to one side or the other, but to support the idea of this kind of process."
"Mr President, following the coup d'état, Mr Rajoelina's government has turned Madagascar into a hub of political instability."
"It is a country where there is no separation of powers, the media are controlled by the government, human rights are violated and there are abuses by the current Malagasy security forces against the people of Madagascar and it is they who have directly suffered from the political consequences."
"This illegal regime is causing enormous humanitarian problems in a resource-rich country through the lack of basic foodstuffs, water and sanitation, health and education services."
"The European Union must continue with its humanitarian aid to the people and must contribute to finding an agreement between the parties that facilitates a neutral transitional government, which is consensual and inclusive, in order to restore constitutional order and call free and transparent democratic elections that allow all political movements and leaders to participate freely and let the Malagasy people decide their future."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance once again deplores the conditions under which Mr Rajoelina came to power in Madagascar."
"The political situation of that country, which is very unstable, is extremely worrying."
"There have been numerous human rights violations: violence against demonstrators, illegal arrests, arbitrary detentions, as well as abuses against journalists and political opponents."
"The security forces enjoy total impunity."
"Leaders of opposition political movements have been imprisoned."
"We are demanding their release."
"In addition, the uncontrolled management of the country's natural resources threatens prospects for development for future generations and paves the way for an ecological disaster."
"We condemn the illegal exploitation of the mineral resources as well as the pillaging of precious wood, particularly rosewood."
"The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and foremost, the European Union."
"In our resolution, we condemn the human rights violations and abuses by the Malagasy security forces against their own population, and call for the dissolution of political militia, for full respect for human rights, as well as civil, political, social and economic rights, and for the restoration of the rule of law."
"We call for the immediate release of political prisoners and for the direct return of political exiles."
"A return to constitutional order is a condition for the return to normality in Madagascar."
"What is needed are free, transparent and fair elections organised under the supervision of the international community and which will comply with democratic standards."
"Our main dilemma concerns how to increase humanitarian aid to the people of Madagascar, since we do not recognise the unconstitutional regime."
"I hope that in spite of this, such help can be effective."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, two years have passed since power was taken by force in Madagascar by a military regime that has not fulfilled at all the commitments made to ensure a transition to democracy, political pluralism and freedom of expression."
"The fact that the African Union has suspended the country's membership, declaring the political regime illegal, along with the suspension of assistance by the IMF and the World Bank, have led to the government's international isolation and deepened the problems of a population deprived of foreign aid."
"Therefore, our proposal for a resolution outlines two sets of measures: an appeal to the EU and also to the Security Council to extend to all the member countries the visa ban adopted by the African Union and also to increase humanitarian aid to the civilians in Madagascar."
"Politically, the EU should insist more strongly that political parties in Madagascar rise above their obvious conflicts and agree on the road map proposed by the Southern African Development Community to overcome the crisis."
"In this respect, a decision by the former President Marc Ravalomanana to return to his country is essential, taking into consideration the fact that the current leaders are forcing him to choose between exile and forced labour for life."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, a military coup d'état in Madagascar has been followed by continual violations of human rights and civil liberties."
"We have had to witness the concentration of executive, legislative and judiciary powers, together with the media, in the hands of Andry Rajoelina, who prides himself on the title of the President of the High Transitional Authority."
"I am pleased that the EU and its Member States have not recognised his illegitimate government."
"We should never give credit to any authoritarian ruler by engaging in formal relations, even if we have done so in the past."
"Therefore, I welcome the sanctions that have so far been imposed on the regime, and encourage the international community to extend them in order to overthrow Rajoelina's government and bring about a true and definitive transition to democracy."
"(RO) Mr President, the coup d'état which took place in March 2009 has been followed by acts of violence, human rights violations, including the random arrest of opposition leaders, and internal insecurity."
"These matters must be investigated and their perpetrators punished."
"The regime is boycotting the international and regional efforts to restore peace and organise free elections for a legitimate, democratic government."
"However, the efforts to find solutions must not be abandoned."
"In addition, the political militia must be disbanded, as a matter of urgency, and the abuses carried out by the government's security forces against the population ended."
"It is vital for free, democratic elections to be organised as soon as possible so that legitimate constitutional order can be established and the country's reconstruction can get under way."
"This is why I call on the Commission and Council to continue their efforts and step them up more quickly so as to provide solutions and the environment for organising free elections and protection for human rights in Madagascar."
"(FI) Mr President, the people of the world's fourth largest island have been suffering since the military takeover in 2009."
"Madagascar has an illegal government in power which the people have not elected."
"Even its natural riches and renewable natural resources have failed to promote prosperity."
"The Madagascans live in squalor and poverty on their island."
"Repeated violations of human rights, the harassment of politicians, religious people and civil society, frequent arbitrary arrests, the looting of churches and the intimidation of the press are everyday occurrences in the country."
"The list could go on to include media censorship, keeping the nation in poverty, unlawful arrests, disappearances and torture."
"In addition to the human suffering, Madagascar's biodiversity is under threat."
"The island's flora and fauna have evolved in isolation and are irreplaceable and unique, when considered globally."
"The nation must be able to decide its future itself, and the European Union has to be involved in supporting the Madagascans in every way possible."
"Mr President, the situation in Madagascar is the classical situation where the new is no better than the old."
"This illegal regime came into power in 2009 with military support and matters have not improved one bit."
"So all the old bad habits remain: unlawful killings, mental and physical torture of prisoners, overcrowding and pre-trial detention are rampant, and, of course, poverty abounds with the minimum wage of USD 35 per month."
"The solution is obvious."
"We need a democratic regime there and we at the European Union must do our best to establish that because, without that, progress cannot be made."
"If we can get free elections and a new government in place, the European Union, in conjunction with other international bodies, particularly the African Union, can help nurture this country along on the road to democracy and the road to economic recovery."
"(FI) Mr President, since the transfer of power in March 2009, the political situation has continued to be unstable, and there have constantly been new disturbances in Madagascar."
"Rajoelina's administration breaches human rights and oppresses its own citizens."
"In May 2011, representatives of the Africa Caribbean Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) group took the view that Madagascar should have a viable temporary administration, and soon."
"Right now, an attempt is being made to resolve this crisis, and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has invited 11 Madagascan political parties to a summit in Botswana."
"Three of the main opposition parties, however, have rejected this road map, because it would allow Rajoelina to continue in power until the next elections."
"Up till now, Rajoelina has reneged on all earlier possible attempts at agreement."
"Why, then, should he be trusted this time?"
"That is why the EU and the international community must intervene in the situation, and this illegal government headed by Rajoelina should be brought to an end."
"(PL) Mr President, the cause of the current political crisis in Madagascar was a military coup d'état, which forced the democratically elected President of Madagascar, Marc Ravalomanana, to resign and go into exile two years ago."
"The seizure of power by the military was strongly condemned by the international community, including the European Union, which immediately cut off development aid."
"In addition, Madagascar was suspended from the Southern African Development Community and the African Union, which contributed to further isolation of the island."
"The political crisis in Madagascar is just reaching a crucial point, in which there is the opportunity that the negotiations which are in progress between the political leaders will bring about an end to the crisis."
"This is an ideal opportunity to restore constitutional order and call new elections."
"The talks also have fundamental significance for the restoration of funds to the country, which had payments of over EUR 600 million in EU development aid suspended."
"I hope the sides which have been in conflict will now manage to introduce a road map which will provide for the establishment of an interim government until new and - I trust - fair elections are called."
"(PT) Mr President, I wish first of all to deplore the delay in providing the Portuguese versions of this afternoon's resolutions."
"Some of these are still not available as I speak, and I therefore wish to register my strong protest."
"Regarding the situation in Madagascar, the European Union may give its support to a process of reconciliation, but it must do so without intervening or interfering in matters which only the Malagasy people can decide."
"Above all, the European Union must refrain from taking sides in the conflict."
"All our efforts should be in the interests of the Malagasy people and not of any one of the conflicting parties."
"It is important to value and follow up the efforts of the Southern African Development Community to resolve the conflict and find a political solution to the crisis in the country."
"For our own part, we wish here to reaffirm the necessity of respecting the ability of the Malagasy people to choose and determine their own future."
"(RO) Mr President, the current political crisis in Madagascar poses a risk to democracy and stability in the region."
"The removal from power of the democratically elected president has resulted in a climate of violence and insecurity being imposed."
"I should remind you that international donors have withdrawn the financial support given to the island's population."
"This means that Madagascar is now faced with a poverty rate of 80%."
"The US has stopped offering tax exemptions to the textile imports from this country for the same reasons."
"This has resulted in the disappearance of one of the main sources of national income."
"I welcome the efforts of the Southern African Development Community to put an end to this crisis and restore democracy in the country."
"I think that it is vital to involve regional organisations in resolving these tensions in order to reach a political compromise."
"(RO) Mr President, the political crisis in Madagascar has led to this country being isolated on the international stage."
"Financial aid to Madagascar has been suspended by the European Union, through the enforcement of the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement, as well as by the IMF and World Bank."
"I support the measures adopted by the European Union in a situation where the transition to a democratic system is being jeopardised indefinitely by the illegal and, by extension, unconstitutional way in which Rajoelina took power."
"On the other hand, the decision to apply sanctions is always difficult due to the inevitable humanitarian, economic and social consequences triggered by this."
"We must think about the Madagascan people, who need our support."
"This must be demonstrated not only by appealing for free, pluralist elections to be organised and democratic order to be restored, but also, in practical terms, by providing proper humanitarian aid."
"(IT) Mr President, it is only since July 2003 that Madagascar began again to take an active part in the life of the African Union, since until the end of the 1990s, its political and economic ties were predominantly with the non-aligned socialist countries."
"The military coup d'état of March 2009, however, saw the former mayor of the capital city install himself in the presidential palace, which had already been occupied by the army that supported him."
"After 19 months of institutional crisis in the country, precisely on the day on which nearly 8 million Malagasy people were called on to vote on reforming the constitution, in November 2010, all hope of fashioning a genuine democracy in this former European colony was lost."
"Today in Madagascar, there is a transitional government that nevertheless holds no promise of anything good, either on an economic level, if we consider that people there live on less than one dollar a day, or on a humanitarian level."
"Since, until now, neither the European Union nor the African Union have managed to achieve any compromise with the government of Madagascar, certain measures have been adopted, including the suspension of aid from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as our withholding recognition of the transitional government."
"We condemn the coup d'état and stress the urgent need for free and transparent elections, monitored by the international community."
"Mr President, I have great respect for you, but surely it is up to the speaker the speed at which he chooses to speak, and that should be the choice of the speaker."
"The speakers in this Parliament should not run the risk of having their speech wrecked by interruptions from the Chair on behalf of the interpreters."
"Could I put that point to you?"
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Lord Dartmouth, to a large extent I agree with your view, but we also get indications from our interpreters that they cannot keep up with the pace."
"Of course, when I interrupt the speaker, I always give him the additional time, so everybody is happy - the speaker is happy, you are happy that you get the interpretation, and, of course, our interpreters are happy as well."
"That is the purpose of the work we are doing here."
"(Applause)"
"(FI) Mr President, since the military takeover in March, political instability and a deteriorating humanitarian situation have been becoming ever more obvious features of everyday life for the Madagascans."
"With the political crisis, they have even more difficulties accessing basic foodstuffs, water, hygiene products and health services."
"Those currently in power have illegally monopolised executive, legislative and judicial power, and have taken control of the media."
"The country's security services are guilty of violence against ordinary people."
"Many activists have been imprisoned for political reasons, and former leading political figures have had to flee the country."
"The negotiations that are in progress must be stepped up fast, and a way must be sought to restore constitutional order."
"The human rights violations call for impartial investigation."
"The EU should increase humanitarian aid for Madagascar, and targeted sanctions should be continued until a solution to the political crisis has been found."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission and Baroness Ashton, the High Representative, are deeply concerned about the situation in Madagascar and we have promised to give our continued support to the people of this beautiful country."
"We attach great importance to overcoming the ongoing political crisis and the economic and social effects on the population of Madagascar which are increasing the burden placed on the people on a daily basis."
"In the same way as you, the Members of Parliament, we are monitoring developments there very closely and using every diplomatic means at our disposal to bring an end to the crisis."
"The last two years have involved many retrograde steps and blocks to progress in the country."
"Now I believe that we have reached a turning point."
"Two days ago, on 7 June, talks began in Gaborone between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and various players in the country, in order to find a way out of the crisis, which is based on neutrality and consensus, includes all the relevant groups, and can be supported both by the international community and by the broad majority of the citizens of Madagascar."
"We are hoping for, counting on and working to ensure the success of the talks, so that the African Union and the international community, including the EU, can help and support Madagascar to return to the rule of constitutional law."
"We are opposing all attempts to bring about a transition to a one-sided, 'de facto' government."
"For this reason, the European Council decided last week to extend the measures imposed under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement by another six months."
"This does not affect humanitarian aid or measures to combat poverty, provided that they are compatible with the terms of this article."
"We are still prepared to provide political and financial support for this transition process, provided it is consensual."
"It must be based on the road map agreed by the local players and must be endorsed by the SADC, the African Union and the international community."
"Against this background, I am hoping for positive developments after two tough and difficult years. Thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"For several months, the whole of Europe has been looking at the situation in the countries of North Africa, watching events which are taking place in our immediate neighbourhood with unconcealed anxiety."
"Today, we return to the question of another African country, which, for a long time now, has been lost in chaos and political oblivion."
"Madagascar has become a lawless state in which an illegal regime is allowing the country to be plundered and engulfed in chaos."
"The regime's repression and disregard for the rights of its own citizens can only aggravate the situation, and this may unfortunately lead to bloodshed."
"Therefore, although the call for the restoration of constitutional order and the holding of open and free elections under the supervision of the international community may appear to be nothing but demagoguery, it is, in fact, the only way for the situation in Madagascar to return to normal."
"We must also remember that although sanctions may prove successful, they should go hand in hand with a specific proposal for a solution to the political crisis, because the longer the current situation continues, the harder it will be in the future to bring the rule of law to Madagascar."
"2."
"Guantánamo: imminent death penalty decision (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on Guantánamo: imminent death penalty decision."
"author. - Mr President, the ECR Group believes that capital punishment is a personal conscience issue for each MEP and, although we acknowledge the EU's common position opposing execution in all circumstances, the fact of the matter is that many millions of European citizens, our constituents, are still in favour of capital punishment."
"Furthermore, this resolution refers to the potential death penalty being imposed on some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, who thought nothing of conspiring to murder thousands of innocent people."
"Indeed, when reading this resolution, I thought of my own constituents who were mercilessly blown up by al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in London six years ago."
"The struggle against global Islamic terrorism is an asymmetric war with unforeseen results and unprecedented consequences, and new jurisprudence internationally is now needed to address this."
"The detention camp in Guantánamo Bay is a reflection of this tragic situation."
"It is also a reflection on the fact that the United States is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden for the global war on terror."
"Of course, all such trials by the US authorities - which, after all, is a country that is a democracy and shares our common values - must nevertheless be conducted fairly with all legal safeguards of due process, and ideally by civilian courts."
"author. - Mr President, Europe stands right against capital punishment."
"It should be abolished and the EU, particularly the High Representative and the upcoming Polish Presidency, and all the Member States, must firmly demand that the US exclude the death penalty as an option in the first military commission trial for a Guantánamo detainee."
"The case of the Saudi citizen, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, must set the standard."
"Not only would it be a disgrace to the US human rights record to put him on death row, but it could be totally counterproductive in the fight against terrorism."
"President Obama is committed to bringing to an end President Bush's outrageous legacy of running over international law in the name of national security."
"President Obama has yet to deliver on his promise and to close Guantánamo - an area where EU Member States could and should have assisted him more."
"But Congress should also help him and press him to reverse this decision to reinstate the military commission system, as it offers no guarantee of a fair trial, and it must also reverse the decision to keep in indefinite detention detainees against whom no charges are brought."
"The EU must be very clear on this: charge them or release them."
"Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri has been in US custody for nine years and he claims to have been secretly detained by the CIA in a secret detention centre in Poland."
"The upcoming Polish Presidency of the EU has, therefore, a particular responsibility to bring justice to a man who has been subjected to torture, unlawful detention and now faces an unfair trial before a military tribunal."
"It is time to set the record right; both in the United States and in Europe."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to ask a question: where did Mrs Gomes get this information about secret detention centres in Poland?"
"An investigation into this matter is under way in Poland, and so far there is no evidence at all that such centres existed."
"Perhaps they did exist, but there is no proof of this."
"So I am interested as to the source of this information."
"author. - Mr President, this Parliament conducted an investigation into the so-called renditions programme and went to Poland and two other countries, including Romania, where there were allegations of secret prisons."
"We now know that something was found in Lithuania and a parliamentary inquiry has been set up in that country."
"We expect nothing less from the forthcoming Polish Presidency than a proper investigation to establish the truth about these serious allegations."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left took the decision not to associate itself with this resolution on Guantánamo."
"We do not deplore its substance; rather, we find it pretty feeble."
"For my part, I regret the way in which we worked on drafting this resolution."
"How cautious we have been in the way we have talked about condemning the human rights violations perpetrated by a country which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, which still has the death penalty, and for which Guantánamo is an illustration to the world of human rights and international law violations committed in the name of combating terrorism."
"Men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of Cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing US legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them."
"For those men, this is a case of arbitrary detention."
"Worse still, some of them have been tortured, including on European soil: in Romania, in Lithuania and in Poland."
"This must not be spoken of, however."
"We can lecture the entire world on human rights but we are incapable of enforcing them on our own territory."
"We must not even speak of it today, in this resolution!"
"I regret this most sincerely and I do not think that this is how we will promote respect for human rights in the world."
"Yes, it is essential to prevent the death sentence being imposed on Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and on many others, but we could have condemned more strongly the position of the United States in this regard, while regretting, at the very least, the change in attitude on the part of President Obama, particularly with regard to military tribunals."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"author. - (RO) Mr President, I have a question for Mrs Vergiat and I am sorry that I could not ask Mrs Gomes it as well."
"Referring to these allegations against Romania, just like those Mrs Gomes made against Poland, does Mrs Vergiat believe that they help al-Nashiri's case?"
"In what way does referring to these allegations help us identify the means by which we can prevent capital punishment?"
"Or is our resolution not about the death penalty but, somehow, about these allegations?"
"author. - (FR) Mr Preda, we were together at the same session, but we do not share the same conception of those Thursday afternoon sessions."
"I am against double standards being applied to human rights."
"For some countries, we overdo it, we make sweeping statements and, for others, rather arbitrarily, we only take into account specific situations."
"That session, which was held to prepare this resolution, was, from that point of view, a farce, and that is why I left it."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Ms Vergiat if it is true that her hatred is really directed towards the United States of America in its war against terror, rather than the issue of the death penalty?"
"I have never heard her group condemn the execution of people in places like Cuba, or even in China, where it is a common occurrence, unfortunately."
"author. - (FR) Mr Tannock, I refer you to my statements on Cuba."
"I said that I condemn human rights abuses anywhere in the world, in Cuba as elsewhere."
"I do not need any lessons from you in this regard."
"I do not defend Christians against Muslims."
"I defend all human beings who live on this planet, so that they can live free and equal - all of them!"
"Mr President, what I would like to suggest is that we focus specifically on the al-Nashiri case."
"There is the possibility of the death penalty being imposed during the military commission trial on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri."
"I wish to remind you, just as Mr Tannock has also done, that al-Nashiri has been accused of very serious crimes, including involvement in the attacks against a US aircraft carrier and the oil tanker MV Limburg."
"Our opposition in principle to the death penalty must make us ask the US authorities not to impose the death penalty."
"On the other hand, I would like to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has regarded and does regard a strong transatlantic relationship as a priority, in that this is based on the conviction of the existence of a set of common values and on respect for human rights."
"We are all united in this Chamber in utterly rejecting acts of terrorism and in expressing our support for the victims of these attacks."
"However, I regret that a democracy like the United States and dictatorships which Mrs Vergiat is defending explicitly or implicitly are grouped together."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"author. - Mr President, I would ask Mr Preda what he has to say to the fact that, in this Parliament this morning, many colleagues including myself heard Mr Thomas Hammarberg, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, state clearly, in response to a question on this matter, that he indeed had corroboration of the serious suspicions of the existence of secret detention centres in Poland, in Lithuania and in Romania, and that he expected investigations to proceed."
"Let me say that I do not have any animosity towards the US."
"I have only admiration for a US which defends the rule of law and human rights, and for a US that distinguishes itself from terrorists whose aim is indeed to detract from the rule of law and to violate democracy and human rights."
"Allow me to take the opportunity to say that I very much regret that throughout this whole discussion, you have never believed the position of the Romanian authorities."
"I must remind you that Romania is a member of the European Union and I believe that we can at least trust our partners."
"In fact, I want to remind you that the Romanian authorities have always supplied all the information required in these international inquiries."
"All the investigators were given access to the airports at Otopeni, Bucharest and Constanţa, as well as to the base at the Torrejón Satellite Centre."
"Matters were always conducted in an atmosphere of cooperation and there is no way of credibly confirming these actions."
"I do not really understand why, in this game of slinging the same retorts all the time, you never believe the authorities of a partner state."
"Mrs Gomes, Romania is part of the European Union and should not be confused with the countries which we discuss in this Chamber every Thursday."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"author. - (FR) I note that Mr Preda is straying far away from the situation we were discussing to come to the aid of Romania, but that was not my point."
"I regret that he is hurling what I consider to be insults at me."
"I am sorry, Mr Preda, but I have never defended, here in this Chamber, or at any other time in my life, a single dictatorship anywhere in the world."
"I have always denounced all human rights abuses, wherever they are committed."
"I would therefore ask him to kindly withdraw the comments he made about me and thank him in advance."
"Mr President, I had understood that a question was being asked, but one was not put to me."
"What I would like to say is that I still feel it is wrong that we can put in the same boat, on an equal footing, democracies such as the United States or EU Member States, and countries and societies where power is exercised in an authoritarian and totalitarian manner, with ordinary citizens suffering excessive abuses."
"This is what I wanted to say."
"If Mrs Vergiat felt offended by this, I am very sorry about that."
"author. - Mr President, I do not know if we are about to vote on the resolution, but we will eventually do so after the end of this debate."
"I think this issue is a good example of what it means to be consistent with our own principles and values, because this Parliament has spoken out on several occasions against the death penalty, wherever it may occur."
"It has also spoken on what due process of law means; these two fundamental human rights issues are at stake in the case of al-Nashiri."
"Due process of law excludes military commissions."
"We have already criticised this system as it fails, in every respect, to meet international standards on fair trails."
"Moreover, in this case, the Saudi Arabian national faces the death penalty imposed by a military commission, although in 2009, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions specifically asked the US not to conduct capital prosecutions before military commissions."
"The Liberal group in this Parliament remains fully committed to combating terrorism, but without any concessions with regard to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Mr President, Mr Oettinger, the current US Government initially spoke out clearly in favour of closing the detention camp at Guantánamo."
"Unfortunately, the US Government was not able to follow up on its announcement."
"This included closing the military commissions set up there because they do not meet any of the standards for fair court proceedings."
"This makes the fact that there is an imminent death penalty decision and the threat of an execution all the more dramatic."
"Therefore, our resolution calls urgently on all EU institutions and on the Member States to do everything possible to prevent Mr al-Nashiri from being executed."
"We are calling again for the USA to impose a moratorium on the death penalty and to join a worldwide movement in which 96 states have made an irreversible decision to abolish the death penalty."
"The number of states which have retained the death penalty and still make use of it has fallen to 58."
"This is a positive development."
"Mr al-Nashiri was imprisoned in Poland in a secret prison set up by the CIA where he was subjected to intense torture."
"We Europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights."
"The practice of hushing this up, sweeping it under the carpet and allowing those responsible to remain largely immune from prosecution must not continue."
"Today's debate also shows that it is not helpful to talk in superficial terms about anti-Americanism or anti-European sentiments."
"Instead, we must deal with the facts, including the sources which Mrs Gomez referred to."
"In addition, the UN special rapporteur on torture submitted a useful document during the last committee meeting which proves that prisons of this kind were established by the CIA in Poland."
"Mr President, the USA is not the largest democracy in the world, as another speaker said."
"It is the third largest."
"However, I believe that the USA will not be impressed when the second largest democracy in the world after India - the European Union - collapses into internal polemics on this important topic."
"The subject is far too serious and it has rightly been said that our partnership with the USA is based on human rights."
"We are fighting in support of the rule of international law."
"Guantánamo is a zone where national and international law do not apply and, therefore, it goes against the principles of international law."
"We are fighting against military jurisdiction and for the rule of law, which is not compatible with military jurisdiction."
"We are fighting for the right to life and this is not compatible with the death penalty."
"We are fighting for human rights and these human rights are being violated in Guantánamo."
"Therefore, we must make it quite clear to an important ally, like the USA, that we are not prepared to accept this."
"This has been Parliament's position right from the beginning and across all the groups."
"It has also been the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Guantánamo must be closed."
"Even terrorists have human rights, but they must, of course, have a legitimate punishment imposed on them in the interests of their victims."
"However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I have enormous respect for Bernd Posselt."
"The biggest democracy in the world is, of course, India."
"I have never heard the European Union described as a country before."
"Could he confirm whether this is the view of his group now: that the European Union is a country alongside India, Brazil, America, the great democracies of the world, as it were?"
"(DE) Mr President, I am following in the tradition of Winston Churchill, who said: 'We must build a kind of United States of Europe'."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the continued existence of the death penalty in the US and the situation in Guantánamo Bay undermines the United States' legitimacy as our partner in advancing human rights."
"I appreciate President Obama's earlier calls to close Guantánamo very much, but we have yet to see decisive action by the US Government to respond to those calls or take action to reform their system for dealing with detainees, especially in the al-Nashiri case."
"It is impossible to explain to people in Europe or in the world why the death penalty, abolished in Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan and everywhere else in Europe except Belarus, still exists in the USA."
"I believe it will be not too long before we get good news from America on this score."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, no one will disagree that terrorism needs to be prevented and that suspects need to be tried and held accountable, brought to justice in a fair trial, but in the so-called war on terror, we risk compromising precisely those freedoms and values that we claim to defend against destruction through terrorism."
"If we allow the erosion of fundamental rights and principles, we will have allowed the terrorists to win."
"If we act unjustly, we are less credible and even weak."
"The declaration of the end of the war on terror was one of the first landmarks by President Obama."
"However, the failure to close Guantánamo Bay is disappointing and we must also look at ourselves in Europe."
"We are unwilling to take remaining inmates and we must get clarity on the participation in renditions and extrajudicial acts, including torture, on European soil."
"Yes, we must hold ourselves to the highest standards and open these dark pages of recent EU history."
"That means we must openly be able to talk about countries involved."
"Even in this Parliament, that still appears to be difficult."
"The EU and US need to work together, not in violating human rights, but rather to address the most pressing threats in our world."
"We generally share core values, but the difference in our position on the death penalty, which I am proud to say is entirely banned in Europe, makes our joint voice less effective and less credible in the world."
"Let us lead by example in the free world and let us be known for our respect for human rights, indiscriminately of whether we are dealing with friends or enemies."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank all those colleagues who have reminded me that thinking on human rights can only be based on a non-discriminatory treatment of all violations of human rights, wherever they happen."
"This also applies whether they happen inside the European Union or outside the European Union."
"I believe that the time has come for Parliament to take a second look at the possible involvement of the EU Member States in these renditions and secret detention centres."
"I do not think that anyone should be afraid to face the truth and certainly Parliament could, with a new report on this issue, bring some daylight to the issue and also do away with unjustified claims and suspicions."
"As was mentioned this morning, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, whom I very much admire, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, explained to us that this is not a closed story, that it is still going on, and that he would very much wish for Parliament to cooperate with the Council of Europe on this important issue."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, the hypocrisy of the imperialist powers and their double-speak about human rights is demonstrated most graphically behind the wire in Guantánamo Bay."
"The WikiLeaks files have now given an even clearer picture of the grossest abuses of human rights that have taken place there - the widespread use of waterboarding, other forms of brutal torture to extract confessions and information - and they also revealed that hundreds of people were held in Guantánamo with no real evidence against them."
"Yet Barrack Obama has not only ditched his promise to shut that horrific prison but has now approved the resumption of military trials for detainees."
"This hell-hole must be shut down immediately with all of the current detainees having access to fair trial before a civilian court, all of the secret CIA torture prisons in Europe must be shut down, the use of Shannon airport in Ireland for military and rendition flights by the CIA must be ended, and the barbaric death penalty must be brought to an end."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Murphy whether he can also very quickly describe how political prisoners are tortured in Cuba."
"Mr President, similar to Mrs Vergiat, I do not support torture."
"I do not support abuses of human rights anywhere."
"Here, I think we are talking about Guantánamo Bay."
"I think we are talking about secret prisons."
"I think we are talking about gross abuses of human rights and I think they are taking place in the biggest imperialist power in the world - the United States - and they should be condemned here."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, Guantánamo is important, but let us put it in perspective."
"The total number of detainees at Guantánamo since it was opened is 775."
"If you look around this Hemicycle now, there would be room here for all the 775 people that have ever been detained at Guantánamo."
"Of course, this Parliament is strongly concerned about individual liberty and the due process of law, and rightly so, but we should recognise that some detainees do present a problem."
"For example, there was a British citizen who, when arrested on the battlefield in Afghanistan carrying weapons and wearing the black turban of the Taliban, gave the explanation that he was in Afghanistan in order to take a computer course."
"Parliament's concern for the absolute probity of the legal process at Guantánamo is impressive."
"However, I put it to the House that the cause of individual liberty under the law in the world would be better served if Parliament took more interest in the operations of the European Arrest Warrant."
"That European Arrest Warrant, by its nature, outflanks and bypasses legal protections from arbitrary arrest, and 500 million people in Europe are subject to it, while there are now just 171 detainees at Guantánamo."
"(IT) Mr President, five days ago, we had news that five presumed authors of the 11 September attacks on the Twin Towers had been formally charged for the second time and that in doing so, the Obama administration had formally opened the way for these people to be tried before military commissions in the prison in the Guantánamo base."
"Although my outrage at, and condemnation of, all terrorist attacks and of fundamentalist terrorism remains absolute, I believe it is necessary to call for the abandonment of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances."
"I say this because we are opposed to every violation of fundamental human rights, always and wherever they occur."
"In fact, we have already condemned the violation of the right of Guillermo Fariñas to come here to Strasbourg to receive the Sakharov Prize."
"We are talking here of the Mr Fariñas to whom members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left did not wish the Sakharov prize to be awarded, saying that the designation had been exploited for political ends."
"(FR) Mr President, here we have a prime example of the way in which the human rights issue is being used by the European Union for its own ends!"
"We refuse to clearly condemn the United States for the criminal attitude it is displaying at Guantánamo."
"We refuse to acknowledge the responsibility of Member States of the European Union for allowing incarceration and torture in the secret prisons of the CIA."
"We refuse to talk about the minors incarcerated and tortured by the United States at Guantánamo despite their being recognised by UNICEF as child soldiers who have been arrested, whereas we would not hesitate to denounce appalling dictatorships and vote for sanctions in other countries."
"When it comes to ourselves and to the United States, human rights appear to be less of a problem."
"We, for our part, ask for universality of human rights."
"We also ask that our attitude be guided solely by the desire to serve the people and, in that context, want the United States to be tried for human rights violations, as well as the Member States of the European Union found guilty of complicity."
"International law must be complied with at all times, and torture and killings in the name of the war against terrorism must be stopped."
"Last but not least - it is worth repeating - the base at Guantánamo must be closed, and Cuba must regain control of its entire territory."
"Mr President, just as the right to life has a very special place among human rights, the death penalty has no place in democratic societies."
"Today, Europe is the only region in the world where the death penalty has been abolished, with the sad exception of Belarus."
"I would like to emphasise that the European Union remains strongly committed to the abolition of the death penalty everywhere."
"There is no doubt that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable to the European Union, as is our mutual cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"Still, I would like to take this opportunity to support the call on the United States authorities not to seek the death penalty in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri."
"In conclusion, I would like to join all colleagues who urge countries that retain capital punishment to follow the European model, outlaw the death penalty and make abolition a universally accepted value."
"All executions, wherever they take place, should be condemned."
"Mr President, I agree with my colleagues who are saying that, when we make such a serious accusation against a country, we have to be sure that we have all the necessary information."
"I do not think it is about double standards: it is about honesty and being professionally informed."
"Regarding our subject, the USA is responsible for detainees' rights and has the moral obligation to abolish capital punishment."
"As transatlantic relations are primarily based on a set of common values, I hope that the American authorities will be more receptive to the EU's commitment to dropping the death penalty worldwide."
"(RO) On a different note, I would like to reply to Mr Preda."
"The fact that we have this stance supporting the abolition of the death penalty does not mean that we undervalue the strategic partnership which we have with the United States and which we want for both the European Union and our countries."
"Relations with the United States are a priority not only for your group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), but also for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and will be from now on as well."
"Mr President, I wish to stress the case of Abd al-Nashiri."
"He is not only emblematic because of Guantánamo and the death penalty, but also because he is one of the only two named victims of secret detentions in Europe."
"He has actually been granted victim status in the Polish judicial investigation, together with Abu Zubaydah, and given some concrete hope that the accountability process can move forward in Europe."
"I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final resolution includes a clear call for full effective investigation into the European Union Member States' complicity and their renditions and secret detention programmes."
"As Amnesty suggested, however, it is vital to link these with the TDIP report and with the follow-up that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has agreed to take up in a new own-initiative report."
"Work in the European Parliament on the accountability front is absolutely key to keep these issues on the EU agenda."
"(PT) Mr President, we have here yet another sorry example of the double standards that are so often evident in this House."
"What is at issue in this debate is the violation of human rights on the part of the United States authorities, arbitrary and illegal detentions, denial of the right to a fair trial, the practice of torture and capital punishment."
"Some of these violations were committed with the proven complicity of Member States of the European Union, which placed their territories at the disposal of the CIA."
"Deplorably enough, however, in the joint motion for a resolution, we do not find a single word of condemnation of the United States authorities or of the European countries that were complicit with them in this activity."
"Such words are never in short supply when it comes to condemning certain other countries!"
"In this case, demands have been softened into requests and the preferred approach is to emphasise, in the first point of the resolution, the close transatlantic relationship based on shared values and respect for human rights."
"You can see what this respect amounts to."
"It is lamentable, but very revealing."
"Mr President, allow me to conclude by saying that, rather than to appeal for the Guantánamo base to be closed, it would be more to the point to call for the restoration of Cuba's sovereignty over this part of her territory, which is illegally occupied by the United States."
"(FI) Mr President, we are certainly all unanimous on one thing: the EU must continue to cooperate closely in order to eradicate international terrorism."
"We must, however, make it much clearer that the war against terrorism cannot be waged at the expense of human rights and other basic values."
"The EU has opposed torture and the death penalty for a long time, and this also holds true in the case of al-Nashiri."
"Two important principles must be borne in mind: an unconditional 'no' to the death penalty, and the fact that the war against terrorism must also be a war against the causes of terrorism."
"As you know, our transatlantic relations are based on values that we have shared for a long time, such as universal human rights and the right to a fair trial."
"That is why the United States of America must examine its military courts, shut down Guantánamo, and refrain from torture in all cases."
"(PL) Mr President, many fellow Members have spoken of evidence of the existence of detention centres in Poland and Romania and evidence of the use of torture."
"I would like to make an earnest appeal for this evidence to be given to the Polish prosecution service, because an investigation into this matter is under way in Poland."
"The service is independent, and is also independent of the government, and the investigation is being monitored by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights."
"Lawyers acting for two Guantánamo prisoners are involved in the investigation, so if any evidence does exist, it should be placed in the hands of the Polish prosecution service so that it can be examined."
"In the previous parliamentary term, there was a parliamentary committee which investigated this matter."
"One of the members of that committee says about this in Poland today that there is evidence, in the form of a document signed by a former socialist prime minister of Poland, and which regulated the question of a detention centre."
"Asked whether he had seen this document, he said that he had not seen it, but had heard of it."
"So I hope those people who do have evidence and documents will hand them over, and not just talk about them."
"(FI) Mr President, it has to be said that this debate and the political squabbling that goes on between us have not entirely served the purpose of this resolution in the best possible way or shown that in this House, and unanimously across the EU generally, we are keen to defend each person's right to an impartial trial and, moreover, that we are opposed to the death penalty."
"We are categorically opposed to the death penalty, regardless of what crimes the accused may be guilty of."
"As has been made clear in many speeches here, the charges against al-Nashiri are very serious."
"He is accused of acts of terrorism in which many dozens of people have been killed."
"Consequently, it is by means of this resolution that we want to say that we indeed do not accept what he has done."
"We do not support terrorism, but we want to defend the principle where each person has the right to an impartial trial, and we are pleading in favour of the abolition of the death penalty."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union is working closely together with the United States of America in the war against terror."
"Nevertheless, we attach a great deal of importance to protecting human rights as part of the process of combating terrorism."
"In June of last year, we - the EU and the USA - drew up a joint declaration on combating terrorism which states that the war on terror must be in accord with the fundamental values and the principle of the rule of law."
"The agreement specifies that all court proceedings against terrorist suspects must take place within a proper legal framework which ensures that appropriate procedural law will be followed and guarantees a fair trial which, as far as possible, is accessible to the public and efficiently run."
"The European Union has been calling for the closure of the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay for many years."
"We believe that a long imprisonment without trial is not compatible with international law."
"The EU therefore welcomed the fact that, more than two years ago, President Obama announced and organised the closure of the camp within one year."
"We have agreed a joint framework with the USA which forms the basis for the release and the admission into the EU Member States of some of the former prisoners."
"We are still prepared to work closely with the United States on further measures to close the detention camp."
"Despite the decree issued by the President in March of this year in which he officially authorised a longer stay in Guantánamo for some prisoners, the Union hopes - no, in fact, expects - the government of the United States to continue to discuss this subject in Congress and to work towards closing the detention camp as quickly as possible."
"The European Union and the Member States resolutely oppose the death penalty under all circumstances."
"We stand up for this viewpoint in the context of our relationships with all the countries of the world."
"In accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, we are exerting strong pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty at a national level, and at the level of the US federal states, and we are calling for a pardon in individual cases."
"We are therefore concerned about those prisoners who could be facing the death penalty."
"We assume that the US authorities have not yet decided whether Muhammed al-Nashiri and the five people accused of complicity in the terrorist attacks 10 years ago can be sentenced to death by the court."
"I can assure you that the European Union is monitoring the proceedings carefully and will regularly raise its concerns with regard to the death penalty and the fairness of the trial with the US authorities in an appropriate manner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Saudi citizen Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri was arrested in 2002 by the United States and transferred to the Guantánamo base in 2006, accused of war crimes and terrorism."
"The US Attorney General called for the death penalty."
"Indeed, the US authorities will decide by 30 June 2011 whether to support this punishment or not before a military commission which is due to issue a verdict."
"Terrorism must be condemned and those guilty of this crime must be punished without exception."
"However, all defendants must enjoy the right to a fair trial."
"The death penalty does not have a place in a country that defends human dignity, which is at the core of human rights."
"I share the sentiments of those calling for the Commission and Council to urge the US authorities to abolish capital punishment and ensure that this Saudi citizen receives a fair trial."
"in writing. - The United States Department of Defence and its agencies have bluntly disregarded international law, in particular, the Geneva Conventions, with regard to the Guantánamo Bay detention camp."
"It is unacceptable that the United States of America - considered a torchbearer of human rights and democracy - has engaged in ill-treatment and torture of the detainees of the camp."
"The European Union must insist that the US closes the camp immediately and conducts an independent and impartial investigation of the alleged violations of human rights that have taken place in the camp."
"The death penalty should not be exercised by any democratic country; therefore, we call on the US authorities not to implement it in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri or any of the other cases."
"The European Union and its Member States ought to persuade the United States to set a moratorium on the death penalty."
"In the interests of the credibility of the European Union, we must, at all costs, avoid setting double standards on matters of principle such as this."
"3."
"Ukraine: the cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for resolution on Ukraine: the cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I want to state that the development of democracy in Ukraine is a priority for us on which we cannot compromise. No doubt should be cast on the Ukrainian people's achievements either by external or internal factors."
"The current government is attempting, by means of a series of initiatives, to improve both the legislative foundation and the effectiveness of the battle against corruption."
"This is why it must receive encouragement."
"Removing the Ukrainian elite's sense of impunity may provide an opportunity for the beneficial reforms which will bring the country closer to the European Union and offer its citizens prospects for the future."
"However, we currently risk being accused of protecting the leading figures from the previous government with a European political 'screen', including former Prime Minister Tymoshenko personally."
"If we basically expect the Ukrainian Government not to interfere in the work of the independent court and prosecutor's office, what right does the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have to call today for the European Parliament itself to get involved in such political interference?"
"I cannot accept that we should pardon all the decisions made by the previous government in Ukraine."
"This is precisely the sense of the text being tabled, which calls, in practical terms, for the individual abuses of power to be concealed behind collective guilt."
"A more balanced approach has allowed us to have a joint motion for a resolution today which will be constructive and targeted at the opportunities for closer cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, while judicial reform is carried out in the country and the anti-corruption measures implemented."
"However, it has been based on an ideological, confrontational approach."
"I call for the so-called 'motion for a joint resolution' to be rejected and for us to rally support for the proposal from the S&D Group."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I would simply like to ask my fellow Member what the continuous declarations concerning the universality of human rights mean when, in the case of Ukraine, the issue suddenly only concerns internal affairs."
"Saying that no one should intervene in the internal affairs of a country is the old Soviet argument."
"In cases which concern human rights, we will always intervene, in particular with regard to a partner as important as Ukraine."
"Mr President, I want to say that we are not talking about interference in Ukraine's internal affairs, but about non-interference in the operation of the independent court and prosecutor's office in Ukraine."
"I think that there is a clear difference."
"We do not want political interference, either from the government in Ukraine or from the European Parliament."
"However, this is exactly what we are doing with the texts which have been tabled in the so-called 'joint motion for a resolution'."
"If we are talking about universality - I do not know how many minutes I have, Mr President - but if we look around, there are European Union Member States where we can see very similar cases."
"I will believe you, Mr Posselt, that you adhere to the principles and want us to enforce human rights everywhere - both in the European Union and Ukraine - if you table such a resolution for Bulgaria as well where prime ministers and former ministers are being investigated on absurd charges."
"author. - (CS) Mr President, there are moments when I go beyond mere amazement."
"One such moment for me came with the opportunity to read through the motion for a resolution on Ukraine."
"Until then, I had no idea that the ministers and prime ministers of some countries enjoyed special lifetime immunity."
"It is unquestionably remarkable that the European Parliament, on the one hand, demands consistent action against corruption but, on the other hand, when former government member Mr Danilishin faces charges, he is granted political asylum, and in the Czech Republic - my own country - at that, without any preliminary investigation of the case."
"Incidentally, Mr Danilishin has never been a member of any political party, so the charge brought against him is entirely economic in nature."
"Let us seek consistent sanctions for corrupt behaviour both inside and outside the European Union."
"That is entirely proper, but we should read through the constitution of the country concerned, and try to establish the facts."
"Only when corruption has genuinely been eradicated in European countries should we try reverting to the imperious recommendations granted to various countries in the resolutions adopted, unfortunately, by us."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left agrees with the general parts of the resolution, but has serious doubts over the points specifically mentioned, and therefore will not support the resolution."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, unfortunately, we have grounds for expressing strong criticism of the political situation in Ukraine and, in particular, of the means used to curtail the constitutional rights of opposition politicians."
"The opposition leader, Mrs Tymoshenko, and other prominent people have had their human rights violated and have been prevented from doing their political work by means of politically motivated criminal proceedings and antiquated procedural law."
"Anyone who turns the constitutional right of an accused person to access their files into the exact opposite, in other words, into a compulsion to access the files, and anyone who does this, as in the case of Mr Lutsenko, by means of imprisonment and, in the case of Mrs Tymoshenko, by a total of 44 summonses so far, clearly demonstrates what sort of person he is and the fact that he is abusing the judicial system in the old-fashioned way for the purposes of political disputes."
"President Yanukovych and his authorities must bring an end to this persecution."
"He is personally responsible for the well-being of Mrs Tymoshenko, Mr Lutsenko and their colleagues and supporters."
"Mr Yanukovych, your behaviour in these cases is the litmus test of your credibility and your determination to introduce European values into Ukraine."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PL) Mr President, I agree with the fellow Member on many issues."
"We all know how important it was for the consolidation of democracy and human rights for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to be able to achieve accession to the Union, and before that to have the perspective of accession."
"I would like to ask Mr Gahler if he is willing to declare that he is in favour of giving such a political perspective to Ukrainian society and to politicians of all persuasions and that the road to the European Union is open to them, and if he will endorse statements of this kind in the European Parliament."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, the current behaviour of the government of Ukraine will definitely not make the country's move into Europe any easier."
"author. - Mr President, we are not here today to judge the actual innocence or guilt of Yulia Tymoshenko."
"It has gone well beyond that point because the Ukrainian authorities have overlooked the correct legal procedures and taken measures that violate the rule of law."
"We protest against the elimination of political opponents in Ukraine with the help of the judicial system."
"Defendants must be granted their legal rights, as enshrined in law, and the measures taken against them must be proportionate to the nature and gravity of the crimes that they have been accused of."
"The purpose of this resolution is to draw the attention of the Ukrainian authorities to some apparent breaches of the rule of law which have distanced Ukraine from European values, and which, if they become commonplace, would curtail their country's prospects of future European integration."
"author. - Mr President, the reason we, the Greens, support this joint resolution is that we consider the fight against corruption a fundamental factor in the establishment and consolidation of the rule of law in Ukraine, with a view precisely to deepening its relations with the European Union and enhancing its integration into EU policies."
"We stress, therefore, that those efforts require fair, impartial and independent legal proceedings."
"That is why we note with concern the widespread opinion that the recent case brought against Mrs Tymoshenko and some members of the government are politically motivated, and warn against a possible use of penal law as a tool to achieve political ends."
"That is also why we call on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that judicial measures are not used selectively and that investigations, prosecutions and trials are held in maximum transparency."
"Finally, that is also the reason why we call on the Ukrainian authorities to avoid any perception of judicial measures being used selectively and insist that the maximum transparency of investigations, persecutions and trials be guaranteed; we also call on the Commission to assist in the reform of the judiciary in Ukraine by making use of EU capacity-building programmes and to consider creating a high-level EU advisory group for Ukraine to assist the country in its efforts to align itself with EU legislation, including on the judiciary."
"Mr President, the restrictive measures taken against Yulia Tymoshenko mark the continuation by the current government of a series of actions targeted against members of the former government, with the aim of intimidating and weakening the opposition."
"We are deeply concerned by the use of the justice system for political ends through selective actions aimed solely at members of the opposition."
"They jeopardise the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy in Ukraine."
"We call on the authorities in Kiev to ensure that the justice system operates on an impartial, independent and transparent basis by giving the defendants a fair trial."
"At the same time, we call on them to abide by the rules of a democratic state and to ensure respect for human rights, which are obligations they assumed as part of the Eastern Partnership."
"We must stress that respect for these principles is vital to promoting cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, including with a view to signing the Association Agreement."
"Mr President, one of the priorities of the forthcoming Polish Presidency is to strengthen the Eastern Partnership."
"Ukraine, as Poland's nearest neighbour, is one of the most important partners and has the opportunity to gain more than the other partners from this situation."
"While I share the opinion about the necessity of bringing Ukraine closer to the Union, I also think that this must involve the adoption by Ukraine of European standards in the field of the rule of law and transparency in public life."
"It is with great concern that I have followed the corruption scandals in Ukraine and the trials of politicians who are being accused in a way which is sometimes ludicrous."
"The Union is being very careful in the way it comments on events in Ukraine."
"Furthermore, the statement of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Yulia Tymoshenko was exceptionally cautious."
"However, I think that as part of future cooperation between the Union and Ukraine, instruments should be created which, in the longer term, would contribute to a strengthening of the rule of law in Ukraine."
"I have in mind, here, the idea of creating, for example, an advisory group to help bring Ukrainian law closer to European standards, and assistance in various areas of law, including the training of judges, for example."
"I think Ukraine's European aspirations, which, on the one hand, are hedged around with conditions, should, on the other, show a willingness to help in this."
"I hope the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union will adopt such a stance."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy."
"Therefore, we signal our concern to a partner, an ally, and a friend."
"As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe's political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution."
"Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government of Ukraine, who had long been the rivals of President Yanukovych, should not be regarded as collectively, or by association, guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice."
"First and foremost, they are all citizens of a democratic state."
"By no means are we offering a defence speech here."
"Instead, we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, six years on from the Orange Revolution, Ukrainian politics remain characterised by rivalry and tension."
"Former Prime Minister Tymoshenko and some members of the former government that she led are now being pursued through the courts for criminal acts allegedly committed whilst in office."
"These charges to me have a smell of being politically motivated."
"I fear that President Yanukovych is trying to neutralise the only Ukrainian political figure with enough gravitas, courage and popularity to challenge his authority."
"We should not forget that the Orange Revolution was a direct response to Yanukovych's attempt to steal, by fraud, in 2004 the Presidential election."
"He was never prosecuted for that crime."
"Mrs Tymoshenko has substantial popular support in western Ukraine and carries the hopes of millions of her compatriots with her."
"It is very curious that the latest charges relating to fraud against the medicines budget were not levelled against Zinovii Mytnyk, the Deputy Minister for Heath at the time, who signed off on the deal, because he has now re-emerged, curiously, as the new Health Minister in Yanukovych's Government."
"If Yanukovych wants to reduce Mrs Tymoshenko's political potency, he should seek to do so in an open and democratic battle of ideas, not through the political manipulation of the justice system."
"And my question to Mr Vigenin, as the Socialist Group has links to Yanukovych's Party of the Regions, is: do you have confidence in the political impartiality of the General Prosecutor's Office in Ukraine?"
"Mr Vigenin, could you answer that?"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (SK) Mr President, Ukraine's political scene is characterised by a gubernatorial style of leadership, deeply rooted in the former Soviet era."
"Even those who led the Orange Revolution, President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Tymoshenko, exhibited some peculiar political behaviour."
"Indeed, it is an open secret in Ukraine and abroad that the real cause of the gas crisis that descended on us in early 2009 was a rift between the family clans of Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko, as they fought to control the profits from the transport of gas."
"I agree that exploiting the baseless criminalisation of political opponents in order to repress opposition forces is unacceptable, but I find it highly presumptuous to claim that none of Tymoshenko's team put a foot wrong during their chaotic period in government."
"Tymoshenko's group lost the elections precisely because ordinary people had had enough of widespread corruption and the theft of public property by certain public officials."
"Therefore, if we really want to help Ukraine to develop an open, democratic society, we should concentrate on systemic recommendations and not tell them that those senior officials who may be endearing to some of you or with whom you may be friends should be treated any differently from other criminal suspects."
"Indeed, here in the European Union, we also say that all are equal, and that includes equality before the law."
"(CS) Mr President, the methods used to conduct the investigation into alleged violations of the law by Mrs Tymoshenko and other opposition politicians have completely discredited the Ukrainian judiciary, the police, and the current government."
"Such persecutory practices belonged to the arsenal of totalitarian communist regimes in the last century, and those EU citizens who lived under those regimes are particularly sensitive to this."
"We see this as yet another abuse of public power to discredit political opponents, which is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society."
"I draw attention to the fact that this fundamentally challenges the independence of the Ukrainian judiciary in the eyes of the world."
"Under these circumstances, I appeal to EU Member States to join the Czech Republic in standing ready to grant political asylum to persecuted Ukrainian opposition politicians and to consider sanctions against Ukraine for violations of international law, if the situation in Ukraine does not change."
"(PL) Mr President, we are wondering what the essence is of what we are talking about because the facts are, after all, generally known, and we are coming down in favour of those who today are having problems, and of those who are finding themselves at the wrong end of the abuse of authority."
"However, we must learn the lessons of this situation, and lessons must be learned, above all, by the authorities in Ukraine."
"A condition for building a normal democratic system in Ukraine is respect for the rights of the opposition, and we must say this very clearly from here, today."
"However, in this Chamber, we must also say something very clearly to ourselves."
"This is the experience of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and also East Germany."
"There can be no real modernisation in this part of Europe if we cannot say that for Ukrainians, and not for this or that authority, there is a place in Europe."
"Perhaps not today, perhaps not in several years, but that perspective does exist."
"Without talking clearly about that perspective - and I am talking to all friends from every part of Europe - we are, in fact, going to be working together to maintain badly functioning democratic systems in the East."
"Do not be under any illusions about this."
"It is a very simple matter."
"So, as well as holding this debate, we also have something else to do - to say clearly: the door is open, do not worry."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to start with the words of Mr Donskis, who called the Ukrainians our friends and allies."
"This is indeed the case, and this is how we should treat our friends in Kiev."
"I would like to ask everyone a question."
"I have similar comments and I share the quandary of most of you who have spoken, today."
"I, too, am not satisfied by the way human rights are being observed and by how democracy is functioning in Kiev, but what have you done - what has this House done, and what have all those who have today, with such high principles, condemned the situation with Mrs Tymoshenko - what have you done to send a clear signal to Kiev and other cities of Ukraine that we are their friends and allies, that we are waiting for them, and that this House should one day be enlarged by the presence of Ukrainian Members?"
"I ask this because respect for human rights and respect for democracy in Ukraine are, to a large extent, dependent on us."
"I must ask you to understand this."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I would simply like to ask my fellow Member whether he is not aware that we have adopted a resolution in Parliament with a large majority - I myself voted in favour of this resolution - in which we clearly underlined the European perspective of Ukraine."
"We have done this not once, but many times."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Posselt, firstly, I do know, and secondly, thank you for that resolution."
"I am asking, however, if this is all we could have done?"
"Is this really all that can be sent from this Chamber and from the EU institutions to the Ukrainians, who are fighting today about the same things which once happened to the Poles and the Czechs?"
"Finally, how many positive signals of this kind about membership of the European Union have been sent to the Ukrainians from the German Government, for example?"
"Mr President, the road to democracy is often a slow and tortuous one."
"Some countries move quicker than others and we see that with the countries of the former Soviet Union, who are now our valid colleagues here in the European Parliament."
"Others countries move somewhat slower - maybe Ukraine is an example of that."
"Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that it has made progress but must go further."
"In particular, to establish true democracy, it needs, first of all, to promote civil society, secondly, end state control, particularly over NGOs, thirdly, have a truly independent judiciary, and fourthly, have a free and strong opposition."
"You cannot have proper democracy without having a free, strong and vibrant opposition."
"We in the European Union must use every means to encourage Ukraine to go the full circle and establish true democracy."
"It has made progress, but it needs to go a bit further."
"(FI) Mr President, the charges that have been brought against Tymoshenko are, as she herself has said, purely political in nature."
"We also have to remind ourselves that several other former members of her Cabinet are also accused or suspected of corruption."
"As I believe Mrs Ojuland mentioned here earlier, we are not a court."
"We are not here to decide whether these people are guilty or innocent."
"Instead, we want to remind everyone of how important it is that these hearings cannot be selective in any sense and that the legal proceedings must be open and must be non-discriminatory."
"May I say that I wish to thank Lady Ashton for expressing her concern back in May regarding the charges brought against the Ukrainian opposition leaders, and their possible political ends."
"We have to continue along this path and ensure that these hearings in Ukraine do not actually become selective or anti-opposition in nature."
"(IT) Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy, a friendly country, a partner of this European Union."
"However, Ukraine must adopt European standards also in the administration of judicial power, which is characterised by politicised trials in which the accused do not enjoy all the rights and means necessary to face a trial that, in some cases, is a purely political trial."
"This represents a criminalisation of political opponents of the government in office, aimed solely at eliminating and silencing the opposition."
"Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister, and her ministers are being attacked by means of show trials, rather than by a political confrontation which, although heated, would be serious and transparent."
"The Ukrainian Government must respect the opposition, without brandishing the weapon of judicial power, and respect the rules of a democratic state and human rights, as subscribed to in the Eastern Partnership agreements."
"(FI) Mr President, the former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has had to answer several corruption charges this spring, and a ban on travel in February prevented her from coming to meet us in Brussels."
"If Tymoshenko is eventually found guilty, she faces a sentence of up to ten years in prison."
"The background and context, however, beg awkward questions and arouse concern regarding the partly politically motivated nature of the charges."
"Our resolution rightfully raises the issue of the charges against the leaders of the political opposition, charges that look ever more selective in nature, and insists on a guarantee of the transparency of the investigations and of the judicial process."
"The fight against corruption and the affirmation of the rule of law are not just preconditions for deepening EU-Ukraine relations: they are also crucial for reinforcing Ukraine's democratic development."
"Ukraine's new political leaders must also show a sense of responsibility and start implementing the reforms that have remained half-finished since the Orange Revolution."
"(RO) Mr President, the motion for a resolution relating to the case of the members of the former Ukrainian Government is needed to ensure respect for the basic principles of the European Union, starting with respect for human rights."
"It is not Ukraine's justice system which is the biggest concern, but the possible interference of politics in the administration of justice."
"The European Union, as a community of law and values, must support the members of the former Ukrainian Government to ensure respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"I would like to highlight the need to continue and step up the reforms being carried out in Ukraine and to align its legislation with the EU's provisions and obligations as key elements aimed at bringing it closer to the European Union."
"The success of the reform process taken on by Ukraine will depend on the promotion of, and respect for, democratic principles, the rule of law and transparency."
"With regard to the charges made against Yulia Tymoshenko and the members of the former government, an abuse of power cannot be used to take action against an accusation of an abuse of power."
"Democracy must make progress in Ukraine and we can support this process."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is following developments in Ukraine with regard to the former members of the government of Ukraine, Mrs Tymoshenko, Mr Lutsenko and others very closely, as Parliament and the parliamentary groups are also doing."
"Since the beginning of the year, we have been making clear our concerns about the possible political motivation that lies behind these cases."
"The EU has a delegation in the country and is monitoring developments carefully."
"The progress report on Ukraine which we published a few days ago gives a comprehensive picture of the situation in the country last year."
"Our evaluation of the situation, which has not changed, shows the need for comprehensive reform of the justice system and for measures to combat corruption."
"The report emphasises that respect for the rule of law in criminal investigations and criminal prosecutions and fair, impartial and independent court proceedings must be guaranteed, in order to ensure that criminal law is not abused for political purposes."
"In cases involving former members of the government, a clear distinction must be made between criminal and political responsibility."
"The concerns about the excessive use of detention and custody measures and of travel restrictions also give the impression of an arbitrary approach to justice."
"At the same time, a large part of Ukrainian civil society, experts throughout the world and foreign businesspeople working in Ukraine are firmly convinced that the courts in Ukraine are being subjected to strong pressure from different sides."
"We are hoping that future amendments to the law on the reform of the judicial system will take into consideration the statement by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and sweep away these concerns."
"I would like to emphasise that we attach great importance to safeguarding the rule of law in Ukraine, which is a country that we want to enter into a closer contractual relationship with on the basis of association and economic integration."
"A smoothly functioning, independent and transparent justice system is essential in order for this to happen."
"We do not want to take sides in any individual cases, but we expect Ukraine to bring about fundamental changes in its system in order to guarantee impartial, fair and transparent court proceedings."
"We are convinced that the stability of Ukraine and the confidence of its citizens in the country's public bodies will depend on the progress made in this area."
"The speed and the scope of our integration with Ukraine, and vice versa, will depend on whether Ukraine can fully guarantee its respect for human rights, the principles of democracy and the principles of the rule of law."
"These principles must not be called into question in any way."
"This conclusion is in line with the results of the review of the European neighbourhood policy."
"The meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council which is taking place in the course of the next few weeks will give us the opportunity to discuss numerous issues that are important for our relationship and to send clear signals to Ukraine which are the same as those that you are sending about the importance of reform in this area."
"We are pleased about Ukraine's determination to conclude the negotiations on an association agreement before the end of this year."
"So far, so good."
"However, Ukraine must implement the necessary far-reaching reforms, in particular, of the judicial system, the electoral system and the constitution, in order to be able to enjoy the opportunities which this agreement can offer with regard to association and economic integration with the EU."
"In addition, the country must make more decisive efforts to combat corruption."
"Ukraine is not alone in this respect, but it must demonstrate its unconditional determination to introduce more comprehensive and more inclusive reforms if it wants to move closer to the EU."
"We will continue to provide Ukraine with significant support in its efforts to bring about internal reforms."
"Finally, I would like to say that we will make clear our absolute respect for proper court proceedings, without passing comment."
"We are relying on being able to continue our open and transparent dialogue in Kiev and in Brussels about internal reforms in Ukraine and about the country's closer integration with the EU, both with the Ukrainian authorities and with the opposition."
"Thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
", in writing. - I was surprised by the wish of some political forces in the European Parliament to support former leaders of Ukraine both morally and politically."
"It is known that the European People's Party has a cooperation agreement with the bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko."
"It would be interesting to know whether there is in the agreement a point on legal protection and provision of lawyer services?"
"Today's resolution looks more like an appeal but not like a European Parliament document."
"I consider it necessary to declare that nobody is eligible to interfere in judicial proceedings and prosecution activities."
"By evaluating the work of the prosecutor in advance, before the end of the investigation, we prevent justice from being implemented."
"The European Parliament is not a lawyer's office."
"In such cases, we should wait until the investigation comes to an end."
"We should recommend to the accused to cooperate with investigating bodies."
"We do not have any right to put pressure on the judicial system of Ukraine since it can be qualified as interference in internal affairs."
"I am categorically against resolution P7_TA-PROV(2011)0272 because I consider it to be putting rough pressure on the government of Ukraine."
"The priorities of the Ukrainian Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe are, inter alia, to prevent violations of human rights and to uphold the principles of the rule of law."
"Ukraine has also undertaken to build democracy at local level and to strengthen local self-government."
"At the same time, the Helsinki Committee is warning that Ukraine is breaching the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The preventative detentions and the ban on leaving the country which has been imposed on the most important members of the opposition and former members of the government cast doubt on the objectivity of the Ukrainian prosecution service."
"In the opinion of the European Parliament, there is a lack of transparency in the investigation, and the procedural methods adopted are out of proportion."
"The European Parliament should ask the Ukrainian Prosecutor General to lift this ban."
"The real problem, however, lies in the continued lack of democratic reform in Ukraine."
"During the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in March 2011, the Ukrainian representatives explained that more time is needed to shake off the Communist past."
"I think, too, that achieving democracy is not easy, but requires the will to introduce change and take forceful steps."
"Enough time has already passed since the fall of the USSR, and other post-Communist countries have made significant progress."
"To create a pluralistic system of the rule of law, Ukraine must start by efficiently making changes to its electoral law and criminal legislation."
"The European Union must, however, insist that the demands it is making are met, chiefly because it is itself offering a great deal in the Eastern Partnership and Neighbourhood Policy."

"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has asked for the floor."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we discussed Russia in our last part-session."
"At the time, we sent messages to the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council telling them to discuss the Russian elections."
"We have now been informed that one party in Russia has been denied registration."
"On the other hand, the OSCE has informed us that they have been permitted to send observers to oversee the elections."
"We would like to receive a statement on the state of affairs in Russia as soon as possible."
"We also want to have a debate on this."
"I think that would be appropriate."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse this motion."
"However, it is up to the Conference of Presidents, as a sign of political will, to allow us also to have a brief statement and a debate on this matter in the July part-session, when the High Representative will also be here."
"We are not having a debate now."
"We take note of this request and will pass it on to the relevant bodies."
"We now move on to the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 9 June 2011 pursuant to Rules 137 and 138 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Having consulted with the political groups, I would like to submit to the House the following proposed amendments to the final version of the draft agenda:"
"Thursday 23 June 2011"
"1."
"The vote on the report by Mr Kastler on the European Year for Active Ageing (2012) is postponed to the July part-session."
"2."
"The report by Mr Tatarella on tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme will be included directly in the vote."
"The deadline for tabling amendments is at 16:00 today."
"Are there any comments?"
"There are no comments, so these amendments are accepted."
"In addition, the following changes have been requested:"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that today, on Wednesday 22 June 2011, the debate on economic governance take place immediately after the debate on preparations for the European Council meeting and before the Dess report on the common agricultural policy."
"(The amendment was rejected)"
"We shall now move on to the order of business for Thursday."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has asked to postpone to a later part-session the vote on the reports included in the joint debate on economic governance (Ferreira, Feio, Ford, Goulard, Wortmann-Kool and Haglund."
"Mr Klute has the floor to present the request."
"Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session."
"Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple."
"The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated."
"As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these."
"The necessary translations were not available, either."
"We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Europe urgently needs a strong foundation for the euro."
"We have been discussing this package for many months and now there is 98% agreement with the Council."
"We would like to have the vote tomorrow so that Parliament can express its views in a vote in plenary."
"Further negotiations with the Council are needed so we can get a final agreement before summer in order to have a strong foundation for the euro."
"Mr President, we are looking at a package that has had last-minute changes made to it by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, which have not yet been translated into the various languages."
"First of all, there is only one version - at least, I have only had access to an English version - which does not give us an exact picture of what happened."
"The second issue is that the facts involved are vitally important and the consequences are very serious for our countries and our peoples, not least bearing in mind the situations that are now being experienced here in the European Union, for instance in Greece and Ireland and, as is being announced, Portugal."
"We therefore think a more careful approach to these issues is required."
"That is why we insist that we need to put off voting on them until July."
"The request is rejected."
"The order of business is thus adopted."
"Preparations for the European Council meeting (24 June 2011) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council meeting of 23-24 June 2011."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, this is the last occasion I have to address this House on behalf of the Council in a plenary debate."
"In January, we promised to run a Parliament-friendly Presidency."
"Aware of the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, we realised that close cooperation with the European Parliament and its members would be essential for the success of any Presidency in the future."
"The European public looks to the EU for results, without bothering too much with distinguishing between Parliament, Commission and Council."
"And they are right in doing so."
"We have a common responsibility and therefore our success or failure is shared."
"The forthcoming European Council marks the end of the Hungarian Presidency."
"Therefore, this debate is a golden opportunity to give an account of what it has achieved on a number of dossiers, in close cooperation with this House."
"Let me start with economic policy."
"The European Council will bring the first European Semester to a conclusion."
"It brings together in one policy cycle the two arms of economic recovery: financial stability that is based on fiscal consolidation, reflected in stability and convergence programmes, and structural reforms for a smart, sustainable, socially-inclusive and job-creating growth."
"Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Commission, Council and Member States in handling national reform programmes and recommendations, the first European Semester has lasted a semester, and not a day longer."
"The European Council will be invited to endorse the country-specific recommendations approved by the Council, which should be reflected by all Member States in their national decisions as regards their budgets and structural reforms."
"Even in the trialogue negotiations, we included a reference to the European semester so that Parliament could be duly informed of these developments."
"Regarding the Euro Plus Pact, most of the Member States participating have presented commitments amounting to more than a hundred separate measures in total."
"Those commitments are a good step towards achieving the objectives of the Pact, which must now be implemented at the national level."
"However, the degree of ambition and precision of these initial commitments is uneven."
"In preparing their next commitments, Member States will ensure a broader scope, a more concrete approach and a higher degree of ambition."
"Allow me now to turn to the six legislative proposals on economic governance, called the 'six-pack' in our common jargon."
"I will not go into detail as it is on the plenary agenda in its own right."
"Let me just remind you that the Hungarian Presidency was given a mandate by the European Council to reach political agreement with Parliament by the end of June."
"After the adoption of a general approach by the Council in March, we got down to business immediately, engaging in intense trialogue negotiations with Parliament and the Commission."
"The three institutions have done immense work."
"The initial position of Parliament carried approximately 2 000 amendments."
"By now, we have managed to reduce the outstanding issues to one single major issue and some technicalities."
"I am convinced that the text we have on the table now is stronger and more suited to preventing future crises."
"We will inform the President of the European Council accordingly, thus reporting back to the body which gave us this mission."
"I have been personally involved in fascinating talks with many members of this House."
"I take this opportunity to thank you all sincerely for this experience."
"As a Parliament-friendly Presidency, we hope that the results which have brought us to the verge of agreement will not be wasted."
"The financial markets, European business and, most importantly, our fellow European citizens, expect us to show responsibility and decide and act against indebtedness - the chief predicament of our economies."
"Finally, we know too that the issue of Greece will be also on the agenda of the European Council."
"Let me now turn to Justice and Home Affairs."
"The European Council will address strategic issues relating to asylum, migration and Schengen; building on the conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 9 June 2011."
"In the light of recent developments, the European Council will discuss ideas and provide more political guidance and cooperation in the Schengen area."
"It will also discuss ideas as regards a possible safeguard mechanism."
"But let me stress that the good functioning of Schengen requires Member States to fully implement the rules and thus enhance mutual trust among themselves."
"It also requires an effective and updated monitoring and evaluation system."
"Let me touch upon the free movement of persons."
"It belongs to a different chapter of the acquis comunautaire than Schengen, yet they are inextricably linked."
"Both belong to the most visible and popular achievements of European integration."
"The Member States are aware of this and fully intend to safeguard them."
"The logic behind Schengen is unchanged: ever more efficient management of the external border is the precondition for travelling without border controls within the Schengen zone."
"As you know, there have been intensive negotiations on the Frontex Amending Regulation."
"We have in Frontex a European tool par excellence which is essential for controlling our external borders."
"The Presidency welcomes the positive result of the most recent trialogue meeting."
"Member States are discussing the results this afternoon and we are optimistic that an agreement can be reached in time for the European Council."
"Regarding the European Asylum policy: recent developments have put this under strain."
"Safe and efficient asylum procedures are required for people in need of protection."
"It is therefore crucial for the Common European Asylum System to be completed by 2012 - a system based on high protection standards combined with fair and effective procedures capable of preventing abuse and allowing for rapid examination of asylum applications in order to ensure its sustainability."
"The European Council will also review the progress on the preparation of the plans for capacity development to manage migration flows and refugee flows."
"The objective must be to address the root causes of irregular migration."
"To that end, partnerships will be developed with Southern Neighbourhood countries."
"As a first step, a wide-ranging structured dialogue on migration, mobility and security will be established with those countries, with the aim of securing tangible benefits for them as well as for the EU."
"Let me now say some words on Croatia."
"Closing the accession negotiations with Croatia was listed among the top priorities of our Presidency."
"As a result of the tremendous efforts made by Croatia, the Commission and the Presidency with the essential support of this House - for which it deserves immense credit - the European Council will call for the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia by the end of June 2011."
"The signing of the Accession Treaty before the end of the year is being envisaged."
"These developments bring a new momentum to the European perspective of the Western Balkans."
"The European Council will return to this matter at its December 2011 meeting."
"In this context, it is expected to welcome the arrest of General Mladić and his transfer to The Hague."
"Serbia has taken a giant step towards EU accession."
"Regarding the Southern Neighbourhood: the European Council is expected to endorse the new approach to relations with the EU neighbours which was agreed at Monday's Foreign Affairs Council."
"Given the serious developments in parts of the Union's southern neighbourhood, the European Council is also expected to adopt a declaration on recent events in the region."
"Among other issues, let me inform you that the European Council is expected to appoint Mario Draghi as the next Governor of the European Central Bank on whom this house takes a vote."
"Last but not least, the European Council is likely to endorse the EU Strategy for the Danube Region and the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies, thus realising two further priorities of the Hungarian Presidency."
"The Danube Strategy is designed to enhance opportunities for an entire region that embraces a diversity of Member States and third countries in the Western Balkans - nations, peoples and communities alike."
"With the EU Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies, we will tackle the plight of the Roma people for the first time at European level and turn it into an opportunity for all of us."
"A special thanks to this House for producing such an excellent report - the Járóka report - and the decision, which was an excellent base for our work in the Council."
"Europe thus will show that, in the words of Prime Minister Orbán, it 'has a heart and not only a brain'."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, the Hungarian Presidency chose 'Strong Europe' as a motto."
"Let me express hope that you will agree with the judgment of President Buzek, who recently said 'after the Hungarian Presidency Europe will be stronger and better'."
"Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, for your cooperation in the last six months."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, this week's European Council has a very substantive agenda."
"Minister Győri has presented the agenda in general, on behalf of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council."
"I wish to thank her, at this juncture, for the commitment shown over the course of these six months."
"Let me focus on some specific points: I have written a letter to the members of the European Council outlining the positions of the Commission on what I believe are the most important items on the agenda, and I would like to share our positions with you."
"At the end I will also make some comments regarding Greece."
"This European Council will take very important steps towards ensuring that the European Union's economic policy-making is both more coherent and more effective."
"Firstly, we have the economic governance package."
"I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue."
"Later this afternoon, Commissioner Rehn, on behalf of the Commission, will express our detailed positions on these extremely important matters."
"Now I expect Parliament and the Member States to come to an agreement, because the adoption of the governance package is fundamental to our comprehensive response to the crisis."
"Agreement on this package is vital."
"It will be extremely difficult to explain to our citizens why we are not able to agree on the fundamental pillars of the response to this crisis when we are trying to respond to challenges of the current magnitude."
"I believe the agreement on this package will strengthen our economic surveillance mechanisms at European level."
"It will make the European Union far better placed to prevent the development of unsustainable public debt and deficits, and the emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances."
"Although prevention is better than cure, we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge."
"Secondly, I expect the Heads of State and Government to endorse the country-specific recommendations that the Commission presented on 7 June."
"This is, as you know, the first time we are carrying out this kind of collective exercise at European level."
"The recommendations are based on an extensive analysis by the Commission of Member States' plans for sustainable growth and job creation, married to sound public finances."
"They are focused, measurable and tailored to each country's most pressing challenges."
"Of course, discussions between the Commission and the Member States on these recommendations have sometimes been very intense, but I am pleased that the overall result has maintained the high level of ambition."
"We cannot reap the benefits of the single market on the one hand and ignore reckless economic policy-making on the other."
"There is no point in signing off on a brand new economic governance package if, the very same week, Member States question the methodology and independent Commission recommendations in the country-specific exercise."
"This new way of policy-making is also a strong appeal for collective responsibility, because the European Union's economic space is so much more than the sum of our different economies."
"Thirdly, the European Council is due to endorse the treaty change needed to allow for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism in 2013, with its capacity to assist - on the basis of strict conditionality - euro area Member States in financial difficulties."
"The ESM, combined with the increase of the effective lending capacity of the EFSF, is a clear demonstration of our commitment to safeguard the stability of the euro area on the basis of sound and sustainable public finances."
"You may remember that, in January when the Commission presented the annual growth survey, a very important topic was the need to reinforce the effective lending capacity of the EFSF."
"At that time we were very much criticised, but now - unanimously - the governments of Europe have decided to increase the effective lending capacity."
"I wonder if it would not have been possible to approve it some months ago."
"The economic governance package, country-specific recommendations and the stability mechanisms: this is how Europe should seriously draw the lessons from the crisis and act upon them."
"The Commission will do its utmost to maintain this level of steadfast resolve in all matters to be discussed."
"To respond to the economic crisis, every sector needs to contribute, and none more so than the financial sector."
"I have promised Parliament that the Commission will bring forward a formal legislative proposal on a financial tax."
"The proposal will have three aims."
"Firstly, to avoid fragmentation of the internal market for financial services, because there are an increasing number of uncoordinated national tax measures being put in place."
"Secondly, this financial tax also aims to create appropriate disincentives for overly-risky or purely speculative transactions."
"Thirdly, to ensure that financial institutions make a fair and substantive contribution to the sharing of the costs of the recent crisis, as well as to address concerns about excessive profits."
"The very high bonuses that are still being paid to bankers - bankers who have sometimes been saved thanks to huge amounts of taxpayers' money - suggest that there are excessive profits in the banking sector and that the banking sector should also contribute to the common public good."
"(Applause)"
"The second major issue for the European Council is migration."
"The issue of migration has come to the fore in recent months, particularly under the pressure of recent events in the southern Mediterranean."
"I spoke to Parliament in May about the Commission's migration package, which sets recent and future policy initiatives in a framework that allows the EU and its Member States to manage asylum, migration and mobility of third-country nationals in a secure environment."
"Migration, let us face it, is a very emotive issue."
"But let me state clearly that the Commission will not accept any attempts to undermine the Schengen principles."
"In fact, I think that we will see exactly the opposite, through a reinforcement of the European approach to migration and free movement."
"The Commission has proposed strengthening the governance of the Schengen area, thereby reinforcing Member States' confidence and trust in the effective management of our external borders."
"This will be done both through strengthening the Frontex border agency and through an evaluation mechanism whereby national border agencies will work jointly on assessing threats."
"We are also exploring the feasibility of a safeguard system which would allow the adoption of decisions at European level to confront possible difficult situations where our common external borders are subject to exceptional pressure or where Member States are failing to comply with their obligations to control their borders."
"Decisions on the best way to handle such situations should be taken at European Union level, avoiding unilateral action by Member States."
"As a last-resort mechanism, and if the critical situation justifies it, these decisions could make provision for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls, but always within a Community framework."
"This does not mean rolling back the abolition of internal borders."
"This is a way of strengthening the European dimension of the system so that individual Member States do not feel pressured into acting unilaterally."
"I will be looking for clear backing for this approach from the European Council, so that detailed Commission proposals can be finalised and have an opportunity to succeed."
"The migration package is completed by proposals for a common, efficient and protective asylum system which guarantees asylum seekers equal treatment across the European Union."
"I am confident that Parliament and the Council will endorse the proposals set out in the Commission's reviewed proposals on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and on refugee status."
"I will call on the European Council to lend its support to the completion of the entirety of the asylum package as quickly as possible within the agreed deadline."
"The European Council has also discussed the situation in our neighbourhood, in particular the implementation of the Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean."
"This partnership is extremely important to our Arab partners, who are looking to the European Union to support the democratic transitions in the southern Mediterranean."
"We must not let them down."
"Another item on the upcoming European Council agenda is the Commission's recommendation that Croatia become the 28th Member State of the European Union, hopefully by 1 July 2013."
"There is still substantial work to be done, but I hope that at the end of the month we can sign off on the remaining chapters in the Accession Conference."
"Finally, a word about Greece, because I hope Member States will also have the occasion to discuss at the highest level this situation, which is important not only for a Member State of our Union but, I believe, for the stability of the euro area and for the stability of the European Union as a whole."
"The issue of Greece raises very important issues, not just in terms of financial stability, but also in terms of social commitment and in terms of the political determination of the European Union."
"Last night's vote in the Greek Parliament allows the government to build consensus in support of the reform package, agreed with the European Union and IMF, of fiscal measures, privatisations and reforms that are necessary in Greece's journey back to growth."
"Because, let us be absolutely clear, there is no alternative to this plan."
"So let us act upon it."
"I know that many people in Greece are living through a period of great hardship and uncertainty."
"My message to the Greek people is that if the government acts, Europe will deliver."
"If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF, we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth."
"Fiscal consolidation is entirely necessary, but the goal is growth."
"We should never forget that one euro spent on interest rates to pay the debt is one euro that cannot go to the people of Greece, so it is critically important to reduce debt and to control the deficit so that we can restore confidence in the Greek economy, in order to promote growth."
"At the same time, it is extremely important that the Greek people understand that in the face of such difficult circumstances a national consensus is necessary: a national consensus and not short-sighted partisan politics."
"We need a national consensus in Greece so that Greece can win the confidence of the partners and the markets in terms of the very important reforms that are needed."
"(Applause)"
"On Monday night I met with Prime Minister Papandreou, and we also discussed a more strategic use of our European structural funds."
"Greece has the potential to access a significant amount of European funds under the cohesion policy."
"I believe we should increase their rate of absorption and accelerate those funds, aiming for a significant impact on improving competitiveness and employment."
"This will be done within the existing funds."
"It will be a comprehensive programme of technical assistance focused on growth and jobs, but with an emergency character because - I repeat - Greece is living in an emergency situation."
"I will discuss these issues with the European Council: what we can do together with Greece."
"We, the Commission, can put this in place, bilaterally with the government, but I believe efforts are necessary from all those that can contribute, namely in terms of technical assistance coming from different Member States."
"The Greek Government is ready to engage with us in this approach."
"I believe we should also be ready to react in a very positive way, always on the basis of strict conditionality regarding the necessary reforms for that country."
"The implementation of Greece's reform plans calls for exceptional efforts from the Greek people."
"The Commission is now proposing an exceptional response as a sign to the Greek people that there is hope."
"They are making sacrifices, and we know they are making sacrifices, but at the end of that road there is hope, and solutions are within their reach."
"They are making some important cuts, but those cuts are necessary for growth."
"Growth is the answer, and we will work with the Greek authorities and the Greek people to achieve that objective."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Győri, I would firstly like to say a brief word to you, in acknowledgement of all the work you have done and especially of the methodical approach you employed and the hours you devoted to this work, with Parliament in particular."
"I think that is worth mentioning and so, once again, thank you."
"(Applause)"
"You are applauding her, but it could not have been any other way: we have trained her well within our group."
"Therefore, she knows what Parliament is all about."
"Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances."
"Seldom have expectations been so high among the people in our various countries, expectations of brave and united decisions from their leaders on the burning issue of the euro and the debt crisis, as well as on economic governance."
"In several countries, and especially in Greece, our fellow citizens are confused, anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children's future."
"I would like to take this opportunity to send out three messages to our Greek friends."
"Firstly, Europe is in solidarity with them, and we Europeans are doing everything within our means to extricate them from an extremely difficult situation, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility - and I stress the word responsibility."
"Secondly, the situation that they - and indeed many other countries in Europe - are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means."
"This has to be said, and I call for all Europeans to face up to reality."
"My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term."
"This will involve making sacrifices, but it will result in positive changes for the country in the end."
"This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country's twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation."
"Two different attitudes can be adopted with regard to the current situation: either people settle for marching in the streets and striking - that is part of the trade union movement (I myself was a trade unionist) - or, after having expressed their concern, they set about redressing the situation on the basis of a fair policy."
"My group, ladies and gentlemen, is calling for a shake-up."
"It is calling for all of our countries to wake up to the fact that changes are both necessary and beneficial."
"We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves - and when I say 'us', I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens."
"This brings me back to the European Council, from which we are awaiting confirmation of European solidarity."
"However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is appealing for the Community method to be used to negotiate the legislative package merely to prevent our Member States from being able to shirk their obligations too easily, as they have done in the past."
"When the Council, with Parliament, decides upon economic regulations to be complied with by the 27 Member States, it is not so that they can be waived at the first opportunity."
"We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with."
"If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past."
"I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that."
"I will conclude on a positive note, by welcoming the anticipated Council decision on the forthcoming accession of Croatia, which is set to become the European Union's 28th Member State in a few months' time."
"This decision will reward the tremendous efforts made by the Croatian people and their government, whose courage and sense of public good I wish to commend."
"This accession is an important and positive signal for Europeans, who are doubting themselves right now."
"However, the values that Europe embodies - solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity - have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else."
"I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing."
"I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely has the European Parliament prepared for a European Council meeting during a worse crisis."
"I believe that we should be under no illusions."
"This European Council meeting will be a historic one, because it will decide on the future of this Union."
"I read an interesting line in a German newspaper this week."
"The markets - writes the German newspaper - distrust the European Union because they no longer trust it to find solutions to the problems."
"The people of Europe, the citizens, distrust the European Union because they no longer trust the governments to find solutions to their problems."
"We are in a severe crisis."
"We are in a crisis of confidence in the European project."
"We all have the crisis that we deserve."
"Our problems have been known for a long time."
"The question is whether we intend to address them in a bold or a despondent way, and whether we have courage to do so or whether cowardice will bring us to our knees."
"I will say one thing, which is perhaps one of the most unpopular messages that could be given in Europe right now."
"I will say it nevertheless, because I am firmly convinced that it is right."
"We do not need less Europe, we need more of it!"
"We need more courage to overcome the crisis using European resources."
"(Applause)"
"Why do we need more Europe?"
"This Council meeting is mainly about two things."
"Firstly, the Heads of State or Government must regain their governance, because it is not the Heads of State or Government alone that decide."
"In this world in which we live there are 43 companies with a balance sheet totalling more than the national budget of a medium-sized EU Member State like Poland."
"That means that there are 43 heads of companies that are at least as powerful as the Polish Prime Minister."
"These people also decide on the fate of the people of this continent."
"Has the fact actually ever been discussed - and this is another issue - that always right on time just prior to an Ecofin meeting, just before a European Council, one, two or three credit rating agencies assess whatever is on the table as a solution to the problems as being inappropriate?"
"Who in actual fact are the people who are wielding the real power over economic development in Europe?"
"Who is behind them?"
"Who is actually paying the credit rating agencies for their ratings?"
"They are clearly not working simply for a reward in heaven."
"Of course, they receive money for their proposals from stakeholders."
"The Heads of State or Government must have the courage to regain the sovereignty of their national, democratic power to act."
"The only way that they can do this is by uniting."
"(Applause)"
"They will not be able to do this if they split into their constituent parts."
"The EU currently has 7.8% of the world's population in its 27 Member States."
"Population statistics tell us that in 2050 only 4% of the world's population will live here."
"The remaining 96% of the world's population will not only take their bearings from Europe."
"The emerging powers and the emerging economies of this world are not waiting for Europe to split into its constituent parts, from large parts like Germany down to very small parts like Malta, in the belief that each individual part will be able to survive on its own - the renationalisation rhetoric that many politicians are giving their people."
"We will only survive in intercontinental competition - environmental, economic, financial and monetary - if we unite."
"If we have the shared will to make the strongest economy in the world - because that is what Europe is if it holds together - into a success by standing together in solidarity."
"Solidarity means sharing."
"Strong shoulders more so than weak shoulders."
"For us, incidentally, that does not mean a financial tax; it means a financial transaction tax."
"If I go to the supermarket and buy a carton of milk, I pay value added tax."
"If I sell a financial product, I pay no tax."
"That is not right."
"Therefore we need this financial transaction tax."
"(Applause)"
"All of these things have been explained."
"They are on the table."
"Either we will manage to knit Europe together in unity and not play one nation off against the others, or play the feelings of one off against the feelings of the others, or the European integration project is in real danger."
"However, if the European Union fails as a transnational project for securing peace and prosperity and breaks apart, then it will be more than just a political union that breaks apart."
"Then the demons of the 20th century that plunged this continent into misery will quickly reappear."
"The defence of Europe is more than one European summit, it is the defence of a great idea."
"(Applause)"
"Welcome"
"I would like to welcome the delegation from Mexico comprising members of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies and Senate, who are present in the official gallery."
"Preparations for the European Council meeting (24 June 2011) (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council meeting of 23-24 June 2011."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all the key question of this debate today is what we can expect from this European Council on Thursday and on Friday."
"What I hope, and what my group is hoping - as, I think, are the majority in this Parliament - is that we can end this Summit with a more decisive, more comprehensive and bolder approach to the current crisis."
"Let us be honest, we do not have a global comprehensive approach to this current crisis."
"It is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament."
"I would say to Martin Schulz that I also have some questions about rating agencies and the role they are playing in the current crisis, but let us try to find errors and the sources of the crisis within our own ranks, and maybe not outside the European Union and outside its institutions."
"Let us be honest about another thing: the crisis is not over."
"Those who think that by giving some additional money to Greece this crisis will come to an end - as regards Greece and the euro - are wrong."
"This crisis is not over, and this crisis will continue if, first of all, we do not find a structural solution for Greece and, secondly, if we do not create a real, economic and political union in Europe."
"Such measures should end the crisis as regards the euro and Greece."
"Again, is it possible to have one currency and 17 governments, 17 economic strategies and 17 bond markets - as we have today and is a situation which does not exist elsewhere in the world?"
"It is only us in Europe who think that we can have one monetary union and 17 different policies, 17 different governments and 17 different bond markets."
"It is not only us - the federalists in the European Parliament - who are saying that."
"Yesterday, Mr Lipsky, the current Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that Europe should create one political and economic union to face this crisis."
"Yesterday it was Mr Geithner, the US Minister of Finance, who was saying 'maybe they can stop and talk with each other; let them create an economic and political union'."
"If they know on the other side of the Atlantic what we have to do, why do we not have the courage to take this enormous step forward to an economic and political union?"
"That is the key question for the tomorrow's Council."
"As regards my second point, we need to help Greece - and not only in a defensive way."
"We need a bold austerity programme, and that is currently what is being discussed with the Greek Government."
"Maybe there are plans to go further than what is on the table now."
"If so, we need a positive plan for it."
"They cannot emerge from the crisis based only on austerity."
"They need to have growth and investment and we can deliver on that within the European Union."
"Let us, for example, give guarantees for private investment."
"Private investment no longer exists in Greece."
"Let us give them loans from the European Investment Bank."
"Why not use part of the privatisation programme not for fiscal consolidation but to create new investment and growth in Greece."
"I now have a request for Mr Daul, and will therefore continue in French."
"(FR) I am going to make my comment in French."
"Mr Daul's group comprises members of the Nea Dimokratia party."
"We need to be very clear on that."
"Moreover, if we want all the other countries to give money to Greece, we also need a political consensus to be reached in Greece."
"I believe that we can call on Mr Daul, who was right in what he said, to convince his political friends to reach this political consensus in order to deliver this policy for Greece."
"(Applause)"
"That is what we need."
"I am well aware that it is an onerous task that we are setting you, Mr Daul, but I know that you are capable of rising to this challenge."
"It is true that a country in such a situation yearns for political unity, and it is not by playing petty political games, as is currently the case in Greece, that this situation will be resolved."
"I experienced this in Belgium for nine years, Mr Lange."
"Mr President, let us be very honest."
"We need a bolder economic governance package than we have on the table today."
"I want to ask President Barroso something directly: yesterday, the spokesman for the European Commission said at the press conference that there was no need for more reverse QMV in the governance package."
"I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to rectify this."
"I would ask that the Commission, together with the European Parliament, employ a more Communitarian method for the economic governance package."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber."
"(FR) Mr President, in most of the countries to which Mr Daul was referring, we are in a coalition with the Christian Democrats, so that certainly must have an impact."
"However, I do not think it appropriate, this afternoon before such an important Council meeting, to play the party political card by pitting one particular government against another."
"I urge you, Mr Daul, not to pit the liberals against the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) or against the socialists."
"What I was asking of you was to convince your friends from the Nea Dimokratia, a party of which, incidentally, many of the members are also our friends and have even, in some cases, moved over to my group, and which has only one aim: to unite the people of Greece so that they can emerge from the crisis they are going through."
"You can play a major role in this."
"I am counting on you."
"(The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions from Mr Koumoutsakos and Mr Ransdorf under Rule 149(8))"
"(EL) Mr President, I was delighted to hear Mr Verhofstadt say that everyone now realises that Greece's problem is a European problem."
"What does Greece have a duty to do?"
"Greece has a duty to push ahead with major structural reforms and privatisations."
"I should therefore like to advise Mr Verhofstadt, because he has obviously been misled, that on these two issues, which form the cornerstone of the reforms, Nea Dimokratia has not only agreed; it was Nea Dimokratia that made the proposals."
"These are Nea Dimokratia proposals, which the government has been unable to implement for 18 months now."
"That is the truth."
"(CS) Mr President, I listened attentively to Mr Verhofstadt, the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I would like to ask him whether I am correct in thinking that his motto might be that Greece is everywhere, since Greece is not just a Member State of the European Union, but is actually a state of mind, and that Greece is therefore everywhere."
"Mr President, it is obvious that if we do not resolve the Greek problem we will have huge problems in the whole euro zone."
"We already have problems in Portugal today; we already have problems in Ireland today."
"The difference in spreads today - between Portugal and Germany, between Ireland and Germany - is more than 800 basic points."
"So what we are doing - with the solidarity that we needed from the beginning of this crisis but which was not there - is not only for Greece; it has to be for all Member States of the euro zone."
"It was because of this lack of solidarity that, in December 2009, we created a far bigger problem - the problem we are facing today."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, it is very entertaining today in the House."
"There are still, let me remind you, a lot of us who experienced Communism and who since then have made enormous and swift progress to prepare ourselves for membership of the European Union."
"We were rightly made to prove ourselves, to prove that we met the Copenhagen criteria, to prove that we enjoyed fully-functioning market economies and so on and so forth, but unfortunately this level of scrutiny was not applied to some European countries when entering the euro zone."
"Why?"
"Simply because it was constructed as a political and not as an economic project, and therefore the criteria were ignored; figures were changed to bring in countries that were not yet ready."
"That is the core of the problem, and now we are living out the consequences and we are at a turning point."
"Believe me, despite the fact that most members of my group are from non-euro zone member countries, we do not want the euro to fail."
"At the same time, it cannot be defended at any cost."
"We are surely on the final pages of the bail-out chapter."
"This European Council should send a clear signal that if a country's position is unsustainable within the euro zone then, unless it makes dramatic changes, the euro zone should not hesitate to raise the possibility of restructuring its debt or even - however cruel it might seem - of its leaving the club."
"Mr Barroso, if you do not do that, then I will tell you what will happen next: your opponents - or rather the opponents of your successor - will not be nice, decent Eurosceptics like me, but really nasty anti-Europeans."
"And why?"
"Because they will be elected by angry German taxpayers and by desperate French and Dutch private entrepreneurs fed up of paying other people's debts, and I know that neither you nor I want this to happen."
"So let us act accordingly."
"In the same way, I would ask you to please stop using or misusing every crisis as an opportunity to pursue further the supra-nationalistic agenda towards something like fiscal union or tax union, because it leads us nowhere."
"This is not a crisis of Europe."
"This is just a crisis of one wrong, outdated concept of European integration, and that is all."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, I am amazed at how raucous the debate on the deepest crisis that the European Union has experienced for a long time has suddenly become."
"When we realise that we are currently defending Schengen, that we have been unable to defend the freedom of the press in Hungary during this Council Presidency, that we needed a long time even to begin to find a common European language with regard to Libya and Egypt, then it is no wonder that, in the face of the worsening situation in Greece, all we can say is that, although we now have many leaders in Europe, we have no leadership."
"I believe that that is one of the major problems that has not been properly addressed."
"In this crisis that has lasted much longer than the Greek crisis, we are also in a situation where all of the solutions that the Council comes up with are coming too late and are too narrow in scope."
"The idea that the European Union can only continue in the way that we want it to and also provide a better life for all Europeans if we rescue Greece and stabilise the South is one that has not been communicated at all up to now, and I believe there is actually an institution responsible for this and that is the European Council."
"I would say that Parliament is not always a shining example, either."
"For example, Parliament refused to come together in good time prior to this historic Council meeting to adopt a resolution to address the problems relating precisely to this historic crisis."
"I found it very regrettable that even those Members on the left who sit here to my right were not able to gather themselves together in good time to make a statement on behalf of Parliament with regard to Greece."
"I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece, because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia."
"However, with regard to justice, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also has a responsibility towards Mr Papandreou and his government."
"As pleased as I am that he received a vote of confidence yesterday, the Greek Government will also be involved in deciding on fair programmes in the crisis."
"The fact that this is so unfairly distributed, that the burden is only being borne by the lower sections of society, that no capital levy is being introduced in Greece and that tax evasion is also widespread in Greece is an unfair situation."
"The national solidarity that was mentioned must also result in the elite in Greece, who are after all even today still profiting from the crisis, also taking their share of the responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"We stick by everything that we have already said on many occasions with regard to Greece."
"Longer timeframes, more favourable loans - we believe that there also needs to be a gentle, systematic and secure rescheduling of debt."
"I believe that it is an expression of the incompetence of the political leadership in the European Union that what we have recognised to be right, namely that private creditors must also share the burden, is not implemented because we are afraid of the credit rating agencies."
"Therefore, the issue that brought us into this crisis is still the dominating factor and so far there has been no political leadership to tackle this."
"I believe that this is the main issue that needs to be discussed during the European Council meeting in the next few days."
"Mr Barroso, I wish you luck with your plan for fairer taxation as a way out of the crisis."
"I do not know whether you are still pursuing the financial transaction tax."
"We are still in favour of it."
"This Parliament has expressed its support for this many times."
"However, I also believe that tax evasion, unfair bonuses and all the factors that helped to cause the financial crash have not as yet been addressed. That is also your responsibility."
"Thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something."
"Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece."
"However, everything is just continuing as before."
"Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded."
"At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States."
"The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model."
"Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things."
"However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets."
"The consequences can still be felt today."
"I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however."
"Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks."
"In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told."
"In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop."
"Things will just carry on as before."
"The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy."
"However, we lack the courage to do this."
"The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with."
"That is where the problem lies."
"We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors."
"This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground."
"I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be 'let us carry on as before'."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one."
"Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, 'no no, there is no problem'."
"Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, 'there is no alternative'."
"We must continue down this route."
"We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next."
"What a fine mess you have got us into."
"You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won't."
"It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months' time."
"I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package."
"They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression."
"They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy."
"They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse."
"You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy."
"What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return."
"Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work."
"Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts."
"If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to ask Mr Farage if he knows how big the United Kingdom's foreign debt is and if he believes that the United Kingdom, as an island, could manage on its own."
"Mr President, the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago."
"We were part of the exchange rate mechanism."
"We were trapped, trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been."
"It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily."
"Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s."
"You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world."
"We learned our lesson."
"We did not join the euro, thank God."
"Those who did are, I am afraid, currently trapped inside an economic prison."
"(NL) Mr President, last Tuesday Mr Barroso said that Greece can count on European support."
"'Europe will deliver', he said."
"What does Mr Barroso actually base this power upon?"
"Is it not the case that financial aid for Greece is expressly prohibited under the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"Is it not the case that national parliaments have to approve such aid individually?"
"Is it not the case that they are also allowed to say 'no'?"
"The power of the Commission is expanding further and further."
"It is time we put a stop to that."
"The Commission sees itself as the governor of all European countries, as the ultimate decision-maker under the leadership of Mr Barroso."
"Mr Barroso was not elected democratically."
"No European citizen voted for this man."
"I have but one word for a government that rules without democracy, and that word is 'dictatorship'."
"A bureaucratic dictatorship that wants to subjugate the Greeks and that also wants to call the shots in the Netherlands."
"It is unacceptable that Mr Barroso should decide whether the Netherlands should grant aid."
"There is only one body that can rule on whether the Netherlands should help Greece and that is the Dutch Parliament."
"Granting aid to Greece is useless."
"It harms the Dutch economy and Dutch citizens."
"On that point, Mr Barroso was actually right."
"After all, on Tuesday, he also said himself that, even if the Greek debt disappeared by magic, the problem would not be resolved."
"The European summit really cannot reach any other conclusion."
"The only long-term solution to this problem is for the Greeks to reintroduce the drachma, which could be devalued on its own."
"That way, the other Member States would not have to pick up the tab."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to answer two concrete questions that were put to me."
"I will not enter into this ideological discussion against Europe in which, may I say, it is interesting to see the extreme right and extreme left united against the euro and against the European project."
"That is why I want once again to appeal to all the democratic forces in Europe, in this Parliament, in Greece, to unite in a consensus to do everything possible to ensure growth and prosperity in Europe."
"The two concrete questions were about the financial tax and about our position on reverse qualified majority."
"On the financial tax, I want to confirm that the proposal that the Commission will put forward, probably in October, will be on a financial transaction tax."
"We have made an impact assessment."
"We believe there are two possibilities: a financial transaction tax and a financial activities tax."
"We have decided to come forward now with a proposal on a financial transaction tax, one reason being precisely that there is no equivalent of VAT for financial transactions."
"So we will come forward with that proposal by October."
"(Applause)."
"The second issue was raised by Mr Verhofstadt."
"I want to make it clear that the Commission supports Parliament on reverse qualified majority voting."
"We have been supporting your ambitious position."
"At the same time - and Olli Rehn will have the opportunity to address you later this afternoon - we will make a strong appeal to you and to the Council to see if it is possible to come to a final agreement."
"Because we also believe that, thanks to Parliament's positions, great progress has been achieved in terms of the package that is now up for consideration."
"I want to congratulate you, the Parliament, those that have been working most on this matter, and also the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, as it has done some very important work as well."
"At the end, I want to say to all of you that, in terms of responsibility, the cost of not having an agreement on this matter will be extremely high, considering the current situation."
"The Commission supports the Community approach."
"The Commission supports the greatest possible ambition, which is the line that I think that you are also defining."
"These are the concrete answers to the concrete questions."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said with regard to Greece."
"I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter."
"The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles."
"The two principles that define Europe are solidarity - we stand by this - and a sense of individual responsibility - that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves."
"The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union."
"I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light."
"We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes."
"For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year."
"This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone."
"In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration."
"However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe's major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism."
"I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy."
"However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone."
"It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did."
"It was internal policymaking by Italy's minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi."
"On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons."
"In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature."
"I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting."
"When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area."
"Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe."
"Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament's support in that."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would firstly like to say a few words on a subject that is close to my heart and that, of course, is Croatia."
"I hope that we will succeed in taking a decision to allow Croatia truly to be accepted into the European Union now."
"The Commission has done a good job here - Commissioner Füle, you yourself Mr Barroso and also the Hungarian Presidency in this regard."
"It would be a good and important signal to a problematic region like the Balkans if the country that has completed its task well were to be next in line."
"When I say 'completed its task' that does not mean that all of the problems are solved."
"We have just experienced some unacceptable situations in Split in connection with the Gay Parade."
"However, it is important for the government to stand up for fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights."
"Allow me to add a few words with regard to Greece."
"Mr Barroso, you said that it will be difficult to explain it to citizens if we do not come up with a solution, for example in connection with the economic governance package."
"However, Mr Barroso, it will also be difficult to explain it to citizens if we only concentrate on austerity."
"You talked about growth and said that we need something to promote growth - but what exactly, Mr Barroso?"
"You cannot believe that austerity alone will lead to growth if we do not at the same time offer alternatives."
"Mr Verhofstadt mentioned a few problems."
"It is not only left-leaning economists - in its economics section yesterday, for example, Le Monde, which is not a left-leaning newspaper, made it quite clear: austerity on the one hand - yes, we need certain restrictions - but we also need growth and investment."
"When there is talk of privatisations, Mr Barroso, you know exactly how to force Greece quickly into a wave of privatisations now - just as Mr Bisky said, things are being sold off."
"However, we must give Greece time to privatise those things that it is sensible to do so at a point in time when it will receive an adequate amount of money for them."
"Secondly, we have to say that we also need to invest some of the money."
"If you say that you want to release regional funds and resources from the Structural Funds then we need to move away from the obligation for cofinancing, because otherwise Greece will not be able to use them."
"These are all proposals that we are waiting for from the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"We are in favour of a frugal policy and of savings where these are necessary, and we are in favour of restrictions and restructuring measures."
"However, it will not work without growth."
"At the end of the day, if we carry on as we are, we will not rescue Greece or our banks, nor will we save our taxpayers; we will instead end up in chaos."
"Therefore, Mr Barroso - and this of course applies to the Council, too - in addition to the structural measures, we also need growth."
"Proposals for growth and employment are crucial for the future of Greece and also for that of Europe."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(CS) Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Swoboda whether he agrees with the view that the crisis is being used in certain Member States as a tool for relieving citizens of their assets by stealth."
"Does he also see it in this way?"
"(DE) Mr President, in all of the countries that are experiencing a crisis, there have been genuine problems."
"There is absolutely no point in denying that."
"This situation can be abused from two different sides."
"It can be abused, as some credit rating agencies are doing, for example, by giving advice that drives countries to ruin."
"However, it can also be abused by making political statements to the effect that we do not need to change anything."
"If some of the demonstrators, in Greece for example or in other countries, believe that we do not need to change anything and that we can carry on as before, then they are wrong."
"We are therefore in favour of giving our full support to the measures proposed by Mr Papandreou's government."
"These measures are a step in the right direction."
"They must be supported, and that is something that some of the trade unionists in Greece also need to recognise - the only way to overcome this is if, at the same time, we pursue a policy of growth together."
"I wanted to make that absolutely clear."
"In other words, no abuse from either side."
"That is extremely important."
"(DE) Mr President, following the confidence vote yesterday in Athens with the result that we are all aware of, the Bild newspaper in Germany printed the headline 'Greek leader has survived - Europe can breathe a sigh of relief'."
"I have to say that I was also pleased with the result of this vote, but I think it is far too early to breathe a sigh of relief."
"This is because we now need to put the substantial austerity package successfully in place in the next week."
"That is the next big test."
"Even then, we will be a long way from being able to breathe a sigh of relief."
"Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome."
"I believe that what has been said here is right."
"The people in Greece need a light at the end of the tunnel."
"However, I would also like to make it quite clear that the people in the countries from which most of the aid is coming also need a light at the end of the tunnel."
"They have the feeling that they are giving and giving and giving and there is no end to it."
"In Greece the people have the feeling that they are saving and saving and saving and there is no end to it."
"That is why a growth strategy is so important."
"That is why privatisations are crucial to break open and liberalise this encrusted economy."
"That is why it is right for us resolutely to promote and support the reduction of public debt in Greece."
"Democracy has to endorse this."
"What is happening with respect to Mr Samaras is totally irresponsible."
"However, it is right for us to give guarantees for investments, for example."
"It is also right for us to draw out unused EU funds, Mr Barroso, and make them available to Greece, because ultimately it will not only be Greece but the whole of Europe that will benefit from more growth."
"If we look ahead slightly, one thing is also important: the Stability and Growth Pact must be strengthened."
"We must prevent future crises."
"This is where this reverse qualified majority comes in."
"No ordinary citizen will understand what that actually means."
"To put it plainly, either the Stability and Growth Pact has this strange technical element that I have just mentioned, and then the Stability and Growth Pact will have teeth, or else it does not."
"Then we will not be able to support this package."
"Reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive phase of the Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely essential as far as we are concerned."
"Mr Barroso, I am extremely pleased to hear you explain once again that the Commission is of exactly the same opinion."
"I would like to see substantial support for this project from this House."
"(DE) Mr President, thank you Mr Lambsdorff, I am of the opinion that Greece urgently needs political unity."
"However, that of course starts with the fact that the proposals put forward there must ultimately be fair."
"There will only be unity in the country if there is renewed trust in the political and economic elite there."
"For that to be possible, the proposals made need to bring about unity."
"However, the question that I would like to ask you is this: I would also like to see some consistency in your group."
"Here you are calling for Eurobonds, but in Germany you have declared Eurobonds to be a kind of blasphemy."
"It is from your group in the German parliament that we see the greatest opposition to common European ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Giegold, you cannot use the blue-card procedure if you are not going to ask a question."
"Therefore, Mr Graf Lambsdorff surely has nothing to answer."
"(EL) Mr President, as a Greek, I should like to thank the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament for all the support they have given Greece to date."
"In particular, I should like to thank everyone in the Commission who has been working so hard for 18 months now to resolve the Greek crisis."
"We have talked about Europe a great deal in the European Parliament today."
"I should just like to make one patriotic comment in this multinational Chamber."
"We Greeks gave Europe its name and we made a decisive contribution to what we refer to as 'European civilisation' and 'European values'."
"What are we Greek politicians and the Greek people asking for?"
"We are asking for your respect and your solidarity."
"What can we promise?"
"That we shall work very hard to put the country which we brought to this point - this is, first and foremost, our problem and we are to blame - back on its feet."
"Allow me to make three proposals: ....."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the presence of large numbers of alleged asylum seekers from Libya and Tunisia will be on the agenda."
"Tunisia is a country that has toppled its dictator, so what are these Tunisians fleeing from?"
"Democracy?"
"Perhaps we should expect to see Mr Ben Ali, a recently retired dictator, at the head of the queue."
"Libya is a war zone."
"But people do not become asylum seekers simply because they live in a dangerous country."
"There must be something about that particular person that places that person in jeopardy."
"The argument seems to be about whether Italy or Malta should accept them for settlement because they are the first country they reached, or whether they should be accepted for settlement by other Member States."
"My answer is that neither should accept them for settlement and they should sooner or later be returned to North Africa."
"If EU asylum rules really say that a mere claim to be an asylum seeker is enough to create an obligation to accept them, then the rules must be changed."
"Rules are man-made and can be unmade."
"If that means Member States, and indeed the EU itself, repudiating other international agreements, then so be it."
"Member States have been changed beyond recognition by migration."
"The time has come to stop the flow and encourage its reversal."
"The accession of Croatia is also on the agenda."
"What steps will the EU take to ensure the referendum will be held fairly, with both sides being heard and equal amounts of money being spent?"
"I suspect that a free and fair referendum in not on the cards."
"The country will be deluged with EU propaganda and those arguing against Croatia's accession will be phased out of the debate."
"(HU) Mr President, the next European Council meeting will also be about trust."
"We have reached a historic moment."
"It is historic, because we will identify the challenges that the European Union has to face, and to which we now have to give nothing but responsible answers."
"These answers, however, are closely interconnected."
"First, however, I would like to congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on its great work and express my thanks for it."
"In particular, I would like to thank Minister of State Enikő Győri, who was always present everywhere, for her work."
"She set a strict timetable that the Presidency as a whole managed to keep, while maintaining a Parliament-friendly attitude, for which I thank them again."
"This half-year has been a real challenge, because it was not only a new task for the Hungarian Presidency, but the tasks themselves were new as well."
"Just think about the initiation and institutionalisation of the European semester, and the 'six-pack' of economic governance, created within the framework of the co-decision procedure, that will bring a fundamentally new economic approach."
"There are great expectations towards the approaching Council meeting, and towards issues of the package that have yet to be resolved through compromise."
"At the same time, the Council and Parliament bear a huge responsibility over the agreement, because they have to decide whether they want to follow the bad practices that have lead to the weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and indirectly to the crisis as well, or put an end to the policy of agreements made at Member State level and bad bargains, and finally give space to a new economic policy approach that will offer common European solutions, is built on commonly established rules, and will finally complete the economic policy aspect of integration, with a strong Europe in focus."
"Citizens, national parliaments and the markets all expect the European Union to shape the European economy uniformly, following commonly accepted rules, to ensure the stability of the common currency and to protect European citizens from the crisis efficiently."
"(ES) Mr President, the Members of the European Parliament fully understand that the debate on the European Council which is set to be held on 23 and 24 June will continue to focus on the persistent crisis and the problems faced by the euro, and Greece."
"However, I should like to join those who have pointed out that the agenda does not end there."
"We also have a duty to discuss the question marks raised over elements that are central to the area of freedom, justice and security, specifically Schengen, which is probably the key asset for the free movement of persons."
"We cannot allow the cry for democracy that has spread across North Africa to be met with anything other than a clear, categorical response."
"Moreover, this response cannot be a reform of the Schengen Treaty."
"On the contrary, it should be a strengthening of the Schengen Treaty."
"There are precedents clearly indicating that, faced with unexpected, abrupt migratory pressures, as was the case in the Canary Islands, in Spain, between 2004 and 2006, the response given cannot just be more, better Europe, but also a supportive contribution to the demand for better democracy in the neighbouring countries."
"We know that Malta, Italy and France have been subjected to this pressure, but we have to be very clear that the Council must do its part by completing the asylum package, completing the immigration package, completing the reform of the Frontex Regulation and, not least, by updating the solidarity clause included in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which means updating Directive 2001/55/EC."
"Lastly, I should also like to express my concern about the message that has been sent out, aimed at instituting a response mechanism that will enable re-establishment of the Union's internal borders in certain extraordinary circumstances."
"We must be extremely clear about what we are dealing with and what the European dimension will be, strictly in relation to the EU institutions, so that we will not find ourselves on a slippery, or indeed counterproductive, slope."
"Mr President, after an era of openness, tolerance and enthusiasm for Europe, we have seen in recent years a deterioration of our unity and a division among Europeans, even in this House, on issues such as freedom of movement, immigration, national interest and, above all, money."
"Unfortunately, this global economic crisis highlights the worst of our nationalist and populist views."
"The chaos of daily declarations on Greece by national politicians and stakeholders is only adding to the confusion and creating more speculation on the markets."
"The risk of contamination of every single Member State is a real one."
"While Greece shares its burden of responsibility in its crisis, our European leaders share theirs as well."
"If a year ago the EU had shown a unified and total commitment to helping Greece, we would not now be jumping from one rescue plan to another."
"We do not need more technical solutions."
"What we need is cohesion, determination and unity, because what we are playing is a psychological war and what the market is testing is Europe's unity, not the Greek austerity plan."
"It is crucial to send an unequivocal message of support and encouragement that Europe is standing behind Greece."
"In addition, we should lower the interest rate and show more flexibility in accessing EU funds."
"Besides, Greece must also be ready to take its fate in its hands."
"While reforms and austerity measures are necessary, we should also remember that this is not enough in the long term to recover."
"We must go back to the basics, encourage investment and promote growth."
"I hope that tomorrow no European leader will default on solidarity, because Greece is just a page in the book which is Europe; so if we stand by Greece, we stand by Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of Greece I will say that one only needs to listen to what has been discussed to realise what stage European governance is at."
"In fact it is steering by sight, with no precise aims."
"We have not been told anything for which I would keep my fingers crossed if I were a Greek citizen - perhaps a Greek worker or a small Greek entrepreneur facing ruin."
"As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees."
"A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country."
"In practice, nobody is receiving them, and she highlighted the positive case of Norway."
"They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta, and we are the only ones taking them in."
"Italy has received them."
"Italy."
"People were talking about Minister Bossi, and there is also the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Maroni: both ministers are from this racist Lega Nord party, which has received the refugees."
"Unless there is proof to the contrary, that is the truth."
"Lastly there is the Croatia chapter."
"It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely the complexity and, if you like, the toughness of the agenda for the Council of 24 June that bring us up against the shortcomings of the instruments available to us."
"What exactly is available to us?"
"The European Union is."
"The European Union is a work in progress, an unfinished work, which we have so often failed to complete precisely because of our weakness and fear."
"The European Union is available to us, but the United States of Europe is not."
"That means that, when national governments are wavering due to internal issues, we do not have an instrument that we can activate in order to implement what might be a solution to our problems."
"To succeed in finally making the United States of Europe available to us will require leadership not only from the national governments but primarily from the European institutions."
"I believe - President Barroso is not here any more - that his prudence won him his second election."
"I would very much like to vote for him for a third time, but this time for his courage."
"In other words, as he has been re-elected once for his prudence, I would like to re-elect him for a third term for his courage."
"Therefore, given the tough agenda to be tackled by the Council on 24 June, I expect the leadership shown by the Commission and the European institutions to persuade the national governments to put our ideals before whatever is in our interests."
"I think that is the only feasible way forward."
"Otherwise, we will continue to hold debates in which we grumble about the fact that perhaps the French Government has taken an initiative about Schengen for internal reasons, or the Italian Government has refused to admit someone or other, or the Greek Government is still too weak to really be able to take responsibility for its own decisions."
"The main issue, however, lies elsewhere: unless the political nature of the European project is clarified, we will be incapable of dealing with our problems."
"(EL) Mr President, may I start by adding my thanks to those expressed by Mrs Tzavela - and I wish to thank her for that - to the parliaments and people of Europe for the support which they have given and are continuing to give to my country."
"As developments over the last few days have illustrated, Greece is determined to continue with and make a success of its efforts to restructure its finances and promote structural reform."
"However, if these efforts are to be crowned with success, two conditions need to be satisfied."
"The first condition is that we must be able to give the people not just austerity, but also positive prospects, prospects of growth, prospects of employment and prospects of new jobs."
"The second condition is that we need an environment of security and support from the European Union, an environment of political cohesion because, throughout the crisis and, in particular, over the last few weeks, we have seen an informal public dialogue between European capitals, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, with the credit rating agencies acting as a strange sort of referee, in connection with the much talked about involvement of the private sector in the new Greek bail-out."
"This strange sort of refereeing does not do credit either to the European Union or to political union."
"We need to silence this cacophony, because it is only in an environment of political cohesion that we can hope for the right conditions that will allow the tremendous efforts being made by the Greek people to be crowned with success."
"Mr President, the big question facing EU leaders tomorrow is whether they are up to the task of saving European achievements in the common currency and free-movement zone."
"'More Europe' is not the answer to everything, but on key issues like these we do need strengthened ability for European decision-making."
"I welcome President Barroso's much tougher statement today than in our debate on Schengen and migration in May."
"He should then have read the riot act to Italy and France in the way that Manfred Weber of the PPE did earlier in this debate."
"In an excellent article published in the Financial Times yesterday, Mario Monti deplored both the excessive deference to big Member States and the 'culture of politeness' in the Council, which meant that Member States refused to call each other to account for failings."
"I would rather more crudely call it: 'I will scratch your back if you scratch mine'."
"This was disastrous over the issue of Greece's fraudulent statistics."
"We need EU-level powers of decision and action on major issues, but we also need the honesty without which mutual trust is impossible."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that no country can face the problem of immigration alone."
"It is essential to have a policy governing large migration movements that supports development cooperation and provides for multilateral and bilateral agreements with the migrants' countries of origin and of transit."
"Unfortunately, the new European external action instruments have not been used in the spirit or with the vision of the Treaties, as Italy is now finding."
"The front-line Member States have in fact had to face the refugee crisis by means of unilateral initiatives, without being able to rely on European solidarity."
"I therefore call on the Commission to define the cases in which we can talk of a 'mass influx of displaced persons' under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection, thereby setting precise, measurable criteria that can be regarded as permanent."
"Such clarification is important for promoting an effective common policy on migration and ensuring that the burden is shared."
"(FR) Mr President, I too would like to offer my warm congratulations to Minister Győri, President-in-Office of the Council, on her Presidency."
"I would also like to welcome the Vice-President of the European Commission and make two remarks."
"The first concerns Greece."
"I think there is a need to consolidate the financial situation and to devise measures to promote growth."
"With regard to financial consolidation, it is clear that dealing with the past while planning for the future is extremely difficult."
"I propose the creation of a kind of credit mediator, which could house Greece's bad debt in a suitable financial, or hive-off, structure."
"Since the political consensus we have reached is not to allow capital losses, why not split the Greek debt up and thus allow the Greek Government to manage the future and this mediator basically to sort out the past through restructuring?"
"As regards interest rates, a contribution is required from the banks, which made huge profits by purchasing debts at 16% and then doubled their capital when they dropped to 8%."
"I also propose an investigation into financial transactions involving sovereign debt, which the European Securities and Markets Authority could be entrusted with carrying out."
"Credit institutions have to a certain extent provided what we call, in French law, a form of unfair assistance to an over-indebted structure."
"They are therefore guilty of misconduct and have caused harm: they need to make amends for that."
"On the subject of growth, we must support President Barroso's proposed EUR 1 billion plan, and we must deliver a proper development plan for Greece."
"I approve of the idea put forward by Mr Cohn-Bendit: why not focus on military expenditure, which accounts for 4% of GDP?"
"Furthermore, if the European Union could arbitrate between Turkey and Cyprus, I believe we would save Greece 2% of its GDP."
"Those are the kinds of measures which would help bring about a development plan for Greece."
"(PT) Mr President, my expectations for the forthcoming Council are rather low, because division reigns in the European Union: instead of decision there is hesitation, and instead of solidarity there is selfishness."
"That is how Europe is going."
"Let us look at the case of Greece."
"I am not going to talk about my own country, Portugal, because the new government has only just come to power."
"All I can do, therefore, is to wish it every success for the sakes both of the Portuguese and of Europe."
"Let us talk about Greece, then."
"Greece is not just any country."
"It has been a full Member of the European Union for decades, and it belongs to the Euro Group."
"It is important to remember that Greece was the cradle of democracy."
"These facts should be enough for Greece to be treated with greater respect by the European Union."
"The Greeks are responsible for the terrible situation that they are in, but so are the European institutions."
"Mr Papandreou, the Prime Minister, has done everything in his power to get out of this difficult situation."
"With enormous courage and dignity he has adopted the austerity measures, whether they are feasible or unfeasible."
"What is happening to Greece may one day apply to Ireland or Portugal, to Spain or Belgium, or to Italy or France."
"I have a question for the European institutions: how can countries in difficulties bear the scandalous interest rates imposed on them and at the same time reduce their budget deficit and public debt and promote economic growth and create jobs?"
"Do you not think that with that kind of treatment these countries run the risk of dying not from the disease but from the cure?"
"That is not the right path."
"What is needed is a concerted plan to defend the single currency, to fight off speculation on sovereign debts and to denounce the rating agencies, which are primarily to blame for the crisis we are undergoing."
"(FR) Mr President, the first precaution to be taken if we want to prevent a large-scale blaze is to stop playing with fire."
"I agree with President Barroso when he states that the Greek Government must do everything it can to put its house in order so that the European Union can, in turn, take action."
"In other words, Greece must regain its credibility."
"Does the same call for responsible behaviour not deserve to be addressed to all the governments in the EU?"
"Are all the political leaders aware of the impact of the statements they have made about Greece over the last 18 months?"
"The time has come for the European Council to put a stop, tomorrow, to the discord among its members."
"Four things are needed in order to prevent the Greek crisis from having a much-feared domino effect across the entire euro area: firstly, a united Greece with an economic and budgetary recovery plan; secondly, a European Union and a Euro Group which are united by the same objective; thirdly, a little more time than initially planned, particularly for privatisations; and fourthly, solidarity which is properly understood and which comprises not only new loans, but also, and above all, technical assistance from its partners, and in particular from the Commission."
"(PT) Mr President, first of all I must say that I am expecting some highly responsible decision making from this European Council, particularly in view of the economic climate we have been experiencing in recent weeks."
"It must be more responsible than the last Council, which tried to put a problem off for three months merely because of electoral timetables."
"What I expect from this responsible decision making is essentially for people to realise that economic and financial issues are crucial and decisive for Europe, but that they are instrumental for Europe's primary purpose, which is to keep the peace."
"If we take an approach to problems that only leads to the Member States beginning to mistrust each other, to sowing mistrust between the various states, to creating and exacerbating differences and rivalries between southern and northern states and between central and peripheral states, the end result will be the decline of the European Union."
"I believe that what is at stake in this European Council, regardless of the technical solutions or political disagreements, is knowing whether or not we want the European project to continue to be a valid blueprint for a strategy for peace in Europe."
"I believe that is what is at stake."
"What I notice in the speeches of many leaders, whether they are in countries in difficulties or countries that pay out and are net contributors, is an irresponsible discourse that often even appeals to certain extremely negative features of their nationalities."
"For that reason, and that reason alone, I appeal to the sense of responsibility of European government leaders to come up with solutions that enable Europe to find a way out and to resolve the situation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, mutual fear and mistrust - as Mr Mauro was saying just now - are guiding the decisions made by European governments on the crisis."
"Europe looks to me like a football team that is losing 2-0 whose players think they can recover by not passing the ball any more and trying to score alone."
"No match can be won by playing alone, however."
"Not even Maradona or Pelé could win the match of this crisis by themselves."
"The Greek crisis could have been controlled in its early stages."
"Instead, we pressed on and have now reached a very tricky point, which must be tackled by leaving damaging jealousies and failed economic recipes behind once and for all."
"We should tell the truth and admit that many of today's heads of government are proving to be second-rate leaders."
"They cannot understand that the crisis was certainly not caused by Greece or even by the sovereign debt situation, but by the financial markets, which until the other day were unregulated."
"Now the governments are again offering us the usual poisoned bait: let us sort out our public accounts and then we will see who is left alive."
"Nobody will be left alive, however, and above all the vital part of European society will not be left alive."
"Instead, we need to aim for growth by aiming and focusing resources on research, training and the major challenges, and starting a virtuous circle."
"Lastly, we should speak plainly about immigration."
"Schengen should not be touched; at most it can be strengthened, but it should not be touched because it is an inalienable achievement that keeps the European Union standing."
"Migrant flows must be governed from Brussels in a way that rewards inclusion, solidarity and security."
"(RO) Mr President, the Council will bring the Hungarian Presidency to an end."
"The efforts of this Presidency should be commended for completing important dossiers, including some extremely controversial ones."
"This is a very important meeting because it will be seen whether the European semester is going to be implemented."
"The recommendations must be applied by Member States to prevent stability being jeopardised."
"Now is the time when Member States need to prove their responsible commitment to abiding by the new mechanism."
"Stability or convergence programmes and domestic reform programmes are needed, but are not enough."
"Agreement must be reached on the meaning of economic governance."
"Parliament has achieved a compromise with great effort, which I hope will be supported by the vote tomorrow."
"It is the Council's turn to adopt this package of paramount importance to the Union."
"The Schengen area has been a major talking point recently."
"The evaluation mechanism obviously needs to be revamped."
"Reintroducing borders unilaterally is not a solution."
"If a Member State is unable to meet its external border responsibilities, support measures and the involvement of Frontex are required."
"If the situation is not resolved, the Council, at the Commission's suggestion, can decide by qualified majority to reintroduce border controls for a limited period."
"I believe that introducing borders unilaterally, as is happening at the moment, is not a solution."
"Approval of the Presidency's report on the means for promoting Roma inclusion in the European Union and of the conclusions concerning the launch of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region may mark important steps in the implementation of these vital policies for the European Union."
"Mr President, the weakness of the Stability Pact has been one factor in this deepening economic crisis, which has grown into a credibility crisis."
"Nobody is blameless in this respect."
"We have now reached an emergency situation where solidarity and responsibility are all that count, but solidarity does not just mean all for one."
"In exactly the same way it means one for all."
"Every Member State has to take responsibility for the ownership of our Union and start acting for the common good of Europe."
"We do need more Europe, and more Europe means more discipline, including concrete measures against those who continue to violate the rules."
"To restore the euro zone's credibility, the Commission's role has to be to become both stronger and more independent in exercising economic governance and conducting surveillance."
"The Commission needs a mandate to assess the economic situation in the Member States, so it can issue recommendations and warnings in time."
"But the crucial issue will be the political will and ability to apply fines."
"Their application should become a rule, not an object of political bargaining."
"The role of the Council should be duly limited, in procedures that lead to potential sanctions."
"The EU's credibility can be restored by improving the quality of statistics, excluding in the future any manipulation and falsifying of fiscal data."
"My country, Estonia, faced a deep economic crisis three years ago."
"However, we acted, balanced the budget and entered the euro zone."
"Latvia acted too and is clearly back on track."
"All for one and one for all."
"We all have to act in reforming our societies."
"Cutting expenses hurts, but remains the only way back to growth and stability."
"Mr President, we have heard a lot today about giving and giving and giving and cutting and cutting and cutting."
"I want to add another dimension to the mix, and that is 'taking and taking and taking'."
"I am referring in particular to the interest rate being charged by the ECB to my own country, Ireland."
"We are struggling manfully to reach our targets in relation to the bail-out. But this is not helping us."
"Thankfully, the EP and the Commission see that we are being unjustly and unfairly treated."
"Charging an interest rate like the one we are being charged is akin to tying a millstone around the neck of a drowning man while you are sending out the lifeboat to save him."
"I would ask, particularly tomorrow, for the Council to reduce the interest rate on Ireland."
"If it does so, we will return to growth, we will meet our commitments and we will be a great nation, part of Europe once again."
"(HU) Mr President, the European Council will hopefully endorse the three successful objectives of the Hungarian Presidency: the Danube strategy, the Roma strategy and the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia."
"The key objective, however, would be the adoption of the 'six-pack,' the legislative package on economic governance."
"Hungarian experts and diplomats deserve the highest praise for their great work, because they managed to reduce the number of issues between the Council and the European Parliament to only a few."
"In order to break the deadlock of the negotiations, the Hungarian Government needs to achieve compromises at the highest possible level."
"Whether the government of Viktor Orbán has enough political capital to do so, however, is still in question."
"Is Mr Matolcsy, who had openly and harshly attacked the European semester before, able to argue credibly in favour of strengthening economic governance?"
"I hope that we can still reach a breakthrough in the Council."
"Europe needs the introduction of economic governance as soon as possible."
"(PT) Mr President, what the serious economic and social situation affecting several Member States of the Union deserves from this forthcoming June European Council is very careful consideration, deep reflection on its causes, and acceptance of responsibility for the increasingly neoliberal Union policies, such as privatisations and the devaluing of labour, which are causing more social inequality, greater economic divergence, and more unemployment, poverty and social exclusion."
"The Council members are indifferent to the struggle of workers and ordinary people and, unfortunately, what they are proposing is to make permanent the neoliberal policies that have already led to serious crises in Greece and Ireland and are threatening Portugal and other Member States."
"In the end, what they are trying to do is to make it easier to gain more profit from capital and from greater financial speculation, and always at the expense of the same groups as ever: workers, micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, farmers and people affected by these investment cuts and austerity policies."
"(DE) Mr President, the EU's current migration policy has failed."
"An example of this is the Commission's plans for so-called mobility partnerships in order to give the mass influx of people from North Africa a semblance of legality."
"Mrs Malmström has declared many times that Europe is allegedly dependent on immigration from North Africa."
"However, the fact that many Member States are having to deal with high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, is deliberately ignored."
"In Libya, the population has doubled in the last 20 years."
"Thus, if the gates to North Africa were opened, the pressure on the European labour market would increase further."
"Therefore, we do not need more immigration from North Africa, but rather a stop to immigration altogether."
"Our citizens do not want mobility partnerships in this regard; instead they want readmission partnerships."
"Our fellow citizens do not want open borders, but rather the reintroduction of controls and a strengthening of Frontex."
"This also ought to be considered at the forthcoming Council meeting when 'progress' in immigration policy is discussed."
"(PL) Mr President, we have spent most of our time discussing the crisis in Greece, and quite rightly so, for it is an enormous problem."
"Yet during yesterday's debate, Mr Barroso also asked us for our support on the Schengen issue."
"The fact that Mr Barroso has asked us in Parliament for our support means that he must be anticipating a very difficult situation, and difficult talks with the heads of the various governments."
"I would like to say that the Schengen area, and the freedom it brings to travel around Europe, was a symbol of freedom and of the European Union, and one of the chief assets and greatest merits of the European Union, for me personally, as a Pole, and for all Polish people."
"We cannot allow this freedom to be limited, or for the Schengen area to disintegrate, for it is precisely decisions and policies of this kind that determine how the EU is perceived."
"Therefore I would call not only for the Schengen system to be defended, but also for Romania and Bulgaria to be included, or rather involved in this system as soon as possible."
"(PL) Mr President, it has given me great satisfaction during today's debate to see the two camps which have emerged in respect of the reasons behind this state of affairs and the recommendations; the neo-liberals on one side, and the left-wing Members on the other."
"It is apparent that after so many months of debates on the situation in Europe, we have come to the conclusion firstly that there is a very high level of threat, and secondly that cooperation is necessary."
"In connection with this, I was happy to hear Mr Barroso say today that a proposal will be submitted regarding a tax on financial transactions."
"I am pleased that this is the case."
"It is a shame that we are not already working with a final draft, but the fact that a draft exists is very much to be welcomed."
"If I may, I should like to emphasise one more matter: for the time being we are focusing on the euro area, but we also have a 'non-euro area' in the European Union, and we should ensure that this does not experience problems either."
"(MT) Mr President, on the immigration issue, we expect three things tomorrow."
"Firstly, that the Schengen Area is defended because it represents freedom for our citizens and constitutes one of the most visible elements for European Union citizens."
"Secondly, we expect shared responsibility on the external borders too, not just on the internal ones."
"This will require a stronger Frontex Agency, as well as increased solidarity and the parcelling out of responsibilities in a fair and just manner."
"It will also necessitate greater cooperation with the Southern Mediterranean countries that have undergone revolutions."
"Above all, what we need most of all tomorrow is true political will."
"If this is lacking then we will never practise what we preach."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, today's lively and animated debate is clear proof that the agenda of the European Council is highly relevant and critically important for the future of Europe."
"Greece was very much present in most of our interventions."
"We know that the situation in Greece is very difficult and that there are no easy solutions."
"I agree with all of you who said that it is very important to demonstrate to the Greek people that it is not only about cuts and austerity, but that there is also light at the end of the tunnel and that we can actually help Greece to get back onto the path of growth."
"Austerity must therefore be accompanied by pro-growth policies and measures."
"I am absolutely sure that the European Union and the Commission can do that."
"We can help Greece to increase administrative capacity."
"We can help Greece to absorb structural funds better and put them in strategic pro-growth sectors, and we can help the Greek authorities to improve the quality of their tax collection."
"We know how to help countries improve their educational systems."
"I think we can all do it now, and the Commission is ready to proceed in that way."
"We are prepared to put together technical assistance programmes which will accompany the difficult austerity measures the Greek authorities have to go through."
"By this, we would like to show clearly that Europe cares;"
"Europe is solidarity and Europe can help if the country is in such distress."
"However, the same message needs to come from the Greek political establishment."
"We can do our best, but what we need from the Greek authorities is a clear show of unity, and a clear show of resolve to tackle the difficult issues in that country."
"This would be my appeal and the appeal of the Commission to the Greek political representatives: cooperate, show us unity, show us a united approach to the very difficult issues."
"The time is right and this would be a highly responsible gesture."
"Not many of you touched upon the very important element of the conclusion of the European semester."
"However, I will mention it here because we need the help of the members of the European Parliament to go back to their constituencies and explain that the European semester is over and national semesters are starting."
"I think we know what to do; we have country-specific recommendations which are very fair, very honest and very detailed for each Member State, but now we need the cooperation of the national authorities and of the national governments to actually deliver and to carry out the reforms in the Member States."
"Only by this will we change the quality and competitiveness of the European economy for the better and put the European economy on new wheels."
"I would like to confirm once again that a financial transaction tax will be proposed by the European Commission."
"We needed to carry out a very thorough impact assessment and that is about to be concluded."
"This will be one of our proposals, and one of our inputs into the global debate on these very important issues."
"Again, Europe will provide leadership on this issue and we hope that our global partners will follow."
"Several of you referred to the Schengen area and to the importance of having high quality immigration policies in place."
"I would like to assure you that we are absolutely aware of the fact that freedom and the rights of persons to free movement within Europe is one of the most important achievements, and we should treasure it."
"The Commission will act as the guardian of the treaties and would be ready to act if the basic foundations of these projects are called into question."
"After recent developments, we also have to acknowledge that we need a complex solution for all aspects of migration and that we need to consolidate trust in the system."
"Therefore, the Commission is convinced that only a coordinated and Community-based process is adequate as opposed to unilateral initiatives by Member States to re-introduce internal border controls."
"We also need a common European Asylum System that is more efficient and more protective."
"We will do our utmost to ensure that the system is up and running by 2012."
"This is the Commission's approach and I hope that it will be supported by the European Parliament and by the Member States."
"Please allow me a few short words on economic governance and the 'six pack'."
"You have already heard the position of the Commission President and you will have a chance to discuss this issue in greater detail with my fellow Commissioner, Olli Rehn."
"I would underline only one element and that is the importance of having an agreement sooner rather than later, because time is pressing and we need our new tools in order to govern European economies in better and more reliable ways in the future."
"A concluding remark on Croatia."
"I think that it is time and it is appropriate to congratulate Croatia, because it is approaching a historical moment and I believe that this should give a very positive signal, not only for all Croatians, but for all the peoples of the western Balkans."
"I would also like to congratulate the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which did an excellent job of pushing this so far forward, enabling us to have these very good results at this time."
"The last word of thanks goes to Ms Enikő Győri."
"She said many times that she wanted to lead a parliament-friendly Presidency."
"I think she has proved it with her frequent presence in this House."
"I would also like to thank her for her excellent cooperation with the Commission."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me use my mother tongue this last time that I participate in the plenary session."
"First of all, I would like to thank you all for recognising our work, as we could hear many MEPs from various groups conclude that the Hungarian Presidency did a good job."
"I personally believe that it is indeed worth leading a Parliament-friendly Presidency in the European Union."
"President Barroso alluded to the 'six-pack,' and Vice-President Šefčovič mentioned the negotiations with Croatia and the different dossiers."
"The existence of the co-decision procedure in the European Union gives the Council and the Presidency the opportunity to build personal relations with a large number of Members, and to raise mutual awareness within the institutions of each other's problems, which I believe is a great opportunity for us all."
"Thank you for organising this debate today."
"I believe that we agree on the fundamental principles and basic values, of which much has been said today, and even European integration philosophies have been discussed, and I have to say that most of the Members' speeches reflected this agreement between us."
"We also agree that the European Council has to tackle extremely difficult issues today."
"I would be more careful when using the word 'historical', because I think we depreciate the concept if we use it too often."
"I strongly agree that fear and mistrust are bad counsellors, and EU leaders should not be led by these emotions during the meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow."
"It is my credo, and that of the Hungarian Presidency as well, that we have to base all our steps on trust - and I would even say mutual trust -, on taking responsibility and on solidarity, just like you have urged us."
"Whether it be about economic policy, Schengen reforms, asylum or enlargement, this is what we must build on."
"The solution - as proposed by the great majority - is more Europe, a stronger Europe; the Hungarian Presidency has been working for the last six months with this in mind."
"It is indeed our firm belief that deeper integration is the solution to our common problems."
"Finally, I would like to report on the issues which were given to the Hungarian Presidency as homework by the previous European Councils, and more specifically: what results and achievements will be presented at the summit starting tomorrow, because, after all, we had to make a deal about specific dossiers with you and we had to reach agreement on other issues as well."
"Let me start with economic issues."
"We have already talked about the European semester, and I would like to thank Vice-President Šefčovič, because it is really worth informing the public about what the semester means."
"It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member States manage themselves, so that we may send them warning signals in time."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament followed this practice with close attention; in this European semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter budgetary management, and, at the same time, we lay down the basis for the practice of seeking growth in hard work and creativity."
"As far as the 'six-pack' is concerned, there will be an in-depth debate on it soon in this House."
"Let me give you two reasons why I would prefer the adoption of the current agreement."
"Firstly, because this package is good."
"It is better than the initial Council proposal, and because Parliament was given concessions by the Council on every single issue on its agenda."
"We have even achieved concessions on reverse qualified majority voting."
"So, I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff's opinion that the whole package has only one tooth, namely reverse QMV."
"The advantage of this package is indeed that it builds several checks and balances into the system, through which crises like the one of 2008 can be avoided in the future."
"As far as free movement of persons is concerned, let me tell you that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 June the Hungarian Presidency unanimously adopted a conclusion stating that free movement has to be preserved, that we need to revise the measures already available to us, and only after we have exhausted them and only if new problems actually arise, requiring the adjustment of our current acquis, can we take extraordinary measures in extraordinary situations, and that the modalities should only be elaborated once there is a concrete legislative proposal at hand, which, as far as I know, will happen this autumn."
"I have just received news that parallel to this plenary session the Council agreed on the only open question regarding Frontex, so the negotiations on the strengthening of Frontex have been concluded with success."
"I thank Parliament for their cooperation."
"The other homework given by the European Council was to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank, and in this regard we were able to come to an agreement with this Parliament, which is another success we achieved, and I believe this was an important step towards the reconciliation of the situation in the countries of North Africa."
"As a quick side note, I must respond to the words of Mr Tabajdi."
"I must reject his remarks concerning the members of the Hungarian Government, which I think are based on domestic political motivations."
"First, I would like to ask you to inquire from your colleagues in the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the work of Minister for National Economy György Matolcsy, because the atmosphere in the hearing yesterday was slightly different from what you have talked about here today."
"I would also recommend that you read the responses of the Member States to the Commission's proposals concerning the European semester."
"Everyone is free to react and criticise the content, because everything works out through debates and interchanges of opinions in the European Union, and it is true that many Member States have criticised the content already."
"Second, I would like to point out to you one of the positive traits of the Hungarian Presidency, the key to our success in reaching agreements with European institutions on so many issues, namely respect for the Treaties and for the competence of the institutions."
"We submit the 'six-pack' to the Council in the knowledge that the Hungarian Presidency has done everything it could to come to an agreement, as praised by President Barroso and by your colleagues in this House in committee meetings."
"Therefore, we now submit the package to the European Council, whose President's name is Herman Van Rompuy, and who will decide on a course of action."
"Last but not least, I would like to talk about the accession of Croatia."
"As I said at the beginning, I am careful with the use of the word 'historical'."
"However, in the case of Croatia I think we have indeed come to a historical moment, because we are sending a very important message to the Western Balkans, namely that they have a future in the European Union."
"I truly hope that the heads of EU Member States and governments will take the political decision tomorrow and the day after tomorrow about the accession of Croatia, and that the negotiations can be concluded in the final hours of the Hungarian Presidency, on 30 June at the latest."
"The European Commission worked around the clock to be able to issue a positive report on 10 June."
"I can assure you that both the Croatians and the Hungarian Presidency have been working day and night to make this happen."
"We have had Council working group meetings every day to enable us to complete the work."
"Finally, I would like to thank not only this House - which I have done already - but also our partners in the trio, Spain and Belgium, for their excellent cooperation and for the fact that we were able to complete the 18-month trio programme, and may I wish Poland all the best and a Parliament-friendly Presidency."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"The forthcoming European Council is of particular importance because the two great facets of European integration will be at the heart of the debates."
"The first is economic integration in the shape of the economic governance package, which should make it possible to find the best solutions for getting out of the economic and financial crisis, as well as concrete measures for the countries in especially difficult economic situations; to this end the Council should send out a clear message of solidarity and responsibility."
"Secondly, this period of troubles and great migratory pressures that we are experiencing cannot serve as an excuse for weakening the great success of Schengen, a synonym for freedom of movement."
"We cannot do a U-turn on this success, but instead we must protect, strengthen and develop it."
"I hope this Council sends out a strong, clear message to this effect, emphasising that the Member States need to respect and implement the Schengen rules properly and effectively."
"It must draw attention to the need to improve solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities among Member States, and to increase the powers and resources of Frontex."
"It must also stress the need to set up a real evaluation mechanism for Schengen that will check compliance with the rules and border controls, identify problems, help solve them and, as a last resort, penalise Member States if they persist in not complying."
"The dramatic effects of the so-called austerity measures are highly visible."
"As many people warned a year ago, the International Monetary Fund-European Union (IMF-EU) programme for Greece has not only caused economic disaster and social devastation, but it has proved incapable of fulfilling the very objectives that allegedly justified it: the deficit reduction targets have not been met, the country's public debt must be around 170% at the moment and the interest rates that the markets require on the public debt have soared."
"Nonetheless, the European Council is preparing a fresh assault."
"In addition to the identically tailored IMF-EU programmes that they want to implement in Ireland and now Portugal, they are preparing to reinforce the attack on Greece, squeezing its people even further."
"These are the latest steps in this process of interference and extortion, which is openly colonial in complexion."
"They intend to use economic governance to institutionalise and make permanent the interventionist policies and measures associated with current, ongoing examples of IMF-EU meddling."
"They want 'cross-compliance' to become permanent, as well as external control over national accounts and policies, which are closely supervised by the major EU powers. Infringement (or even a mere threat of infringement) of their dictates would result in heavy penalties."
"These are unacceptable developments that show how retrograde, reactionary and anti-democratic this European Union really is."
"We are at a crucial moment, when Europe's economic future is being decided in the shape of the economic governance package."
"Furthermore, in several days' time the EU will decide on the next tranche of economic aid for Greece."
"In my opinion, if we are to exit the crisis then we need greater economic integration within Europe, not additional sanctions or restrictions."
"Today's European Union comprises both the euro area and the remaining countries, and while the euro area itself admittedly shares one currency, it is also made up of 17 bond markets and 17 governments' development strategies."
"My political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is therefore in favour of adopting positive solutions, such as closer economic integration."
"We also believe that the burden should fall on those who are responsible for the economic crisis, hence the idea of a tax on financial transactions, and not those who are its victims, for example the citizens of Greece."
"The current European Council meeting is also the last during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, which has not earned the praise that should be due to it, since a number of concrete projects on the EU's agenda upon which the Hungarians have worked, including those concerning economic governance, have been overshadowed by political issues, such as the media law or the Hungarian constitution."
"I hope that Poland, which is next in line to take over the presidency, will not follow the example of our neighbours, and that the election campaign for the Sejm will not overshadow its successes."
"I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be."
"It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies, and the consequences of the Arab revolutions, at Europe's borders."
"If we have chosen to seize this opportunity in order to strengthen external border checks, then it should be said straight away that we have picked the wrong target again."
"It is not enough simply to pursue a repressive policy which we know is ineffective and causes great human suffering."
"Let us remember that there are people in need of protection at Europe's doors, doors which remain closed to them under the false pretexts of cost and abuse."
"Following the recent World Refugee Day, let us insist, above all, on our responsibilities as Europeans, responsibilities which the Member States are, wrongly, afraid to shoulder."
"Otherwise the 2012 deadline, to which those same Member States have committed themselves, may well be missed."
"in writing. - We are preparing for a busy European Council meeting which will, in my opinion, be even of historic importance."
"The Hungarian Presidency has some important success stories under its belt: the Danube strategy and the adoption of the Roma strategy."
"However, I do hope that after the good quality work they have done on a professional level, they will have enough political weight and agility to reach important goals in other areas, such as the Croatian accession, migration and the very pressing issue of economic governance."
"They have to work hard to achieve an understanding between 27 Member States, to reflect Europe's unity and willingness to overcome the crisis and preserve the essence of European integration."
"I am impressed that my country's first EU Presidency happens to be during such a challenging period and I hope that the European Council this week will live up to the expectations."
"in writing. - (DE) Whereas the immigration world champion Canada attracts more highly qualified migrants than any other region of the world - in which regard, those who are not able to make a living are also quick to leave again - Europe almost pursues a policy of 'compassionate migration for the unqualified'."
"The fact is that the majority of Africans who come to Europe are not refugees, they are economic migrants."
"This human horse trading under the false heading of 'refugees' as well as the humanitarian call for asylum is causing irreparable damage to the asylum system."
"A European asylum policy is doomed to failure on account of the undesirable side effects of previous proposals: the Dublin Regulation was intended to prevent asylum tourism."
"Now, countries with easily accessible external borders are swamped, but the majority of asylum seekers nevertheless are landing in the countries with the most generous social security systems."
"The fact that granting asylum seekers equality with the national population in terms of access to the labour market and social security has boosted economic migration was only to be expected."
"The increased rights of illegal immigrants make deportation almost impossible."
"A uniform asylum law would only be desirable if it was based on the most stringent national asylum law, like that of Denmark for example, and if there were consequences for contraventions of the law, like the tourist visa for illegal immigrants."
"A European asylum system based on the central principles of humanitarianism and muddling through is to be firmly rejected."
"There must finally be a clear differentiation between refugees with a right to asylum and economic migrants."
"Moreover, Frontex and readmission agreements must be developed further and illegal immigrants must consistently be deported."
"In view of the European Council meeting on 23-24 June, I would like to raise the issue of Croatia's accession."
"I would first of all like to say how pleased I am that my position, supported by an amendment to the resolution on the 2010 progress report for Croatia, tabled along with my colleague Bernd Posselt, is in the process of becoming a reality."
"This is why I welcome the agreement reached within the General Affairs Council on concluding negotiations with Croatia by the end of this month."
"I hope that the European Council will formalise this matter."
"After six years of negotiations, the time has come for recognition to be given to Croatia's efforts in meeting the accession criteria."
"I hope that in 2013 we can welcome Croatia as the 28th Member State."
"The Council's decision will send an extremely strong signal to the Western Balkans as a whole, encouraging the governments in this region to continue their reforms."
"This is a long process which requires sacrifices to be made. However, the integration efforts are rewarded in the end."
"At the same time, I welcome the positive attitude shown by the Croatian authorities to the use of the monitoring mechanism up until the actual time of accession as an additional incentive."
"However, there should be no option for extending its use after this date."
"The Schengen area will be one of the issues discussed at the Council's forthcoming meeting."
"In this context, I would like to draw the House's attention to the ever-increasing number of people talking about the reintroduction of border checks."
"Denmark was planning to take a decision to this effect."
"The reasons given, namely the fight against cross-border crime and the increase in illegal immigration, are very serious problems, but they cannot be solved by closing the borders."
"This course of action runs counter to EU regulations on the free movement of goods and services."
"It will also result in a rise in xenophobia and a growth in the influence of parties proclaiming populist and nationalist slogans."
"What we need most of all is joint and more effective solutions for protecting the EU's external borders and uniform standards for all Member States as far as immigration policy is concerned."
"In this context, I would call on the European Commission either to uphold its resolute opposition to a reintroduction of border checks or to establish joint, uniform and reasonable rules, criteria and mechanisms for a possible reintroduction."
"in writing. - (RO) First of all, I share the sentiments of my fellow Members maintaining that we should show solidarity with Greece."
"The European Union must take a firm, united stance on this decision."
"Secondly, the Schengen area is one of the EU's biggest achievements, the principles of which must be observed and defended."
"In this context, I think that restoring border controls within the Schengen area is not acceptable, nor is the introduction of additional criteria for Member States which would like to join the Schengen area and fulfil the specific technical criteria."
"Thirdly, I welcome the European Council's adoption of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region."
"There is a long history of cooperation in the Danube region."
"One of the first European institutions, the European Danube Commission, was founded in 1856, with its headquarters in Galaţi, in Romania, its aim being to ensure freedom of navigation on the Danube."
"I call on the relevant Member States to give priority to the implementation of this strategy, thereby ensuring economic and social development for more than 120 million citizens living in this macro-region."
"Finally, I call on the European Council and Member States to remove the current barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers."
"Lifting these barriers means respect for the EU's fundamental principles such as the free movement of persons and solidarity."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Council has a few things planned for the agenda of its meeting."
"With regard to the Greek crisis, it is finally to be made clear that the European Union does not just stand for 'give' or 'take' but that it works on the principle of 'give and take'."
"However, that also means that if a country receives help, this country must also follow the measures that are put in place for this purpose."
"The improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact is very much to be welcomed, simply to prevent any further financial disasters being experienced by a Member State."
"With regard to the planned accession of Croatia, the fact that Croatia fulfils the accession criteria is something to be welcomed, but it nevertheless has to be asked how the funding of approximately EUR 500 million to which Croatia is entitled is actually to be financed."
"The CAP towards 2020: Meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Dess, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1961, I began my training to be a farmer."
"Ever since then, I have been guided by the common European agricultural policy."
"It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process."
"Since the beginning of the CAP there have been fundamental changes to its tasks."
"The first task was to increase food production in order for us to be less dependent on food imports."
"Sometime later, Europe was in the position of having to deal with food surpluses."
"With an ever-changing situation, there were also more and more reforms."
"Today, we are debating the next reform, the new approach of the CAP after 2013."
"As rapporteur for the CAP reform towards 2020, I am pleased that we have achieved a cross-group compromise."
"Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"The clear vote is an unambiguous signal to the Commission of the form that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sees the CAP taking towards 2020."
"I am certain, Commissioner, that the new approach of the CAP after 2013 will also bear the stamp of the European Parliament."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives us that possibility."
"My thanks today go to my fellow Members for their involvement and support, and to the committee chair Mr De Castro, the coordinators and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and willingness to compromise."
"I would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat, the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation."
"Turning to the report now: food safety and the security of supply for half a billion people remain the main goals of the common agricultural policy, not only in the EU, but also worldwide."
"The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive, to supply consumers with safe, high-quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy."
"The two-pillar structure of the CAP is to remain so as to create certainty of planning for our farmers for this next period."
"The report clearly states - and here we support the Commissioner - that the agricultural budget should remain at the current level in the next financial period."
"I cannot understand President Barroso's statement that massive cuts are to be made in the second pillar."
"I believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this."
"The simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task. That is a core demand of our compromise."
"We are also calling for a fair distribution among the Member States."
"That is also necessary in order to create a level playing field in terms of competition."
"We are seeking to move away from historical and individual references towards area-based premiums."
"The role of small farmers is to be recognised and, on the basis of subsidiarity, the Member States are to decide themselves how to support these small farmers."
"The importance of young farmers is mentioned."
"From my point of view, it was important to avoid introducing a new additional payment system that would lead to extra control and sanction systems for greening."
"Overall, we have found a compromise that many Members will be able to support tomorrow so that we can send out a clear signal as regards the new approach of this agricultural policy."
"A large majority of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will support this report."
"Mr President, Mr Dess, honourable Members, this report has come at a pivotal time, just as the Commission is drafting detailed legislative proposals that it plans to present to Parliament and the Council in October."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, for his work over past weeks and months."
"I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their hard work and the fruitful discussions that we have had since I began the task of preparing the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Many elements in the report are in line with the Commission's vision as set out in the communication on reforming the common agricultural policy, which was presented at the end of 2010 and was intended to spark debate."
"I am thinking in particular of the question of food security, which is one of agriculture's underlying aims."
"I am also thinking of the importance of preserving the two pillars of the common agricultural policy, as Mr Dess has just said, whilst also recognising the need to make the policy greener and to focus more on integrating the sound management of natural resources."
"I am also referring to a fairer distribution of common agricultural policy money between European farmers and to the need for a budget that is able to address food and regional issues, but also the management of natural resources in the European Union."
"I also note that you have included a proposal for higher ceilings for direct payments."
"At this stage, let me stress the considerable contribution that many large farms make to rural employment."
"Criteria such as employment will therefore be taken into account when we define the ceilings for agricultural income aid."
"Adding a green component to the first pillar in conjunction with a stronger rural development policy is another key objective that will help to tackle climate change and environmental issues, but will also contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I am pleased to see that the report stresses the importance of closer links between direct payments and conservation of natural resources."
"I want to establish an effective, pan-European instrument that achieves the objective of simplifying the direct payment system."
"I am a strong advocate of decoupling direct payments, which has proved beneficial in helping farmers to adapt better to market conditions."
"However, I share the view expressed in your report, namely that we need to be practical and realistic."
"In certain situations, specific segments and sectors that are economically, ecologically and socially sensitive, I feel that optional coupled aid should also be available."
"Direct payments will continue to play an important role in maintaining regional vitality."
"This is a particular challenge in areas with significant natural limitations."
"That is why the Commission communication stressed the value of providing income aid in addition to the second pillar payments made to areas with natural constraints, which will continue to be awarded."
"We will examine the concerns expressed in your report, which suggests that this component should not be included under the first pillar."
"In the communication on the future of the common agricultural policy, I suggested creating a specific support scheme for small farmers, which would help them by minimising the administrative red tape associated with direct aid."
"Under the second pillar, small farmers could also receive significant support for restructuring or to allow them to contribute more at a territorial level, but also in economic terms, by becoming more profitable and more competitive."
"Limiting direct payments to active farmers is another point on which your expectations and my vision of the future common agricultural policy coincide."
"Here again, we want to establish a European definition that can also allow for the specific conditions in Member States."
"I have also paid close attention to your proposals on market measures."
"Strengthening management capacity and the negotiating power of producers and producer organisations, transparent pricing and other risk-management measures are all subjects that I am committed to examining in detail as part of the impact assessment."
"I intend to develop specific legislative proposals on these points."
"I agree with your comments on improving and enhancing rural development measures."
"I also agree that we need measures that will allow us to respond more effectively to challenges associated with global warming, biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources."
"The second pillar of the future common agricultural policy will have to address all these challenges and will also have to consider how technical knowledge can be used to build a future that combines competitiveness and environmental concerns."
"I can tell you that the entire Commission - the full College of Commissioners, including President Barroso - is in favour of a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy."
"I was interested to read your proposals regarding young farmers."
"Rural development policy must provide a wide range of support measures that will meet their needs."
"I would also like to consider what could be done under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy for young farmers."
"In future, I would like Member States to be able to define thematic sub-programmes: packages of measures which specifically target young farmers and recognise that they are a priority group in the Member State."
"I am thinking of measures for setting up, vocational training, training services, investing in modernisation and restructuring farms."
"As you emphasise in your report, our policy will need adequate funding if it is to address future challenges."
"We are currently waiting for the Commission communication on the next multiannual financial framework, which will be published by the end of June."
"We will build on that communication when we present our impact assessment and legislative proposals in the autumn, as I said."
"Thank you once again for this report."
"I am happy to answer any questions."
"I hope that this will be a very productive discussion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating the common agricultural policy."
"A lot of people criticise the common agricultural policy, because they believe that it has caused environmental damage and has in the past and even today continues to put developing countries at risk on numerous counts, especially in terms of agriculture and development."
"Those who levy this criticism are right, but those calling for a reduction in funding for the common agricultural policy are wrong."
"The common agricultural policy is not just a policy for agriculture; it is an instrument for redistributing resources from the towns of Europe to the countryside."
"It is the European citizens in the countryside who take care of our forests, rivers and lakes and who give us food, clean air and water."
"We need to provide incentives for them to make changes where changes are needed."
"However, if we want to apply serious policy, we should increase funding for our agricultural policy, for a fairer, more effective and more viable common agricultural policy."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to ask European citizens what they expect from European politics they would answer quality of life, using terms like health and environment."
"With this common agricultural policy, we are facing precisely this task of fulfilling these expectations of European citizens in us as politicians, but also in politics in general."
"The contribution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is an important one in this context, because we want the same things European citizens do."
"We want wholesome food produced in a diverse system, and by diverse I do mean biological diversity, but also diversity in terms of production."
"We must enable the preservation of the environment in which we live."
"We need to take care of our water bodies, the air and the soil."
"We need to ensure that the rural habitat continues to be developed and does not become the poorhouse of Europe."
"We need to pursue an agricultural policy that involves the development of all regions."
"We need money for this and we need the money to be properly and fairly distributed."
"Mr President, my apologies!"
"Please start timing."
"I wish to present a number of comments from the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development."
"It is a shame that they were not fully incorporated into the report of the Committee on Agriculture."
"They are as follows."
"Food security at EU and global level and globalisation necessitate a new and strong common agricultural policy, which will firstly improve our competitiveness on the international market, secondly ensure a fair income for farmers, thirdly ensure that consumers can buy high-quality products at fair prices, fourthly ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and fifthly help to improve the state of the environment."
"In order to accomplish these tasks, objective, transparent and simplified criteria need to be established, which guarantee equal support for farmers in all Member States under the direct payments system."
"It is time to move away from the use of historical payments."
"The CAP should incorporate measures for regulation of and intervention in the agricultural market, and a risk management mechanism."
"Finally, the CAP should pay more attention to small, family-owned agricultural holdings, given the need for diversification to..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text."
"In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow."
"Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament's views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010."
"The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years."
"Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell."
"They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe's 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world."
"Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making."
"Mr Dess's report endorses a positive approach to agriculture's environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation."
"By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade."
"As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities."
"Parliament's approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world."
"Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge."
"As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period."
"I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Dess, Mr Dantin was cut off, but he was going to explain that the global food challenge is important, and it is important."
"As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission's communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe's aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security."
"That entails political commitments on market regulation, which is what is under discussion today."
"We too will have to push for this in our debates at EU level."
"At a time when there are plans to eliminate Europe's food security programme, we need to remember that food security is still a matter of solidarity and is still extremely topical in Europe: almost 30 million Europeans are currently suffering from malnutrition."
"Let us not lose sight of that fact."
"Essentially, this report sets out the broad thrust: the greening of agricultural policy."
"Of course farming needs to take a positive approach to environmental issues."
"In particular, it needs to focus on the European element and ensure that it is factored in by incorporating environmental issues into the first pillar."
"Another important point is that this compromise is the result of lengthy negotiations, in which I have always been involved, on the question of graduated support."
"At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment - I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment - and, of course, the production of public goods."
"This approach is better than continuing the debate on aid ceilings and never coming up with any solutions."
"I am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion."
"Let me conclude by saying that this report and Parliament's commitment are pointless unless the agriculture budget remains at its current level."
"That is my response to the comments made by the Commissioner and the President of the Commission on the second pillar."
"We cannot accept a budget cut."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think the world-renowned Scottish poet Rabbie Burns might have described this report as a bit of a 'cow'rin, tim'rous beastie' in its original form."
"Thankfully, through the good work that Albert Dess and all the other shadow rapporteurs have put in over the last months of negotiations, we now have a report that has some real substance and one that has many areas that we can support."
"I believe, however, that it falls short in one important area, in that it fails to answer the fundamental question asked by our taxpayers and our consumers who pay for the common agricultural policy: what are the direct decoupled payments for?"
"That is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to."
"There is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled."
"There is a link to public goods through cross-compliance, but I do not think this fundamentally answers that question."
"I believe that the report should perhaps have gone a little further in responding to that question by backing the idea of a more targeted direct payment, containing a major incentive to develop a more sustainable and competitive model of agriculture, and giving the possibility of a targeting of payments at LFA areas - the so-called greening of the direct payments, which I believe the Commissioner is very much favour of."
"If we move down that road, I believe it gives us the ability to respond to that question and explain to the public exactly what direct payments are for."
"It also negates the call for caps and ceilings to be put on aids because, if there are public goods attached to the direct payments across all the direct payments, then the bigger the farmer, the more public goods that farmer will deliver."
"So there is no need to cap them."
"I believe that the report hints at that direction and I welcome the move towards that type of model."
"I hope we can improve the report tomorrow."
"If we do so, our group will certainly be happy to support it."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, can I also take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur."
"He certainly proved during the time that negotiations were going on that he had a very big back indeed, because there were a lot of people throwing knives at him during that period."
"So he proved to be very resilient in his task, and he got there."
"The first thing I want to do is to welcome the fact that it is going to be a Pillar Two structure, because I think that is what we are all agreed on."
"I listened to the talk about greening."
"When you speak about greening it means different things to different people in different countries, including how it is applied."
"We have got to get our heads around this somehow."
"It is not a simple throw-away line that you can use in some way or other, because it is going to have a tremendous effect down the line."
"Mr Le Foll is right."
"If the money is not there at the end of the day, there is little we can do in many of these areas."
"We have got to be responsible, and we have got to be responsible as a Parliament as we move towards the legal text that the Commissioner will bring forward in the late autumn of this year."
"That is going to be a tremendous challenge for us in this Parliament."
"For the first time we are going to have a responsibility, a say, and be part of the final decision-making process."
"So from that point of view, I am opposed to the present text when it talks about capping."
"I will be supporting the amendments that have been put forward to reduce the degree."
"This is something that we have got to talk about more but, as I said, it will all be no good if the budget is not there."
"We have got to look at how we spend the money."
"Are we spending our money as wisely as we can?"
"Is there not too much of it going on administration?"
"Is there not too much going on bureaucracy and red tape?"
"And is not enough being given towards food security?"
"Again like greening, people talk about food security as a throw-away line."
"What are we doing to achieve food security?"
"We could be facing a crisis in the next nine or ten years."
"There are fewer farmers, fewer people working; this is where I think we have to concentrate in the future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, the report takes us clearly in the right direction."
"European agricultural policy needs to be fairer, and it needs to be fairer to the environment. I believe that we have achieved these objectives with the report."
"At the end of the day, European agricultural policy must meet our objectives on climate and diversity."
"This, too, is incorporated into the report."
"European agricultural policy needs to deliver environmental services."
"Then taxpayers will be prepared to pay for it."
"We need a fair distribution between farms, but also between the Member States, and we need to practise a fair trade policy towards less developed countries."
"This, too, is in the report."
"Working through nearly 1 300 amendments has been a laborious process, but in the long term we have achieved our aim of reaching a major common compromise with clearly defined objectives."
"Parliament has proved itself capable of making such policy."
"Many points could have been worded more clearly in our view, such as the terms for payments under the first pillar - crop rotation, protection of meadow land - but fine, it is now down to the Commission to flesh out the final arrangements."
"It is also important that degressivity is included."
"Large farms need to deliver more when it comes to jobs and the environment."
"This was supported by a large majority in committee."
"It is also important that the role of farmers in trade is enhanced, and it is also important that the matter of the protein deficit is addressed."
"In the long term we cannot afford to import from other countries protein crops equivalent to 30 million hectares of feed area."
"It is high time that we made a start on this."
"We are all agreed that a strong second pillar is important."
"Rural development, environmental measures and measures for less-favoured regions - there must be a clear emphasis on these."
"If Mr Barroso wishes to axe this point he will face huge opposition from Parliament."
"It is precisely here that the opportunities for rural development lie, and we cannot turn our backs on the less-favoured regions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report presented today outlines a new direction for the common agricultural policy."
"It includes graduated public funding that reflects employment and environmental considerations, the fact that agriculture produces public goods and the concept of active farmers."
"However, we have seen too many good intentions that have never improved life for working farmers."
"Let us bear in mind the scenes being acted out right now in our rural areas."
"Although the idea of a safety net is attractive, it is not enough."
"We need to return to public intervention mechanisms in order to guarantee basic prices for small and medium-sized farmers."
"Bringing together economic, social and ecological efficiencies will also put an end to the ultra-liberal free trade model that is currently destroying family farms."
"The European Union needs to strive for radical changes in the World Trade Organisation and to work more closely with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) so as to return to cooperation systems that include variable customs duties at the border."
"We also need far more research funding in Europe."
"Lastly, we need to ensure that the budget for the policy is maintained ..."
"(The speaker concluded off-microphone)"
"Mr President, we could not hear the English interpretation of the previous speech."
"I was very interested in it and, if it is not too much of a burden on the speaker, and if you can do something so we can hear it in English, I would very much appreciate it."
"Did anyone else not hear the English interpretation?"
"Perhaps it is just a local problem in the back rows."
"We are looking into the matter."
"Apparently it was a channel mix-up."
"We are working on the problem."
"Please bear with us, but I am sure the speech can be read afterwards on the web."
"We have web streaming and I am sure the interpretation will be there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank and congratulate Mr Dess on the hard work he has put in, together with all the shadow rapporteurs."
"We are particularly pleased that there are references in this report to less-favoured areas - mountainous areas are specially close to our hearts."
"We are particularly pleased that there is support for small farms, which are fundamental because they are of great importance both for protecting the land and for the quality of the products produced on them."
"We are also particularly pleased that there are substantial references to young farmers, who to some extent represent the future of agriculture."
"We should all be aware, however, that a major battle must now be fought over the budget, which is why we are appealing to you, Commissioner, as you know it better than I or anyone else here does."
"We cannot allow the common agricultural policy (CAP) to have its budget cut, because that would mean that agriculture is probably worth less in Europe."
"Clearly, if agriculture is worth less in Europe, then agricultural products and hence all our food is also worth less."
"That is not what we think, of course."
"Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to mention the issue of imports."
"As you know, imports do not of course come into the CAP, but they make up another essential piece of the jigsaw that should go alongside the CAP, because if we import cheap, poor-quality products our agriculture is bound to collapse."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Dess for a comprehensive report."
"Like other speakers, I would like to emphasise the importance of an adequate budget for the new CAP."
"I believe that it is hugely important to base our budget on the arguments around food security."
"It is estimated that, by 2050, we will need a 70% increase in global agricultural production."
"I would argue that the new CAP should aid this and keep that production within Europe."
"We should not be doing anything to hamper the food production base that we already have."
"I welcome the clear support for the two-pillar structure and I also welcome today's affirmation from the Commissioner of his support for that as well."
"However, I would have to add that I do not want to see the support for greening in Pillar One imposing further burdens and costs on our farmers."
"For that reason I would like to see flexibility at national and regional level, given the wide diversity of farm structures and land bases across the EU."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the hard work done by the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and the shadow rapporteurs - and I congratulate them all, of course - is today entering its final stage."
"A new common agricultural policy (CAP) means a lot to Europe for the future of its agriculture and the survival of vast rural areas."
"The new CAP must enable people to enjoy an adequate supply of quality food, as well as being able to sustain the production of non-marketable public assets."
"To achieve the goals indicated, there is a need for further, more effective and especially simpler instruments for farmers, together with easier access to funding and less red tape."
"We also need market instruments to combat effectively the unfortunately recurrent crises, and also instruments to prevent and insure against the risks inherent to agriculture."
"We need a CAP for young people, to whom we can entrust the agriculture of the future."
"We have decided to promote protection of biodiversity and of the countless regional and production specificities of the European Union through a rural development policy that will enhance all the natural and human potential of rural areas."
"At the same time we must seek to make farming businesses competitive."
"That is why I would like to impress on the Commission the need to include technology transfer measures in rural development."
"As approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I confirm the importance of supporting the introduction of ceilings for direct payments awarded to large economic players."
"I think the introduction of a system of degressivity of aid as the size of a holding increases above a certain threshold is necessary to avoid overcompensating larger holdings that already enjoy major economies of scale."
"I cannot avoid underlining the need for adequate financing for the CAP."
"This House cannot accept a rural development funding cut."
"(PT) Madam President, with this reform we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament want to make the common agricultural policy (CAP) fairer, more equitable and more suited to the times in which we live, when the issues of the legitimacy of aid in relation to society and of food safety and food security in the broadest sense are more relevant than ever."
"We have succeeded in seeing our main concerns included in this report."
"They include the need to maintain an adequately funded common agricultural policy for the Union."
"I must stress that we shall not agree to the withdrawal of any financial resources in order to guarantee the enforcement of the CAP."
"We want a fairer distribution of aid both among Member States and among farmers, through the introduction of a new system not linked to production but based on environmental and social criteria; that is to say, one that promotes employment."
"We must also orient the CAP towards real farmers and create a specific mechanism for small farmers."
"I am sure that with Parliament's strengthened role under the Treaty of Lisbon we will be able to translate these goals, which for now are merely theoretical, into concrete actions."
"(SV) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Dess for his excellent work."
"I would like to talk about one aspect of agricultural policy. That is the enormous challenges that humanity and the whole world are facing."
"These include the climate, biodiversity and the eutrophication of waterways. There are all sorts of examples I could give here."
"In this context, I think that we need to realise that it is farmers who manage our environment and the prerequisites for our lives and our futures on a day-to-day basis."
"It is in agriculture and forestry that we have the best tools and it is for the use of these environmental tools that farmers should be paid, and they should be paid well for this."
"I would therefore like us in future to change our thinking somewhat and move away from income subsidies, which are difficult to account for, and ensure that we pay for the job that farmers do."
"In other words, we should stop paying subsidies and start paying for the services provided."
"The most important task for agriculture is, of course, to produce food - sufficient, good-quality food - but my view is that food should be paid for on the market."
"Environmental services cannot be paid for there."
"(PL) Madam President, in many respects the Dess report is very good, but in one respect it is quite the opposite, since it rejects the idea of a fair equalisation of direct payments."
"The bizarre and absurd principle whereby more assistance is given to those who are richer and less to those who are poorer is to continue to hold sway in the agricultural sector."
"The farmers in the new Member States, and not only the farmers, are extremely worried and alarmed by these developments."
"The agricultural sector is in decline, particularly in the new Member States."
"I would ask you to look at how much land is lying fallow in Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia."
"I would call on my fellow Members from the old Member States to end this discrimination."
"Let us finally equalise direct payments fairly, and let us not create a two-speed Europe."
"I should like to address the French Members of the House in particular to remind them of the slogan of 'liberty, equality, fraternity' which adorned the banners of the French revolution."
"We have liberty, but we do not have equality, and without equality there can be no fraternity."
"Let us demand equality."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do agree that, as well as liberty and fraternity, there should be equality for farmers and the new Member States in Eastern Europe."
"I think that this report marks a huge step forward."
"It was not easy at the outset: the situation was fairly confrontational."
"However, the important thing is that we reached a consensus."
"This consensus has allowed us to maintain the broader vision, and I believe that therein lies the European Parliament's great strength."
"We have succeeded, despite the difficulties, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, and all the Members."
"The first phase is complete."
"In this document, we have reiterated the need for equality, justice and fairness for producers and regions."
"I think that is important."
"We have clearly stated and confirmed that we want to safeguard and develop small farms, that we want small farms to be taken into account because they are essential to quality and regional biodiversity."
"In my opinion, this was another fundamental point."
"The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts."
"We now need to make it a reality: only then will farming become a viable option for future generations."
"This is not a question of ideology."
"Lastly, at present, we are worried about the real budgetary threats."
"We need to come up with unequivocal responses."
"What we want now is to move into the second phase, which is obviously the legislative debate."
"Why? Because we need more than texts and lofty intentions: it is in debating legislative proposals that we will really see where we are going."
"That is essentially what we are waiting for."
"Let me close, however, by expressing my fury at Germany's attitude. It has forced us to cut food aid to Europe's poorest citizens to one-fifth of the original amount."
"That aid was part of the common agricultural policy budget."
"I want to find another way of helping our poorest citizens: the 80 million Europeans who do not have enough to eat."
"(LV) Madam President, a great job has been done, but the completed report is couched in very general terms."
"The report clearly outlines a new direction - agricultural greening."
"This could be a form of lifebelt for non-productive farmers, who could avoid having to engage in agricultural production and yet receive area payments."
"In my view, we should, when applying this report in practice, bear in mind what is missing."
"The protein problem is missing, the issue of the quality of imported food has not been incorporated, there is no mention of the problem of genetically modified crops, and land degradation issues have been insufficiently addressed."
"There is still no clear definition of such terms as 'active farmer', 'new farmer', 'fair area payments', and 'family farms'."
"Unfortunately, a great many farmers will find no answers to their problems and their questions in this report."
"In the future we must improve it."
"Madam President, whilst the term 'greening' of Pillar One may appeal to armchair farmers, it will pose major problems to heavy-land farmers who could well abandon land rather than attempt to plant it in the spring."
"Had this policy been enforced this year, it would have resulted in total crop failures."
"Proper inspection and enforcement of greening measures will also be impossible."
"To be effective, the capping of single farm payments will need to be severe."
"This will immediately motivate farmers to formally split their businesses with their spouses so that the full payment is retained on both divisions."
"Added to that, I am informed that the savings made from capping will accrue to the EU and not the Member State that actually generated the savings."
"Cultivation of GM crops should be the decision of individual Member States."
"The suggestion that no single farm payment can be received by farmers who cultivate these crops is utterly nonsensical."
"The world is short of food."
"We should be encouraging the uptake of new farming technology and not vilifying it."
"I hope the last three winters will have convinced all of you that there is no threat to us from global warming."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, how different the opinion of the increasingly outraged European citizens would be about the European Union if they found that their tax contributions were spent exclusively as public money on public interest and for the public good, proportionate to the public good produced."
"The Dess report takes this direction in connection with the agricultural assistance provided by the European Union."
"Tomorrow we will bear immense responsibility in deciding whether to adopt the ceiling, the maximum that was determined by the Dess report as a result of the hard work of those who submitted motions for amendment, for hectare-based and area-based assistance."
"I would like to ask you to follow the sense of justice of your voters and adopt this ceiling."
"Let there be a cap on public money that the green and red barons and other urban businessmen receive from the European taxpayers!"
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though today's debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy, I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP."
"Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget."
"It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow, in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained."
"I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this."
"I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond - just to give another example - to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well."
"The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear - today of all days - that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector."
"This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework."
"Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report marks the beginning of a new phase in the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform process."
"It is the result of several months' hard work by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for which I would like to thank Mr Dess and all the shadow rapporteurs and parliamentary groups."
"Today this House can give a clear opinion on the future of the common agricultural policy: it must be a robust, simple, flexible and greener CAP that takes young people and employment into account."
"That, Commissioner, is why we are worried by the news in the press today about budget cuts, especially in the second pillar."
"That would be incompatible with both the Dess report and the report on the European Union's financial perspective by Mr Garriga Polledo, which we adopted in plenary in recent weeks."
"The latter report introduced the important principle for the CAP of maintaining the current level of funding in the next financial programming period."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we would like some clarification about the news that has been circulated, and we would like to know whether as far as you are concerned there are different guidelines from what we have been told up to now."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his persistent and positive work."
"Where the future of agricultural policy after 2013 is concerned, we have to decide the direction in which we want to go."
"Do we want an agricultural sector that faces up to the challenges by acting in an innovative, modern, courageous, self-aware, responsible and independent way in the market?"
"Or do we want an agricultural sector that continues to be drip-fed by Europe and which needs its hand to be held and encouraging words from Mummy with each step it takes into the future?"
"That is the course we are currently setting."
"To cope with the challenges of the future we need to promote modern technologies in the agricultural sector instead of having endless debates on ideologies."
"If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years."
"It is too much of a strain on our farmers' finances."
"Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes."
"We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner."
"We should not care whether it produces conventionally or organically, so long as it handles resources responsibly."
"We should also not care how many animals are kept, so long as those animals are treated well."
"The important thing for us must be that we have sufficient good quality food in the future at affordable prices in Europe."
"After all, Europe is not alone in the world."
"(CS) Madam President, the day is finally approaching when a unified agricultural policy will apply in the old and new Member States, ending 10 years of discrimination against farmers from the new Member States."
"I very much welcome this development."
"I hope that no new discriminatory conditions will be imposed on farmers in the new programming period."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that the Dess report contains such a proposal."
"I am thinking primarily of support for the so-called capping of direct payments for larger agricultural undertakings."
"I regard such a course of action as discriminatory against Member States such as the Czech Republic, which, for historical reasons, have larger farms than elsewhere in the European Union."
"I therefore reject the idea of capping direct payments, since this is a move which will reduce the efficiency of agriculture throughout the European Union."
"The primary aim of agriculture has always been to produce food."
"Nowadays, however, a number of politicians, above all those from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and from the ranks of the left, want to turn farmers into biofuel manufacturers and anti-global warming warriors."
"I cannot support such developments."
"Madam President, I would echo group colleagues and other colleagues in adding my own congratulations to our rapporteur."
"This has not been an easy job for him - or indeed any of us - and the report before us has been much improved through joint working and has much to admire within it."
"I particularly like the idea of the continuation of direct payments and the explicit removal of the historical reference values in paragraph 15 and the fairer distribution between Member States, and within Member States in the regions and nations within them, in paragraph 16."
"Coming from Scotland, I am particularly glad to see a strong statement in favour of less favoured areas in paragraph 82."
"I know that farmers in Scotland - and everywhere else too - will be glad to see paragraph 44, which contains an explicit statement that cross-compliance should be risk-based and proportional."
"Commissioner, perhaps you could mention that paragraph in particular to some of your auditor colleagues."
"While there is much to admire in this report, let us be honest with ourselves and with our voters."
"Unless we have paragraph 1, all of this is pointless - and paragraph 1, where we call for a strong and sustainable CAP with a budget commensurate with the ambitious objectives, will be pointless too."
"Like other colleagues, I wish to express my own concern, not least at today's rumours that President Barroso is looking to make swingeing cuts to the budget and Pillar Two in particular."
"Commissioner, you are going to need all the allies you can get in these discussions within the Commission and with the Member States."
"We must have a CAP that is properly funded and properly ambitious for our farmers and our citizens."
"European agriculture has a great story to tell."
"Now is not the time to fall out over minutiae."
"(GA) Madam President, I welcome Mr Dess's report on reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), and I thank him for his work."
"This week's vote will reflect what the European Parliament expects to see in the legislative proposals for the CAP."
"The budget vote, which is upcoming, is also extremely important for ensuring appropriate future funding for agriculture."
"We need to see a strong and sustainable CAP - based on two pillars - which will keep farmers on the land, ensure environmental protection, promote the rural economy and provide fairness and transparency for all those who work in the food chain."
"Greening events dealing with the environment in Pillar 1 must be clear, properly designed and easy to measure, and funding for Pillar 2 must be strong and fair."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of all Europe's policies, the common agricultural policy is the one that has had to be updated the most over the years in order to cope with constant changes occurring on the economic front, including at international level."
"It has always been updated with two main goals in mind: guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources."
"The CAP reform on which we will vote tomorrow is vital if we are to continue to support the income of our farmers, as my colleagues have already mentioned."
"The aim, then, is not to reduce direct subsidies but to find a balance between such subsidies and rural development, so that the system is rendered simpler and fairer, without the rules of competition being called into question."
"As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States."
"(EL) Madam President, we obviously need a strong CAP."
"The agricultural sector provides clear added value to the European economy."
"It plays a multifunctional role, by contributing to the production of public goods for the benefit of society as a whole."
"The CAP budget must, at the very least, stay at current levels and similar resources and objectives must be safeguarded for the new CAP."
"The distribution of CAP resources between farmers in the European Union, which is at the top of the public dialogue agenda, requires care."
"The idea of a flat rate throughout the European Union is broadly opposed."
"In my opinion, we need objective criteria that take due account of the peculiarities of the agricultural sector in the individual EU Member States."
"The proposals to cap direct payments, pay special aid to small-scale farmers and only to pay aid to active farmers are a good idea."
"Agro-environmental measures should be easy to apply, should be flanked by adequate counterbalances and should not create any additional administrative burden."
"With widespread instability on agricultural markets, climate risks and a food crisis, we need to activate effective instruments."
"The current market measures need to be reinforced. We also need a permanent crisis management fund."
"The proposal for a new farm income stabilisation instrument is a good idea."
"Finally, I would highlight the need for effective measures for the benefit of young farmers."
"My thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Albert Dess, for a difficult and complicated job well done."
"Commissioner, any weakening of the CAP will come up against political opposition from the European Parliament."
"I think that this is the cross-party message of this House and serious account needs to be taken of it."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and I am pleased that the report bears unmistakably socialist, social democratic hallmarks."
"We want a sustainable, ecological and social agricultural policy."
"We want greening and we want it in the first pillar."
"Cross-compliance and the agro-environmental measures of the system to date are not enough to achieve support for the whole of society, but that is precisely what we need."
"Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to be active and vital."
"We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people. People to look after the agricultural sector, as well as the areas upstream and downstream."
"The rumours emanating from the Commission concerning plans for massive cuts in rural development in the next multiannual financial framework are not acceptable."
"We must continue to work for a strong second pillar in the common agricultural policy (CAP), for rural areas and for Europe."
"I would like to issue a general warning to anyone intending to cut agricultural funding."
"If this is done, there will be no reform. Everything will then stay the same as it is."
"That will be quite inexplicable to the citizens of Europe."
"Madam President, Parliament's demand to maintain, if not increase, the agricultural budget is in my view highly optimistic."
"These are tough times and budgets are not limitless."
"In my view, these proposals will need a reality check when the overall EU budget is determined some time next year."
"We have to get back to the real priorities of the common agricultural policy. Food security, food safety, biodiversity, climate change, new technologies and creating a viable, competitive market-led industry have to be the focus."
"In my view, the Commission's proposals have lost the direction which we had from the previous two reports."
"They lack focus and they are too complicated."
"I am happy to say that, in his proposals, Albert Dess has set out a very sensible framework in which we can develop future reform."
"(DE) Madam President, the report by Mr Dess is about giving consideration to protection of the environment and the climate in agriculture, as well as increasing the competitiveness of agriculture."
"We have negotiated good compromises on these points."
"I feel that we should speak out in favour of well thought through upper ceilings for farms, particularly when the recipients are multinational groups which sometimes receive sums that simply cannot be justified."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is firmly on the side of farmers when it comes to removing bureaucracy."
"The complete reorganisation of the systems and the associated introduction of additional checks, as called for by others, would make no sense whatsoever."
"We need to be quite clear about one thing: if consumers expect European agriculture to move further towards greening and sustainability, then the measures concerned have to be given the necessary financial resources."
"I am firmly opposed to cuts in the EU agricultural budget in the forthcoming budget period."
"As regards the press reports stating that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, wants to take an axe to rural development, I would state quite clearly that if the Commission cuts the programmes for rural development then it will be cutting off the lifeblood of rural areas."
"Well-functioning farming structures would be dramatically affected by cuts in the second pillar."
"Mr Barroso would be well advised to heed what this House is saying."
"The common agricultural policy is and remains a key area of Community policy and of the EU budget."
"We cannot impose additional constraints on our farms, which are facing increasing global competition, and at the same time reduce their support."
"On the contrary, investment subsidies under the second pillar will promote a keenness and a willingness for innovation. That will benefit everyone in rural areas."
"We must particularly implement measures in respect of young farmers, in order to secure the future of agriculture."
"Our future agricultural policy will decide whether or not Europe is self-sufficient in the future."
"(ES) Madam President, this afternoon's debate clearly reveals that this House supports and is indeed set on achieving a strong common agricultural policy that can rise to the challenges of food safety, environmental sustainability and employment in rural areas."
"If this is to be attained, we cannot allow - as, hopefully, will be upheld by this House - any cuts to the current CAP budget."
"We need to have sufficient funding to respond to these challenges."
"We have to be in a position that allows us to safeguard farmers' incomes, and to put market mechanisms into place in order to prevent and avert price volatility such as we are currently seeing."
"Furthermore, I should not like to forget the events of the last few weeks in the fruit and vegetable sector, which are proof that the new CAP must also provide crisis-response instruments for all the sectors concerned, instruments that are efficient, expeditious and adapted to the needs of each individual sector."
"Madam President, thank you to Mr Dess for a very interesting and informative report."
"Inevitably, on an issue of this complexity, there are bits you agree with and bits you do not."
"With 42% of our European expenditure going on the CAP, it is vital that we provide complete accountability to our citizens."
"Most people, in the face of rising food prices - sharply rising food prices - and dire warnings about lack of supply, will be expecting to see a CAP which focuses clearly on increasing productivity and efficiency."
"Yes, we have to take care of the environment - I am a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we know that - but we are in real danger here of creating a report with a rhetoric moving into things like 'greening Pillar One'; we are talking about moving away from the real focus, which is efficiency."
"On that basis, I do not support the capping of payments to large farms."
"This move will be institutionalising inefficiency and there is no justification for it."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, as you have all done already, we must warmly thank our rapporteur for the commitment he has put into this report and also for his stamina in achieving these compromises."
"I am sure it was not easy, but we have achieved good compromises."
"We stand for competitive and sustainable agriculture in Europe."
"That means that our farmers produce food of the highest quality."
"However, we are also producing a cultural landscape that can be seen, that provides recreational spaces for you all, for all of us, for our society, that provides jobs not just in agriculture but also in tourism and in many other areas."
"That is a service that agriculture provides for society, but this is respected far too little by society - and sometimes also by us."
"It is an extensive service, and such an extensive service does not deserve to have the agricultural budget cut if it is at all possible."
"Commissioner, we support you in your approach of bringing more ecology and more greening into the first pillar."
"However, this must not result in those countries and those farmers which already have very ambitious environmental programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by this new approach."
"A solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides."
"Environmental programmes are expensive."
"When I read in the newspapers - as has been mentioned already by many Members - that cuts are to be made in the second pillar, I reject it vehemently."
"We need a strong first pillar."
"We also need - and have spoken out in favour of this - a strong second pillar."
"We will support you, Commissioner, in these efforts."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, Parliament, the Commission and the Council all agree in that the budget of the CAP should be appropriate and should be maintained at least at the current level."
"It is important to keep the two-pillar structure, to maintain direct payments and especially the strong rural development policy, and to improve competitiveness and strengthen environmental awareness."
"Innovation, research and development are of key importance as well."
"Environmental public goods and technologies that reduce the effects of climate change and enhance biodiversity and water management should be the focus of rural development."
"Further financial assistance is needed in the future as well to help new Member States close the gap and ensure that they can access rural development aid with better co-financing conditions post-2013, as well."
"It is important to provide equal competitive conditions and equal opportunities for the new Member States from 2014."
"And finally, it is important not to play off large farms and small-sized producers against each other."
"(FR) Madam President, let us admit that it looked like we were heading for disaster with 1 267 amendments."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has therefore chosen to table as few amendments as possible."
"We are proud to stand strong and united with our shadow rapporteur, Mr Le Foll."
"We are also pleased to have worked together with other groups and the rapporteur to produce an ambitious compromise."
"In my view, it is vital that aid should be allocated primarily to active farmers, rather than to landowners."
"This will foster food security, but also agriculture which is more sustainable and environmentally friendly and which ensures better management of resources and contributes to combating climate change."
"In addition, we are delighted to see that the greening component will be a compulsory part of the first pillar, while direct payments will be shared out more evenly between individual Member States and different agricultural sectors."
"In a historic first, we have created a degressive support system based on criteria linked to employment and environmental considerations."
"As for young farmers, support measures and incentives have been introduced to help and encourage them to set up farms."
"Essentially, we have all the ingredients needed to allow the Commission and Parliament to work together on defining the new common agricultural, food and environmental policies that we so urgently need."
"(RO) Madam President, we need a strong agricultural sector, guaranteed by a common agricultural policy, which will have a sufficient budget, capable of ensuring food security in Europe."
"I think that Europe's farmers are entitled to decent incomes, which, along with ensuring food security, provide a basic justification for preserving the CAP."
"However, greater fairness is needed in the distribution of direct payments, both among Member States and farmers."
"I hope that the future legislative proposal will provide a solution for getting rid of the unfair disparities."
"At the same time, I want to thank the Commission for its intention to introduce a simplified funding programme for small farms."
"Programmes for young farmers are also just as important."
"They must be given support in embarking on their farming career, not only as a contribution to rural development, but also to ensure a generational changeover, which is absolutely vital to the medium- and long-term future of European agriculture."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that the Dess report has one very serious flaw."
"Paragraph 16 blatantly contradicts the fundamental principle of equal conditions for competition on the single market."
"On the one hand there is a proposal to move away from the historical reference values, and yet on the other hand there is a proposal to sanction huge differences in direct support for farmers from the individual Member States."
"Some would be given EUR 200-250 per hectare, others EUR 350 or over EUR 400, and we are not just talking about a division into old and new Member States, since farmers from Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, Finland and Sweden would also receive the lower rates."
"It is high time to introduce equal conditions for competition in the agricultural sector, and any differences - which will be obvious - should result solely from objective criteria."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the importance of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution it has made to the development of the EU and to food security."
"Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers."
"Speculation in agricultural commodities and extreme price volatility put food security at risk and require flexible measures."
"Possible market fluctuations must be tackled with counter-cyclical measures, which should be included in the first pillar and be capable of responding swiftly and automatically."
"(PT) Madam President, this report does not address the future challenges mentioned in its title, but more importantly it does not address the serious problems of the present."
"That is why we have tabled a set of draft amendments that we consider essential for a thorough overhaul of the current common agricultural policy."
"I would like to highlight here the ones advocating market regulation measures and intervention mechanisms to guarantee farmers fair prices for their produce, and every country's right to produce."
"Among other examples, we propose keeping the system of milk production quotas as an essential condition for protecting producers in particularly sensitive countries; we advocate maintaining planting rights in the wine sector and maintaining aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation; and we propose setting up a public agricultural insurance scheme, financed from EU funds, to guarantee a minimum income for farmers in the event of natural disasters."
"We have tabled proposals for socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture, a vision that is incompatible with shameless declarations of faith in the market and competitiveness, like those made in this report."
"Madam President, my party favours withdrawal from the EU altogether, and therefore from the CAP."
"However, the reality is that we are in it and we have got to make the best of it."
"What do we think of the Dess report?"
"Well it is a bit like the legendary curate's egg."
"Parts of it are good. The idea of making direct payments conditional upon cross-compliance with environmental protection and landscape management is potentially beneficial, but only as long as they are not tied to the semi-religious precepts of climate change and social diversity nonsense."
"The report recognises that the agricultural sector must continue to be supported by government price intervention, because quantities produced cannot be predicted or planned precisely and demand for agricultural products is low in price elasticity."
"That is important to ensure food security and avoid price volatility."
"The most important thing from our point of view is that the UK must cease to be a net contributor to the cost of the CAP."
"(PT) Madam President, the long process of work that this important report required, including the many compromises reached, have made it a broad-based, well-balanced record of the various interests that the common agricultural policy (CAP) has to address."
"This report provides good guidance for legislative proposals, and I congratulate the rapporteur on that. There are, however, a few proposals that worry me, and I will make sure I follow their progress closely."
"I am referring to the redistribution of aid, which I think should be done strictly within the scope of the first pillar and on the basis of purely objective criteria, so that the aim of redistribution is not subverted by criteria of correctness, which will only tend to maintain the status quo."
"We need a fairer CAP with a large enough budget for what is asked of it."
"I must also mention the need to place the much-abused dairy sector on the CAP political agenda by adopting Amendments 16, 12 and 5."
"(PL) Madam President, the aim of the common agricultural policy is to guarantee continuity in the supply of food to Europe's citizens."
"We must supply safe and high-quality food at affordable prices. This is what consumers expect."
"We must care for the environment when producing and processing food."
"We say yes to the common agricultural policy, and no to its nationalisation."
"We say yes to a large budget, and no to cuts to the common agricultural policy."
"Direct payments should be paid according to a simple method and on an equal basis, to all farmers in all Member States."
"Let us not forget that direct payments account for only part of farmers' income."
"Market regulations are therefore important."
"Good prices and market stability guarantee an income for farmers."
"We must ensure access to public services such as education, health services, transport services, sport and culture for citizens of rural areas."
"These are measures which should fall under the second pillar and cohesion policy."
"Commissioner, let us keep in place a programme which enables us to supply food to Europe's poorest citizens."
"(RO) Madam President, food security is one of the challenges of the future."
"The CAP must respond to this challenge."
"The new policy must continue with the positive features of the current policy and rectify the errors."
"I believe that this is what the Dess report does."
"Two pillars are being proposed: direct payments and rural development."
"Historical criteria are to be removed and objective criteria are required."
"There is no suggestion of an equal direct payment for all Member States."
"There is to be a fair difference, based on geographical and economic conditions, with a minimum and maximum limit in relation to the European average."
"The emphasis is on the environmental element, which is also being simplified."
"A strong rural development component is being retained and a request is being made for the amount of funding in the budget after 2014 to be at least equivalent to the 2013 level."
"I am pleased that Parliament's first report drafted after the Commission communication features very many guiding principles in common with the latter document."
"(ES) Madam President, the most important message issued by this House today is that it wants a fair common agricultural policy, or in other words a CAP that guarantees a sufficient level of income for all producers, irrespective of their activity and of the place where it is conducted."
"To achieve this, we need ambitious policies in the areas of direct payments, market management - including up-to-date intervention prices - and rural development, thus adapting the CAP to the new reality."
"Indeed, the new CAP must be adapted to the 2020 strategy, but this must not entail cuts of even EUR 1, because there is no surfeit of resources for all the environmental, social and health challenges we intend to take on."
"I am particularly satisfied with Commissioner Cioloș's announcement that all possibilities will be explored also within the first pillar to draw young people into agriculture."
"Sometimes, quite rightly, we focus on improving conditions for current workers, but disregard in public debate what we need to do to bring new workers into agriculture so that our production will be assured and improved, in view of the fact that the countries that have lent most support to young farmers are least exposed to land abandonment."
"This challenge, which concerns the whole of Europe, is so serious that it should not by any means be left to the arbitrary determination of domestic policy."
"(FR) Mr President, a point of order: I would like to highlight the shocking attitude of the Hungarian Presidency, which is probably one of the worst that the EU has seen."
"The Presidency attended the first debate on the European Council, left at the start of the debate on the common agricultural policy and has just come back in for the debate on economic governance."
"This is an indication of how much it values European agriculture and European farmers."
"Yet the CAP makes up 40% of the budget: it should have been worth the Hungarian Presidency's while to stay for the discussion."
"I wanted to make that point."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will vote in favour of this own-initiative report because the CAP is a fundamentally important tool for European agriculture and for the protection of EU producers and products as compared with non-European producers and products."
"The main points of the report, which is based on maintaining current funding levels, provide for new and reasonable criteria for allocating funding, since the historical criterion has been abandoned as the parameter for redistributing direct payments."
"Provision has been made for payments to farms, account has been taken of production output and costs, and payments have been simplified."
"The report calls for direct payments to be capped and to be restricted to active farmers, precisely so that the recipients are those who actually cultivate the land, not speculators."
"Another point that we consider significant relates to rural development and to the harnessing of all natural and human potential through quality agricultural production and the protection of mountain areas."
"One of the objectives of the new CAP must be to integrate new farmers, particularly young farmers, with targeted budget headings, and to reduce burdens and bureaucracy."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dess report represents a major step towards reform of the common agricultural policy."
"It is of fundamental importance that we find and deliver an efficient basis for the allocation of agricultural funding."
"This includes making allocations in the first pillar, in particular, fairer."
"I think it is high time to give up the historical approach."
"We have many discussions on how funds are distributed between the Member States, but we also need to discuss how they are allocated within Member States."
"There are major imbalances there, too."
"Less favoured areas, particularly mountain areas and small farms, need to be given special consideration."
"Where less favoured areas are concerned, Commissioner, 12 months ago this House delivered a report on the redefinition of these, in which we were highly critical."
"We have heard nothing more about this and I would be very interested to know the Commission's thinking in this respect."
"Mr President, after over an hour spent debating the report by Mr Dess, I remain very optimistic, not only about tomorrow's vote and the support for a report which, as I said in my introductory remarks, is very similar to the proposals contained in the Commission communication from the end of last year, but also about our future common agricultural policy."
"I would like to repeat what I said in my introduction: I remain committed to the principle of maintaining a balance and complementarity between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy."
"I also intend to keep a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy."
"Indeed, we have many aspirations for the second pillar: on territorial balance, environmental issues, young farmers, small farms, local markets and rural development."
"I can promise you that I, together with President Barroso and the Commission, see the second pillar as a priority."
"It will not be sacrificed in discussions on the future common agricultural policy budget."
"Let me reassure you on that point - and I speak for President Barroso too."
"Nor do I want the question of food, which remains the primary and essential purpose of the common agricultural policy, to be pitted against environmental concerns - and the Commission communication does not pit them against each other, in fact."
"What we are proposing is balanced support for a range of agricultural practices."
"This will ensure a balance between the aim of being financially competitive and the desire to maintain and conserve our natural resources' regenerative capacities."
"In fact, I do not see how agriculture could be competitive in the medium and long term without careful management of natural resources."
"That is why we want to find a balance within the CAP, rather than pitting food concerns against environmental issues."
"Then there is the question of a more targeted common agricultural policy."
"Mr Ashworth raised this point, although I see that he is no longer here."
"The Commission is proposing more targeted direct payments."
"Here again, I consider that the proposals made in Mr Dess's report are very much in line with what the Commission plans to include in its legislative proposals."
"We will propose measures that will allow us to deal with crises, be they market crises, health crises or crises related to extreme weather."
"That is the kind of instruments that we will be proposing."
"I would also like to thank Parliament for supporting us in this key aim, which will provide reassurance to farmers in the future."
"Having made these additional comments, let me conclude by reiterating my confidence about tomorrow's vote and in the quality of the Dess report."
"I can promise you that in October, when the Commission presents its legislative proposals, you will recognise all the key elements."
"I would like to thank you once again for this work, which has brought real added value to the legislative package that the Commission will be tabling."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank everyone for this intense debate, and also for the support that I have been given here."
"Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation."
"European agriculture is a positive factor."
"It feeds more than 500 million people, farms and looks after more than 170 million hectares of arable land and pasture, it provides many jobs in areas upstream and downstream, is an important buttress of rural areas and is already the most sustainable agricultural sector in the world."
"I therefore cannot understand why President Barroso has spoken of huge cuts in the second pillar."
"In so doing he is also jeopardising the EU2020 goals - in other words, his own goals."
"When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak?"
"Here I should like to emphasise - as has been mentioned a couple of times today already - that there have been departures from my original report on some matters."
"I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did."
"Had I written the report as it stands today, what would I have had to offer in the compromise negotiations?"
"I allowed enough margin to ensure that everyone could be pacified, and a good result has been achieved today."
"My report therefore had a substantial buffer."
"The result I wanted to achieve was for us to send a signal as Parliament that we are addressing the important aspects that are necessary if European farmers are to have a good future."
"Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together."
"I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have."
"We are able to offer you that."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Agriculture provides security of supply of affordable, quality food; it provides essential protection for the environment and for balanced land use; and it creates jobs, growth and wealth."
"Giving money to farmers simply on the basis of the amount of land they own cannot be justified."
"We have successfully pushed to change subsidies, so that 80% of subsidies no longer benefit just 20% of the largest farmers, and in this way we have helped small farmers."
"We have paved the way for a common agricultural policy that is fairer to the countries of the European Union and to farmers and different kinds of production; that respects the specific conditions in our regions; that is environmentally friendly; and that promotes employment in rural areas."
"With regard to milk quotas, we have to check whether or not it is in fact a good idea to continue to implement a decision made eight years ago, on the basis of forecasts."
"This point is extremely important for the Azores in view of the fact that the sector plays a strategic role and quotas have been very important to milk producers until now."
"I must emphasise this, because alternatives to the milk quota scheme have not yet been put forward."
"We are all aware of the potential and crucial role the common agricultural policy has in achieving environmental and climate targets, in providing public goods and also in attaining the EU's food security targets."
"However, it is extremely important that, when we talk about agriculture and the future of the CAP, 'simplification' and 'innovation' are the watchwords."
"We must focus on those policy measures which do not impose new administrative burdens because we do not want to make our farmers' lives even harder."
"The common agricultural policy must become fairer and simpler."
"I believe that we need to find a fair balance between the policy objectives we are proposing and the administrative burden."
"We need to safeguard farmers' welfare and strengthen local economies."
"We have to protect the environment and also be concerned about producing high-quality, safe and healthy food."
"When it comes to agriculture, we must not focus exclusively on technological solutions or on discussions about technological solutions."
"We also have to take into account consumption patterns, the issue of waste and the complex relationship between the environment, biodiversity and health."
"in writing. - Firstly I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"The final document sends a clear message to the Commission, which is currently in the middle of its internal budget discussion on the next financial programme: namely that Parliament sees the future common agricultural policy as one that is capable of delivering for the European economy in terms of employment and growth."
"It is a policy that will deal with the challenges of food security; it is a policy that will deliver public goods, protect the environment and enhance biodiversity; and it is a vehicle for tackling climate change."
"Reducing European farmers' capacity and hampering their competitiveness and viability with a weak CAP budget would be counterproductive and short-sighted."
"This is a sector with a wealth of potential for expansion, for growth in the economy, for research and innovation and for tackling climate change."
"The CAP produces measurable results and a clear return on investment with regard to the delivery of public goods."
"The CAP post-2014, as outlined in this report, has clear aims and priorities, on which European farmers can and will deliver - but they need the support of a credible budget behind them."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that the report drafted by Mr Dess is vital in the context of the global food crisis and current environmental risks."
"The new version of the common agricultural policy includes values such as consumer protection and regional cohesion."
"I think that long-term productivity depends, to a large extent, on the sustainable management of natural resources, which is another objective on the agenda."
"I welcome the initiative promoting more active involvement by farmers in rural development programmes, which will help boost local competitiveness."
"Food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy."
"Cooperation between Member States is essential, as demonstrated during the E. coli crisis this summer."
"In order to avoid food price fluctuations, I support the adoption of additional risk-prevention measures available to all EU farmers."
"At the same time, I think that it is important for agricultural funds to be distributed fairly."
"On this point, I should stress, for example, the impact of direct aid on boosting small farms' profitability and competitiveness."
"Special payments must also be programmed for areas with natural handicaps which have special needs."
"in writing. - As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a committed environmental campaigner, I expected a Dess report which would represent a CAP for the carbon era - one based upon environmental incentives, resource management, and a strong investment in the wider environmental issues facing the EU."
"As such, I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP; to supporting small- and medium-sized food producers; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture."
"Given that the Commission is broadly in agreement with the Parliament's proposals, I call on this House to make their voice heard in ensuring that the European Council also supports this report's environmental proposals."
"in writing. - (RO) The common agricultural policy is faced with a number of challenges calling for the European Union and Member States to make a strategic decision about the future of agriculture."
"To be able to tackle these challenges effectively, the CAP must operate in an environment of sound economic policies and sustainable public funding which will help the Union achieve its EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"I think that the European Union also needs to have in the future adequate instruments for tackling the crises affecting the market and food supply, as well as the fluctuations in the prices and market in the agricultural sector."
"I think that CAP funds need to be shared fairly for the first and second pillars, both among Member States and among farmers within a Member State."
"This will tangibly reduce the great disparities in how these funds are shared among Member States."
"The CAP's second pillar is of paramount importance for rural development."
"I think that particular attention should be focused on motivating and encouraging young farmers."
"Consequently, I am in favour of introducing in this pillar targeted measures which will be defined by Member States, with the aim of achieving the EU's priority targets so that compensation payments are maintained for the disadvantaged areas in the second pillar."
"Agriculture is without a doubt the economic sector in which the European Union has achieved the most."
"The current debate takes place against the backdrop of the Commission's plans to unveil vital proposals for reform in October."
"This House has reached a compromise in the report under discussion."
"We have retained two strong pillars: the first pillar, direct aid, needs adequate funding that reflects the challenges facing agriculture, which means at least maintaining current financing levels."
"However, it will also be brought more into line with the second pillar, support for sustainable development."
"I believe that the greening of the first pillar needs to be judged correctly, so that it does not add to the environmental requirements with which farmers are already seriously burdened."
"After all, their primary role is to produce food."
"The report also reaches out to young farmers who, as we know, struggle to get started in the sector."
"However, clearly these objectives can only be achieved if the Union's budget is not cut."
"What is the point of having ambitious aims if we do not have the means to realise them?"
"We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have worked hard to ensure that the new EU agricultural policy is oriented towards ecological standards."
"In our view, farmers must be rewarded for providing services to society."
"That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market."
"Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning."
"By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much."
"The report is a good compromise; it is a European compromise."
"The question now is what the Commission, and particularly President Barroso, will make of it."
"Cutting the funding for environmental protection in particular suggests narrow-mindedness, and I hope Commissioner Cioloş will be able to talk him out of it."
"This report proposes the continuity of the common agricultural policy (CAP), though with some contradictions."
"We therefore take a critical stance, and we have put forward alternative proposals that respond effectively both to the need for agricultural production to ensure food sovereignty and food security in every country, and to the problems of family farming and rural development."
"These proposals all take into account the social importance of the land and of the people who work it, the specific characteristics of each country and social justice in the distribution of grants, both among Member States and among crops and farmers."
"That is why we have put forward this set of proposals, in which in particular we clearly and unequivocally advocate the system of production quotas adapted to each Member State according to its food requirements, thus ensuring that farmers in countries such as Portugal are protected."
"We want to guarantee every country's right to produce, and we are against liberalisation of the dairy sector and of planting rights in the wine sector."
"We also want to maintain aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation beyond 2012, and we uphold the 'existence of market regulation instruments and intervention mechanisms to ensure fair prices for production', thus countering the deregulating trend of previous CAP reforms."
"Europe will need a strong agriculture even after 2013, because the principal means of guaranteeing European citizens' food security is European agriculture."
"Food production has to remain the primary aim of agriculture, because the world population continues to grow and is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2045."
"However, we need a strong common agricultural policy and strong agricultural assistance to achieve this goal."
"I therefore consider it important that pursuant to the report, the agricultural budget be maintained at least at the same level as in 2013 in the next EU financing period."
"This March, the Hungarian Presidency adopted presidential conclusions serving the interests of European farmers."
"The excessive price volatility in the previous period is partly the consequence of wrong decisions taken by the EU, for instance the abolition of maize intervention."
"Thus, we need an agricultural policy which ensures efficient action against extreme price volatility and speculation."
"The milk crisis made it clear that measures to restrict production are needed in the milk sector."
"In Member States where there was a higher-than-average decrease in sugar production as a result of the sugar reform, production must be allowed to increase."
"in writing. - It is imperative that the CAP is adequately equipped to rise to the challenges it will have to face in the future."
"The CAP cannot be monolithic; it should be implemented with flexibility and within the current economic and political context."
"A regulatory policy-based framework should be developed with long-term goals in mind."
"This would afford small farmers greater stability and would enable them to draw up investment plans over a broader time horizon without concern for the disruption that could be caused by short-term quick-fix policies and give them the support they need to safeguard their business."
"The agriculture sector's susceptibility to market instability and price volatility must be addressed and the CAP should guarantee a safety-mechanism and provision for effective risk prevention, which would give farmers a measure of income security in these economically trying times and serve to provide foresight of how global price volatility will affect developing countries."
"The global climatic challenges, the strain posed by demographic changes on food security, as well as the economic recession, should lead to the intensification of efforts to ensure sustainable growth, encourage and protect jobs."
"Dedicated innovation and research will support Europe's transition to becoming more environmentally and economically sustainable."
"in writing. - (FI) This report was a victory for the advocates of Finnish and European agriculture."
"Owing to our northern location, we in Finland are at a considerable natural disadvantage when it comes to growing crops, and so it is important that there are no changes to the amount of aid that we receive."
"Parliament's position is a strong message for the Commission, which is drafting its proposal for the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Restrictions on current levels of national aid cannot be acceptable after this."
"Food security is and will remain the main challenge facing EU agriculture."
"It is not the only one, as is also highlighted in the OECD-FAO report 'Agricultural Outlook 2011-2020'."
"I think that we must focus particular attention on the demographic challenges affecting the countryside in particular."
"If we fail to handle the demographic changes and make rural areas more attractive to young farmers, we run the risk, within a certain period of time, of this situation becoming a real obstacle preventing stable, high-quality agricultural production."
"With this in mind, we need to offer young people new, attractive measures, consistent financial support and increased access to innovative services and infrastructures."
"In addition to all these measures, there is also a need for better coordination between the financial support allocated to rural development and the other regional policies and for the maintenance of CAP funding at a level ensuring that all the proposed tasks can be achieved."
"This will enable us to facilitate more active economic, social and cultural involvement from young people in European Union agriculture."
"Unfortunately the bold and innovative aims initially proposed by the rapporteur have not survived our discussions."
"In some cases they have been forced to give way to wishy-washy, colourless and insipid compromises."
"I can live with that, particularly when it comes to a fairer distribution of direct payments in Europe to guarantee the smooth operation of the internal market."
"However, I do regret our lack of courage on across-the-board greening of the common agricultural policy."
"Our farmers want to produce healthy food efficiently in order to provide food security for Europe's 500 million citizens."
"Eleven Member States, including Luxembourg, have signed a joint letter to Commissioner Cioloş expressing their opposition to the end of the system of planting rights for vineyards in 2015."
"I am glad that the European Parliament has endorsed that proposal in Mr Dess's report."
"We do need to be careful however: our farmers must not end up working as underpaid landscape gardeners, leaving us dependent on imports of food and agricultural commodities from third countries, products subject to far less stringent requirements than those imposed on our farmers."
"I fully support this position."
"We expect to see it included in the Commissioner's legislative proposals."
"The European Parliament must stand up for a strong, fair and well-financed CAP."
"It is time for us to ensure that direct payments are distributed fairly among Member States, regions and sectors."
"We need to show European citizens that genuine European solidarity exists and not just pay lip service to it."
"Mr Dess's report marks a very small step, but it is in the right direction."
"I also welcome the measures proposed for maintaining territorial balance in the EU."
"I am pleased that support is expressed in the report for young people in the agricultural sector because we must combat depopulation of rural areas."
"It is important that we maintain support for disadvantaged regions and the opportunity for production-related payments in the regions where there is no alternative to a particular production type."
"I am pleased to note that my request for greater flexibility within the second pillar was also heeded."
"The situation in agricultural sectors differs in the various Member States."
"Greater freedom in defining countries' priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop."
"However, it is important for us to take care that the proposed measures do not introduce further red tape for agricultural producers."
"Let us send a strong signal to the European Commission and Europe's agricultural producers, showing our support for a fairer, simpler and more flexible CAP."
"in writing. - (DE) A healthy farming sector - and I am not talking here about agro-industrial factories, but rather about small-scale family farms - provides a guarantee of the continued existence of rural culture, nature and our cultural landscape, as well as being essential to securing the supply of food for our population."
"Just how important the latter is has been made clear to us once again by the recent enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) crisis."
"Consumers make great demands of organic produce."
"They expect organic produce to provide ecological balance, which in reality is often more than questionable."
"Rather than having an especially positive impact on sustainability, the prudent use of resources, CO2 savings and the protection of livestock, organic produce is often transported right across Europe."
"The EU needs to act here - and I speak as a representative of Austria, the leading country in organic farming."
"Greater importance must be attached to regional provision and seasonal availability, as well as strict labelling of the origin of foods."
"Services provided by agriculture must therefore be recompensed by fair product prices."
"Let us not use the common agricultural policy to promote agro-industry; let us promote our farmers instead."
"in writing. - (FI) The reform of the EU's common agricultural policy is one of this Parliament's most important tasks."
"The report by Mr Dess is a good basis for continuing the reform."
"We need a broader debate, however, to achieve the objective of environmentally friendly, resource-effective and diverse agriculture."
"The answer to the global problems of agriculture will not be found by increasing production in Europe, but is part of a broader equation, in which economic, social and environmental issues are taken into account."
"Instead of a narrow-minded agricultural policy, we need a food policy that considers the whole food production chain, from start to finish."
"That is the best way that we can respond to the serious, all-encompassing challenges faced by agriculture in its present form in the 2000s."
"I am delighted to learn that the new common agricultural policy will end the period of discrimination against farmers in certain Member States, including my own."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which is clearly the work of an author who understands the issues involved."
"I am all the more alarmed by the attempt to establish new discriminatory conditions."
"The capping of direct payments is a new form of discrimination against Member States in which, for historical reasons, most of the agricultural undertakings manage larger areas of land."
"These agricultural undertakings comply with the same rules and provide the same services as small undertakings in other countries, and they fulfil the conditions for direct payments equally well."
"The discrimination against large undertakings resulting from capping may put jobs in rural areas at risk, and stifle innovative potential."
"If we want to talk credibly about a single market, can we really countenance discrimination against certain Member States in the form of differences in payments per hectare or capping?"
"Farmers from the 12 new Member States have now reached the end of a difficult 10-year period, which they agreed to on the understanding that it was a transitional period which would not be extended."
"Let us not prolong these inequalities contrary to the spirit of the EU accession negotiations, and let us not damage the credibility of the EU in the eyes of some of its citizens."
"We are gambling with the future of the EU itself."
"I would therefore like to call on all fellow Members to support Amendments 10 and 11, which reject the capping of payments."
"A fundamental requirement for fair competition on the internal market is the establishment of fair and transparent conditions for all farmers throughout the EU."
"The report on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is heading in this direction."
"Many of the negotiated compromises should be welcomed unequivocally, for example the simplification of administrative procedures in various areas of the CAP, or the continuation of full funding for direct payments in the EU budget and the refusal to renationalise these."
"However, I regard the issue of European farmers getting preferential treatment or being put at a disadvantage on the basis of additional criteria, for example the size of holdings, as problematic in view of the historically determined nature of the situation in the individual Member States."
"I wish to express my satisfaction with this first text on the future of the CAP."
"Even at this early stage, it aims to send the Commission what is a positive message for our farmers, pending receipt of the legislative text."
"Indeed, I consider that many paragraphs contain information that I and some of my colleagues sought to include."
"I refer to the important statements that promote our southern agriculture."
"For example, direct aid will no longer simply be based on a premium per hectare, but the size of the farm, employment arrangements, labour productivity and legal form will also be taken into consideration at long last."
"I am also very pleased that these payments will only be awarded to farmers who are truly active in the sector, so that the aid goes to those who genuinely need it and who use it to benefit agriculture."
"Provision has also been made to distribute aid more evenly, bearing in mind that, for historical reasons, farms in the European Union have very diverse structures."
"I fully support the paragraph calling for the new CAP to be equipped with the instruments necessary to limit price volatility."
"I will conclude by mentioning the most common form of agricultural production in my region, olive oil production, and the measure that we are awaiting from the Commission: an updated private storage system and the introduction of private storage."
"With food security being a key factor in globalisation nowadays, we need to maintain our capacity for being self-sufficient."
"This means maintaining an ambitious common agricultural policy that can satisfy our most basic long-term need: food."
"The CAP does, however, need to be tweaked to make it fairer."
"European citizens would not understand if the bulk of assistance were to go to large agricultural operators: small farmers too must be able to make a living from what they produce, work in decent conditions and be paid fairly."
"When allocating aid, we must also give more thought to natural constraints, such as global warming, mountain areas and scarce water supplies."
"The current drought demonstrates that the CAP urgently needs to include practical resources that will allow our farmers to deal with water shortages."
"I would therefore appeal for a subtle shift in the CAP to make it more relevant and able to guarantee our food self-sufficiency, the vitality of our agricultural sector and the preservation of our rural areas."
"Prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances - Implementation of excessive deficit procedure - Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances_-_C7-0301/2010 -"
"by Mr Feio, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure -"
"by Mrs Ford, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States - 2010/0277(NLE)]"
"by Mrs Goulard, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area - C7-0298/2010 -"
"by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies - C7-0300/2010 -, and"
"by Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area - C7-0299/2010 -."
"Mr President, in the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the component of the economic governance package that deals with the Stability and Growth Pact is not the response that Europe requires at this time of structural crisis."
"The package does indeed revisit the Stability and Growth Pact, but not to change its essence."
"It revisits it to make its demands broader and its penalties tougher."
"It would seem more useful to assume that the pact is impossible to comply with if a country's economy is not growing and, in particular, if there is a crisis."
"These issues should be at the heart of the political agenda."
"We should discuss having a crisis management policy and its associated instruments in euro area countries and, on another matter, how to prevent the persistently divergent evolution of the euro economies from destroying the single currency."
"If these issues are not resolved, the pact becomes stupid, as someone said."
"There is, however, a glimmer of hope in the package: the new initiative to identify and correct the macroeconomic imbalances that build up, particularly in the eurozone, before they become insoluble problems."
"Parliament wanted responsibilities as co-legislator and has carried them out to the full."
"The text on which we are going to vote reflects a broad consensus, which was only possible thanks to everyone's huge capacity for work and spirit of compromise."
"As rapporteur, I wish to thank all my fellow Members from all political groups, particularly my shadow rapporteurs, and I pick out Mr Haglund especially, for whom I acted as shadow rapporteur as well."
"The trialogue phase was long and hard, and the agreement we reached - sadly not a full one - was due to the Hungarian Presidency, represented by Minister Kármán, the Commission, represented by Commissioner Rehn, and all our partners."
"Let us speak plainly: identifying macroeconomic imbalances is a complex and completely novel process."
"Rather than merely applying sanctions, it is important to identify the risks competently, find out whether they are the country's responsibility or whether they result from external impacts, and make correct, timely and practicable recommendations."
"After the negotiating process, the scoreboard - that is, the set of indicators that have been negotiated - includes not only financial and nominal indicators, but also indicators from the real economy."
"We also trust that the Commission will scrupulously respect the compromise of recital 6-A, which involves Parliament alongside the Council in future review processes."
"Interpretation will also not be done automatically, but intelligently through in-depth reviews, which are demanding for the Commission but necessary."
"The Commission's recommendations will have to ensure consistency with all the other strategic documents, but the country will bear the main responsibility for proposing solutions to implement."
"Parliament's enhanced powers, the greater involvement of the social partners and respect for collective bargaining practices have all been guaranteed."
"Penalties are justified in cases of lack of cooperation but not where countries are unable to meet the targets."
"They are also graded, which is an important aspect."
"We would have preferred to lighten the penalties, but we had to agree to them as part of the compromises."
"Before agreement can be reached, there is one fundamental stumbling block: the recognition that in an internal market, in a monetary area, it makes sense that the variations in the scoreboard indicators should be observed whether they are positive or negative, and that both deficits and surpluses should be subject to observation, even though they obviously do not give rise to similar recommendations."
"All of us - individual Members, political groups and institutions - have come a long way."
"Agreement on a balanced, high-quality text is in sight."
"I just hope that the spirit of compromise that has brought us this far will carry us through to a final agreement."
"Mr President, this is a further stage in an exceptional piece of work that we have been doing in the European Parliament."
"At this point I must warmly acknowledge Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Goulard, Mr Haglund, Mrs Ferreira and Mrs Ford, who have been rapporteurs with me throughout this economic governance package."
"I must also offer a very special word of thanks to the various shadow rapporteurs who have helped us in our work."
"Lastly, I must emphasise the exceptional work carried out by the Council on this issue, especially by András Kármán, who worked closely with us, and Commissioner Rehn, who also played an invaluable part in the whole process."
"My first word is one of confidence, in a positive vein."
"This economic governance package must show that Europe is capable: it is capable of overcoming difficulties and it is capable of guarding against future problems."
"That is why I am highly confident about what is going to happen with this economic governance legislation in the coming days."
"In the Stability and Growth Pact, for which I was rapporteur for the corrective part, it is possible to add the idea of growth to that of stability and budgetary discipline."
"It is possible to innovate with the macroeconomic imbalance procedure."
"It is possible to go beyond an approach of merely having a penalty mechanism, and that is why adoption of this economic governance package will lead to more Europe and better Europe."
"In relation to the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact, for example, this economic governance package has brought us a more intelligent application of the pact, through the attention it devotes to the debt criterion; the introduction of an average rate for debt reduction, to be carried out over three years, allowing for flexibility in fulfilling the rules; a more detailed and appropriate list of relevant factors that the Commission should take into account in its assessment of the financial situation of the countries involved; and the introduction of a three-year transition period for implementation of the debt criterion."
"There are also other aspects that I want to highlight here, which concern other reports."
"Because we worked in conjunction all the time, I must mention the important introduction of a European semester regime in the preventive part, and point out that the preventive part is essential and that penalties should only be applied as the final step in this whole procedure."
"The procedure includes the introduction of symmetry in the analysis of macroeconomic indicators, the possibility that the Commission will produce a study on Eurobonds by the end of this year, an integrated vision of penalties as a final step in relation both to macroeconomic imbalances and to the Stability and Growth Pact, and the question of introducing reverse qualified majority voting for Council decisions."
"All these steps have been taken as essential parts of Parliament's role."
"That is why we can send our citizens a very clear message right now."
"The message is that we are preparing an institutional mechanism to prevent future crises."
"Europe will be much better prepared with this economic governance package."
"Europe is taking a crucial step with this economic governance package so that our economy can grow soundly."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Council."
"We can all see the incredibly sensitive situation in Europe and especially in the eurozone which has required different countries to work together in a way that has never been seen before."
"We can see the vital need to improve competitiveness and rebuild public finances in a sustainable manner."
"Over recent days, weeks and months, we have constantly seen ministers from Member States coming together to try to help find ways out of each other's individual problems."
"In addition, never before have I seen such a desire from members of the public to understand where public money is spent."
"So let me first talk about the directive that I have worked on."
"The directive sets out a series of requirements in accounting statistics, forecasting and budgetary processes."
"Let us not forget that inadequate budget planning and inaccurate information compounded this crisis."
"It is a Council directive, not a co-legislative report, and the Council has debated this extensively."
"Member States themselves have agreed that they will adopt fiscal planning horizons of at least three years to include all levels of government and government funds in their budget processes and ensure that information on, for example, contingent liabilities is disclosed."
"Accounting and forecasting performance will be independently evaluated."
"Let me say that many of the Member States already comply with large parts of this directive, but implementing this minimum series of requirements will introduce discipline and restore confidence, and is a first small step back on the path to stability in public finances."
"In addition, Member States themselves have agreed that they will each introduce their own legislation on fiscal rules - not necessarily German constitution debt breaks - but rules tailor-made in each country to keep them in line with their obligations under the Treaty."
"Now this is sensitive as well because different countries have different obligations under the Treaty and for that reason that section does not apply to the UK."
"During the negotiations on the wider 'six pack' a number of suggestions for improving this Council directive were made, many by the European Central Bank and by Members of this House."
"The Council has worked in good faith to try and improve the directive where appropriate and improve transparency, but without stepping on the sensitive issues relating to individual national constitutions."
"Briefly on the other directives."
"Through these negotiations I have tried to be constructive in allowing euro zone Member States in particular to set up what rules and sanctions they see necessary to underpin their stability."
"I have not supported colleagues who think the solution is just a stronger role for the European Parliament."
"Over the weekend and on Monday night, the Council tried to offer a final compromise on an outstanding issue of votes in the European Council."
"Whilst this is not, in my opinion, a deeply significant issue in my own Member State - as we do not intend to join the euro and resulting fines do not apply to us - it is an extremely difficult and contentious issue in many countries, including those who intend to join."
"This is a time to try to understand each other's problems but also respect each other's differences."
"Earlier this week I warned colleagues that heading into a direct confrontation between Parliament and the Council on an issue that I did not believe I could explain to any man on the street would not be a responsible position of this Parliament."
"Indeed, I said I thought it would be irresponsible."
"And this Parliament's approach on that issue is not supported by many of my group's members."
"I cannot support Parliament's changes to the Council text on the macroeconomic imbalances and I would like to see in the weeks ahead more clarity on the different positions between euro zone and non-euro-zone Member States."
"Mr President, we have had countless trialogue meetings, some late at night, with other Members, the Commission and the Hungarian Presidency."
"I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members and our counterparts for the work that we have completed together."
"The message from the Ecofin Council is that everyone needs to shoulder their responsibilities."
"My immediate reaction is to say: 'All right, then, let us genuinely face up to our responsibilities.'"
"Not with a huge fanfare, not so as to be able to say that we reached an agreement rapidly, but with an eye on the financial problems in the euro area and the European Union and in an attempt to come up with some proper solutions."
"Certainly, that was my group's motto in these negotiations."
"I doubt that the markets and our citizens would believe in speedy but superficial solutions."
"In our estimation, substantial improvements are needed."
"We have, I think, already achieved some of the objectives that we set ourselves."
"Let me remind you that we are not the only ones with these aims: on several occasions, the European Central Bank has called on Parliament to beef up the Commission's already bold proposals."
"We have therefore firmed up the rules."
"That was one of our guiding principles: not for the pleasure of rule-making, but because breaking common rules in a community based on the rule of law endangers the single currency."
"We have introduced penalties for fraud."
"Unfortunately this is one of the lessons that we have had to learn from the euro's early years."
"As Mrs Ford said, we have also tried to impose a degree of order on national budgetary procedures, if only so as to be able to compare practices in different countries."
"One point was particularly important to me: if we go to our citizens with nothing to say other than 'we have increased automaticity', as the newspapers are putting it, they will be left with the impression that some mysterious machine has been turned on in Brussels and will rap them on the knuckles whenever something goes wrong."
"If we want stricter rules, they need to be more intelligent, but above all we need more democratic debate and more cross-border discussions."
"This is why we have proposed - and I would like to thank all the Members who have supported me on this point - creating what we have termed an economic dialogue, which must be proportionate."
"There is no threat to national constitutions; it is simply an expression of our desire for more discussion within the euro area in particular, but also in the Europe of 27."
"We want this House to be the forum for that transparent dialogue between the European institutions and the Member States, and in particular a place where Member States can voice their problems and explain their positions."
"Some countries are lagging behind, others are further ahead, some are on the fringes, some have larger populations: we need to bear all that in mind."
"I am delighted to see that this week in the German media Mr Habermas has again stressed that increasing democratic legitimacy is a vital necessity."
"I would say to Mrs Ford that we are not arguing in favour of enhancing our powers, we are calling for a greater role for those mandated by the people to defend their interests in Brussels."
"There are other important points, particularly on the macroeconomic side."
"I believe that all Member States need to be subject to common surveillance."
"Symmetry is an important issue."
"The Council should understand what this means: intelligent symmetry that distinguishes between deficit and surplus, but symmetry all the same."
"Let me close by mentioning Eurosecurities, which were one of the things that I championed."
"I would like to make an appeal to all political group leaders: you cannot claim to support Eurosecurities but vote against them."
"You might argue that you want more, I myself would have liked to go further, but I do fully appreciate the efforts that Commissioner Rehn is willing to make."
"Let me remind you that the Commissioner himself put forward proposals in May 2010 in accordance with the Commission's legislative initiative."
"We want to put those proposals back on track."
"We want the euro finally to take on the mantle of a world currency, we want a large and liquid market, which will reduce the cost of borrowing."
"We want part of that borrowing - a limited amount, of course - to be shared in the long term using a full-blown market regulatory instrument."
"Consequently, I hope that tomorrow's vote will be favourable and that all those who claim to be in favour of Eurosecurities will discuss the issue in a spirit of open-mindedness rather than based on ideological prejudices."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, if one thing is clear, it is that Europe needs a solid foundation in order to prevent a new euro crisis in the future and to ensure sustainable economic growth."
"Our group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), is satisfied with the results we have achieved so far in the legislative package on economic governance."
"I would like to extend my warm thanks to all the Members, rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs, employees, staff and everyone for the many hours we have spent together in order to achieve this because, in exercising its powers, the European Parliament has taken a firm and ambitious position."
"I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency, and in particular András Kámán, for the efforts put in to bridging the differences between the Council and Parliament."
"Indeed, you personally have made it possible for us to reach a 98% agreement, partly thanks to the helpful support of Commissioner Rehn and his staff."
"This is an excellent result, but it was not an easy one to achieve."
"Tomorrow, we will be voting on the reports."
"My group is strongly committed to building on the high level of agreement that we have reached."
"I hope that we will be able to bridge the last differences over the next few weeks so that we can finalise an agreement before the summer."
"This is very important, because my group is striving for a final vote in the plenary in July."
"The turmoil in the financial markets continues and we urgently need to find a solution to the debt crisis in several countries."
"However, it is just as urgent - and therein now lies our task as co-legislator - that Europe demonstrates strong decision making in terms of an ambitious stability pact and economic governance."
"Reaching a decision before the summer is crucial to restoring confidence in the euro, given that the Stability and Growth Pact was being broken as early as 2003."
"Instead of the rules being enforced, they were simply liberalised and we now need to put a stop to that."
"This is about credible legislation, not behind-the-scenes negotiations between Member States aimed at avoiding penalties."
"If Member States fail to take effective action in order to meet their commitments and reduce their deficits - and these are commitments, remember, that they have undertaken of their own free will - then decision-making must be effective."
"That is why this House has proposed the reverse voting procedure."
"Let us face it, the magic formula of our fellow Members on the left, the golden rule, will not deliver the solution."
"Unfortunately, money does not grow on trees and the days of easy solutions and painless choices are now behind us."
"That is why the PPE Group is calling for sustainable public finances and for 5 or 6% budget deficits not to be permitted."
"A debt burden - the painful evidence of which we are witnessing - stands in the way of economic growth, not only in our European countries, but also in the United States."
"We need a solid foundation, and that is why I am pleased that the Council will exercise the preventive arm of the proposals, namely to ensure that Member States strengthen their own national responsibilities and involve their national parliaments in the process, clear deadlines, procedures and inspection visits, more public reports, peer pressure and public debates in this House rather than in the confines of the Council."
"Obviously, the European semester is an important achievement, because we want jobs and growth."
"We are facing an important and historic day."
"Tomorrow, in the House, we will stand ready to shoulder our responsibilities."
"I see that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to put a spanner in the works."
"It seems that they only want to work in a spirit of compromise when it comes to their own reports."
"Mr President, that is no spirit of compromise."
"I would like to call on all Members who consider sustainable public finances important to support these six reports tomorrow."
"They are not the final outcome, because tomorrow we will be taking a step towards consulting with the Council on how we can clear these last hurdles on our way to - what will hopefully be - an agreement in July."
"Mr President, I believe that the events that we have been able to follow this week, both in the Council and in those countries that are wrestling with very serious economic problems, once again show us why the package we are now debating is so important."
"If we do not manage to make headway on these matters, the problems are more likely to continue rather than be resolved."
"I also believe that it is important to remember what happened in 2005 when we ought to have taken action and demonstrated that it is not all right to contravene the common allocation clauses."
"We did not do that; instead we changed the rules."
"Now it is time to rectify this."
"This package is important."
"I would like to say a big thank you to my fellow Members."
"We worked hard together."
"As has been said many times, we are very close to achieving the goal, but at the same time it is important that we are successful in the voting today and in July."
"I would also like to thank Mr Kármán from the Hungarian Presidency, who has done a splendid job."
"We really appreciate what he has done."
"As I said, I would also like to thank my fellow Members, and Mrs Ferreira in particular."
"We have done an excellent job in creating a macroeconomic surveillance procedure, which is something new and which complements the work that is done to keep the common currency afloat."
"That is something that Europe needs."
"Going back to 2005, the European Parliament is still demanding that we find a solution with regard to what we refer to as reversed qualified majority voting."
"Why is that?"
"It is because we have found that if we do not have an adequate automatic decision-making system in the Council, the necessary decisions do not get taken."
"We cannot afford for this to happen any longer."
"In this regard, we still have an unresolved issue, but I hope that the Council will manage to hold a serious discussion on what this is actually about."
"The European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday."
"It must not be the case that, for reasons of prestige, no decision is taken on something that everyone knows is necessary."
"Nor must it be the case that certain larger Member States think that they can agree in advance on certain matters, so making it a 'done deal'."
"The Council must take genuine decisions and the legislation must be decided on in consultation with the European Parliament."
"The Council now has the opportunity to take wise decisions, and I am sure that the European Parliament can help it to take the right ones."
"With regard to the macroeconomic element, I would firstly like to emphasise that, thanks to the work that we have done in Parliament, we have a proposal that we have agreed on with the Council and one that is sufficiently transparent and also contains a solution that is sufficiently automatic."
"I believe that this solution means that we will also be able to feel secure in future with regard to the euro area and to the possibility of remedying the sorts of economic problems in an individual country that could otherwise result in the whole of the euro area being put at risk."
"I think it is good that, in our report, we establish a system for dealing with countries that fail to fulfil their commitments, in other words a requirement for the problems to be remedied directly."
"The first time a promise is broken, the country will be forced to pay an interest-bearing deposit, as we have called it."
"This is necessary."
"We cannot send out a signal to the effect that if a country promises to do something in particular, but then fails to do it there will be no consequences."
"Unfortunately, that is what the original proposal was like."
"I am pleased that we were able to rectify that."
"This is an important matter of principle."
"At the same time, we have also got to grips with the problem of fraud, where other countries are deceived."
"This is also extremely important."
"I think that the European Parliament has done a good job in this regard."
"As several speakers have said, tomorrow's vote is a very important one, and I believe that it will go well."
"I hope that, at the end of this week and through the following week, the European Council will be able to have a serious discussion about what we can do to reach an agreement."
"That is something that we will also do in Parliament."
"Then we can have the legislation that Europe so badly needs."
"That is crucial if we are going to be able to continue to have a common currency."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, before I go into the substance, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and all representatives of the political groups who actively participated in the process for all their valuable contributions."
"I am equally thankful to the Commission, and the Commissioner himself, for their efforts to facilitate discussions, not only during the trilogues here in Parliament but within the Council too."
"The six legislative texts on economic governance have been the number one priority of the Hungarian Presidency."
"I must emphasise that it was not the individual decision of the Presidency to designate this file as the top priority."
"The Commission's initiative has also been supported by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States."
"If we want to build a stronger euro, this governance package is an essential building block in that process."
"The world economy, including Europe, has experienced the worst crisis since the Great Depression and we have had to draw the necessary conclusions."
"We have to realise that the shock would have long-lasting effects unless we eliminate the core roots of the crisis."
"Many of the lessons to be learned are addressed by the six legislative proposals put forward by the Commission last September."
"More emphasis will be put on prevention in order to avoid the need for harmful procyclical policies in bad economic times."
"So far the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has concentrated on deficit but this has not prevented the accumulation of high debt, so from now on more attention will be paid to the debt criteria."
"The lesson was learned that procedures have not been stringent and automatic enough."
"That is why we are also addressing these questions here, in order to strengthen the credibility of the Pact."
"We have also realised that coordination of fiscal policies through the SGP might not be sufficient in a Union sharing a single currency so we have agreed to introduce a new mechanism to tackle macroeconomic imbalances, which will be treated on the same footing as fiscal imbalances."
"In order to better and more deeply reflect the requirements of the Treaty in national procedures of Member States, we are about to adopt rules improving the quality of national budgetary frameworks."
"I am confident that the objectives of both Parliament and the Council are the same, namely to strengthen the economic governance of the EU and the euro area, prevent future crises and build a stronger framework for economic governance in the euro area and the EU as a whole."
"After an intensive round of trilogues with the rapporteurs and discussions at the Council, the Council modified its general approach on Monday."
"The result of this process was communicated to the European Parliament by a letter sent the next day, 21 June."
"I share the view that during the trilogues the quality of the text has improved a lot, and that the package has become stronger and more coherent."
"This is especially the case in terms of increased transparency and accountability and the more stringent and automatic application of the procedures."
"Firstly, let me mention the major elements as regards increased transparency and accountability."
"We are to describe the European semester in the legal text including the ample involvement of Parliament in the process."
"We have added provisions specifying the process of economic dialogue among European institutions including the European Parliament, the Council and individual Member States."
"The European Parliament would be involved on the same footing as the Council in the setting up and functioning of the scoreboard of indicators for an alert mechanism in the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances."
"Regarding the governance cycle and the surveillance procedure, we fully respect the very important role of relevant national stakeholders, including social partners."
"Secondly, turning to the issue relating to a more stringent and automatic application of the procedures, let me mention the following: an additional sanction, an interest-bearing deposit for Member States in the excessive imbalance procedure, would be introduced."
"This has been a missing link in the procedures and it completes the procedure in a very logical way, similar to that provided for in the budgetary surveillance."
"An additional fine for Member States falsifying their fiscal statistics is also provided for, at the initiative of the Parliament."
"The application of reverse qualified majority voting is expanded to the recommendation on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances."
"Moreover, in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, we make provision for a review of the expansion of reverse qualified majority voting."
"At the same time, the already existing comply-or-explain procedure would be enhanced."
"In deciding on the staff in the SGP, the Council is expected, as a rule, to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission or to explain its position publicly."
"The Presidency believes that the compromise reached during the trilogues reflects a good, balanced and comprehensive approach."
"We think that all parties have a strong interest in reaching a swift agreement."
"I regret that the proposal put forward to the plenary is different from the compromise we arrived at after a series of negotiation rounds and does not take into account the final compromise offer of the Council."
"At the same time, I am grateful for your wise approach that the Parliament still leaves open the possibility to have a first reading agreement shortly."
"It is high time that Europe joined forces and the Union is ready to live up to expectations."
"All the markets and investors are vigilant and would like to see whether we can deliver or not."
"The swift and timely adoption of the package is a must for all of us."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - President, honourable Members, let me first thank the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs Sharon Bowles, rapporteurs Corien Wortmann-Kool, Elisa Ferreira, Vicky Ford, Sylvie Goulard, Diogo Feio and Carl Haglund, as well as the shadow rapporteurs who all played a major part in the negotiations."
"The Chair, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs have all represented this House with great distinction."
"I also highly appreciate the outstanding role played by State Secretary András Kármán, who represented the Hungarian Presidency with such skill and determination."
"And I dare to say that I am very proud of my team in the Commission and I will thank them once we have reached the destination, with your help of course."
"I warmly welcome the texts that you have finalised."
"In the course of the trilogues, Parliament's negotiators have improved the Commission's proposals in many important respects."
"And you have gained a good many important improvements from the Council."
"The Commission supports the texts which you are about to vote on, and we can welcome and agree on all of your amendments."
"As we know, the Council agrees with almost all of them."
"But it did so with some exceptions which present quite a challenge - let me come back to that in a moment."
"There is no time to set out all the gains made by Parliament in these negotiations: my staff have made me a summary list of no less than 50 major improvements won by you."
"For instance, you have codified the European Semester, you have set up a structured economic dialogue, providing for a prominent role for Parliament throughout the European Semester."
"You have achieved the opportunity for detailed discussion of country-specific situations at every key decision-making stage of the policy cycle, including confirmation of Parliament's right to initiate dialogue with individual Member States."
"In all parts of the legislation you have won a better information flow to Parliament and more transparency."
"You have got a commitment from the Commission to do a study on euro securities within six months of the entry into force of this legislation."
"This will be accompanied by a Commission declaration, the text of which you have seen, setting out the scope for that report."
"I will come back to that as well. The Commission will also commit itself in this declaration to reviewing the intergovernmental nature of the European Stabilisation Mechanism by mid-2014."
"You have got reverse qualified majority voting in a number of important cases - to improve the automaticity of decision-making - as the rule in the corrective arm of the Pact, where 24 Member States out of 27 now find themselves unfortunately."
"You have also won an equal role for Parliament in determining the scoreboard for detecting possible macroeconomic imbalances, and you have inserted firm guarantees on social dialogue, respect for national traditions on collective agreements, wage formation, and the role of social partners, which we fully share."
"There are going to be tough fines for statistical fraud and guarantees of independence for national statistical authorities."
"You have introduced earlier sanctions in the excessive imbalances procedure."
"I could go on and on."
"In your first legislative encounter with Ecofin as a co-legislator in economic policy, you achieved almost all of your most important objectives."
"This is a very good result for Parliament and for Europe."
"On euro securities, in the context of this package I will only confirm what I said at the trilogue on 15 June."
"The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the setting up of a system of common issuance of European sovereign bonds, or euro securities, under joint and several liability, in line with Article 8a(5) of the regulation on the enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area and within six months of the entry into force of that Regulation."
"These euro securities would aim to strengthen fiscal discipline and increase stability through markets as well as, by taking advantage of the increase in liquidity, ensuring that the Member States enjoying the highest credit standards would not suffer from higher interest rates."
"The report will, if appropriate, be accompanied by legislative proposals."
"In other words, in our view such a report on euro securities goes hand in glove with and only makes sense with the prospective reinforcement of economic governance in line with this package now under deliberation."
"Let me say a few words on the next steps."
"I am worried."
"Should the package not be agreed, neither the Council nor Parliament should think that they can successfully shift the responsibility onto the other."
"That will not work."
"People watching the decision-making from outside are not interested in the smallest detail."
"If we fail - and I say we and I really mean us all - they will simply say that 'Europe' has failed."
"Europe would fail and people's trust in the capacity of Europe to address their real problems would suffer a huge blow."
"Moreover, neither institution should imagine even for a moment that - whether for tactical or substantive reasons - they might get a better deal in the second reading."
"The Presidency has very skilfully extracted compromises from the Council that would most likely not appear on the table again if a first reading agreement could not be achieved."
"Actually only one issue remains open: the scope of reverse qualified majority voting."
"I believe you are all aware of the efforts we have made."
"The Commission supports reverse qualified majority voting."
"So does the ECB and a number of Member States, but not all of them and not in all places."
"The Council has already agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in five out of six decisions where it is legally possible."
"On the remaining one, there is a disagreement between Parliament and the Council."
"I believe a solution can and must be found."
"Therefore I appeal to you to seek a constructive solution on the remaining point in the next few days and I appeal to the Council too, to respond with a constructive approach on their part."
"I can reassure you that the Commission will work until the last minute, the last second, to find a satisfactory solution."
"Reinforced economic governance in Europe is simply too important to fail on this final remaining issue."
"Let us recall that the Council is about to sign the treaty on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which focuses on correction."
"But the ESM will only complement the new framework for reinforced economic surveillance, which focuses on prevention and is of primary essence because it will substantially reduce the probability of crises such as we have experienced emerging in the future."
"Let me conclude with a simple message."
"If there is no agreement this week and no vote by the latest in July, it will be a very bad deal for Europe and for Europe's citizens."
"And it would only result in frustration, bitterness and a worse outcome for everyone if we must come back to these files in September."
"You have agreed on 99.9% of the substance."
"I now ask both sides to go the last few centimetres to reach an agreement with the other."
"It is of paramount importance, since this package really is the cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the crisis that is still ongoing."
"It is absolutely crucial for the credibility of the European Union to conclude the package before the summer break, and then move on and put it into effective use."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make three groups of points on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The first is that as we adopt this economic governance package, we must ensure that the whole of the Treaty of Lisbon is taken into account."
"According to the Treaty, taking into consideration objectives concerned with promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social welfare and combating social exclusion is a cross-cutting aim that applies to this economic governance package also."
"If I may say so, I sometimes get the impression that this aim has been relegated to a secondary priority."
"This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen for the whole package to be based not only on Article 121 of the Treaty, which deals with the coordination of economic policies, but on Article 148 also, which deals with employment policy in terms of coordination between the responsibilities of Member States and the European level."
"This is also why we feel that within the Union, the role of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) must be firmly guaranteed, on a par with that of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin)."
"For if - and this brings me to my second group of points - in revising the Stability and Growth Pact our only objective is the kind of governance that will satisfy the rating agencies, then we will be missing an important opportunity in the history of our economic and monetary union."
"History calls us today to take a much more overall view and to look closely at the purposes for which this economic governance is being put in place."
"Of course we need to reduce debt, but we also need to ensure that this economic governance helps to guarantee the success of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In this respect, we believe there are other approaches that could have been used."
"Commissioner, why is it that only spending on pensions can be given special treatment in your assessment of Member States' medium-term budget objectives?"
"Why is it that this special treatment cannot also be given to the investment in the future represented by spending on education, or the spending we need to undertake to combat social exclusion, a goal that you set and that we included in the Europe 2020 strategy?"
"Why is it that these aims and this kind of approach are not also applied to spending on research and development or infrastructures?"
"My third group of points relates to how macroeconomic surveillance is conducted."
"We consider it to be an essential outcome of this package, but this means it must be applied symmetrically."
"Ultimately, for us here in the European Parliament, there is a fundamental issue at stake."
"Mrs Ford spoke of it as a power struggle."
"It is not a power struggle, it is a question of democracy."
"If we want there to be European economic governance, there needs to be a space for public debate and for European democracy, in order for this European economic policy to work."
"In this respect, I have to say that your refusal and that of the Council to allow the European Parliament to participate in establishing macroeconomic indicators through delegated acts does not seem to me to be the right approach."
"for David Casa, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, Mr Casa has asked me to speak on his behalf because he is not able to be here at this time."
"Many of the amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been taken into account by the six-pack rapporteurs."
"We are sending the message that a society can only have a healthy economy when its members are able to contribute fully to its development."
"A healthy economy is the basis for a good level of employment and social policies, and vice versa, a good level of employment and social policies are preconditions for a healthy economy."
"Those Member States which had the most prudent fiscal policies and growth strategies are now performing best."
"This is the proof that fiscal stability leads to growth and employment."
"We need to respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is essential to achieve growth and jobs and to prevent the debt burden being placed on our children and future generations."
"We have to understand that every euro used in paying interest on the public debt is one which does not go towards investment in education, social security and other fields that provide a necessary environment for the good development of the economy and for the well-being of the people."
"Therefore it is essential that our indebtedness in the Member States is reduced as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are undoubtedly many reasons for the economic situation in which we currently find ourselves in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole, but two stand out in particular."
"Firstly, we were basically far too late in realising the direction in which Europe was sailing."
"Secondly, when we did realise it, the Council in particular refused for a long time to initiate the necessary measures - which are actually provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact - or to impose the necessary sanctions."
"To put it bluntly, it simply failed to pull the ripcord."
"The new regulation on macroeconomic surveillance should deal with these two problems."
"Firstly, the completely new system it provides should enable us to recognise macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage; and secondly, we should then be able to act quickly."
"We have developed a good scoreboard, albeit through long discussions."
"I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, for her positive cooperation in this connection."
"We need to ensure that immediate measures are taken to counter imbalances."
"That is precisely why it is necessary for a mechanism to be developed here that cannot be politically torpedoed."
"That is why the use of reversed qualified majority voting is so important and so fundamental for Parliament."
"If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels."
"That is more than likely necessary anyway in an economic and monetary union."
"Only when the citizens of Europe see that we are now acting effectively, that we have learnt from the mistakes we have made, will we be able to regain the trust that has currently been lost."
"I can assure you that my group will be supporting the Ferreira report tomorrow."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, you will not find many members in this room who disagree with the need to drag down debt and deficits to reasonable levels in the years ahead."
"My group certainly takes the view that we need to do that."
"This is not about political confrontation between fiscally virtuous or fiscally irresponsible Members in this House."
"The division between you and us and between progressives and conservatives here in the House is about how we return to sound public finances, at what economic and social cost, at what cost for the future ability of Europe to compete in a global market."
"You stick to the idea, Commissioner, that there is no alternative to your austerity-only agenda."
"We think that this is very wrong."
"In our view, your approach and that of the right-wing majority in the Council pose the biggest threat to the very future of the European idea because they are destroying the notion of belonging to a community, the notions of solidarity and cohesion."
"The vast majority of the millions who have lost their jobs during this crisis are unemployed still today."
"What message does the Council and Commission have for them?"
"Or for the millions whose jobs are in jeopardy or who are living in poverty?"
"What message for the hundreds of millions of people who are suffering as a result of cutbacks in public provision, in healthcare, in education?"
"What message for them?"
"What message from the Council this week?"
"Well, I expect nothing quite frankly, nothing."
"This week's Council will not produce a single ray of hope for hardworking people, for the unemployed or the young people who are hurting so much."
"They have been unfairly and severely hit by the crisis that was not of their making and now they will be hit again to repair the damage they did not cause."
"Your political and economic agenda is totally unacceptable to us on this side of the House."
"Throughout the legislative process, we have suggested sensible and balanced amendments to the Commission's proposals, we have proposed firmly connecting national reform and stability and growth programmes using the first as a solid vehicle for the necessary promotion of public investment We made proposals to maintain sensible levels of productive public investment and we have proposed making the new rules clearly anti-cyclical."
"I could go on, but the reality is that today's economic and social agenda has been hijacked by the right."
"There is not even space for moderate political approaches, let alone more progressive ones."
"And please, Commissioner Rehn, do not tell me that these policies I am denouncing are being pursued by socialist governments."
"You know, at a time when even the strongest economies in Europe need to bow to the demands of an irresponsible and increasingly dangerous financial sector, that no Member State can change this agenda alone."
"In the end, I wonder who will benefit from the decisions that will be made this week."
"It seems to me that the only people who will benefit are those who have caused the whole mess in the first place, the financial sector, and I think that is a disgrace."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, so far we have found agreement on almost all of the package and have demonstrated that codecision is working, with thanks to the hard work of the Hungarian Presidency and of course to András Kármán in particular, and to the Parliament negotiating team and the Commission."
"The Presidency and Commission have already highlighted numerous - I think it was 50 - Parliament additions."
"These include a legal framework for the Semester and surveillance of national reform programmes, independence of national statistical offices and fines for fraud, Commission surveillance missions, an economic dialogue between all stakeholders, and substantially greater transparency throughout."
"We cannot conceal, though, that there have been significant differences in the negotiation of the package."
"For my part, I do not see this as political grandstanding but rather the search for ownership, to enable ownership by the people."
"What divides us in Parliament differs from our issues with the Council but, however difficult it may be, we have to stand up to our democratic duty."
"It is this House that will confer ownership."
"Some prefer intergovernmentalism."
"Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense."
"Nor does it make sense in the search for ownership - so distinctly missing in much of the response to the crisis and so much a consequence of intergovernmental decisions."
"From the realisation that the Stability Fund facilities had to be larger, to recognising the fact that punitive interest rates do not give sustainability and the chance to return to the markets, this House has not been afraid to lead and the Council has followed."
"We are stronger when we work together and I believe the final differences can be resolved."
"Mr President, the package of six proposals intended to improve discipline within the euro area is based on the belief that the Member States will comply more rigorously with the newly created and stricter architecture for supranational surveillance."
"I regard it as problematic to think along these lines, particularly since some Member States have been incapable of following the less stringent rules to date, and effectively enforcing their implementation."
"I would like to mention four points which I consider controversial."
"The first is reverse qualified majority voting, which has already been referred to many times in this Chamber."
"We regard reverse qualified majority voting as an instrument to be used in exceptional cases, the use of which must always be explained properly and thoroughly, with proper checks carried out to ensure that its use is consistent with primary law."
"We do not agree with the increase in the number of areas subject to surveillance procedures for which the use of reverse qualified majority voting is proposed."
"The proposed approach will increase the political power of the Commission and the European Parliament to the detriment of the Council and the national authorities, which is not what we want."
"With regard to surveillance missions, I have serious reservations concerning the proposal for such missions, since they will be composed mainly of European Commission officials and will have significant powers entrusted to them, without the members of these missions having any political mandate."
"This is a fundamental reservation."
"People who are not subject to public control by voters, however good their intentions may be, cannot carry out surveillance over the heads of national political bodies or the highest national institutions."
"The scoreboard, which attempts to draw up a list of macroeconomic indicators at supranational level and, based on this list, to assess the ability of national authorities and their economies to deal with economic imbalances, is a contentious idea."
"The current situation in Greece is a good example of the fact that solutions to a situation dictated from outside provoke opposition from the country's inhabitants, and are one of the causes of escalating social tension."
"Mr President, the Greens want economic governance."
"Not just to please people, not so that it will make a nice photo, but simply to give the European people instruments, by building on the euro, that will enable them to meet the challenges of the 21st century, in other words to ensure a decent standard of living for everyone, not just for the happy few, and to do it within the planet's physical limitations - and this is what is new, of course."
"In this respect, we support these reports on the budget frameworks and the macroeconomic component of the 'economic governance' package."
"We are satisfied with all the indicators that have been selected, even though we would have liked one of them to have been income inequalities, as they are a very clear sign of both a poorly functioning economy and a poorly functioning society and should therefore act as a warning sign."
"However, our agreement on the macroeconomic component is conditional upon maintaining a symmetrical approach, and this is a point I make to the Council."
"In other words, we believe that all the Member States should be in the same boat, whether they have a current deficit or a surplus, for example."
"There is no reason why we should apply favouritism, as one country's surplus is another country's deficit."
"As regards the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot accept an instrument whose only outcome is and will remain austerity, austerity and more austerity, in other words which will result in making only the most vulnerable in our societies pay for the economic crisis."
"We wanted balance, not by having less budget discipline but by combining it with disciplined investment."
"Our proposal was to make the goals that Europe set itself with the EU 2020 strategy not only binding, but as binding as each other and as binding as the rules on the budget or on deficits."
"I am disappointed that a majority could not be found in this Parliament to finally back this strategy and take it more seriously."
"We might have agreed to vote in favour of this stability and growth package unchanged had it been accompanied by an ambitious fiscal package, combining a financial transaction tax, an energy tax, a fair tax on transnational corporations and, of course, measures to combat tax fraud, so that we could help the Union's Member States fund the goals they hope to achieve."
"However, there was not the slightest sign of this."
"There is absolutely nothing in the pipeline, despite the declarations that Mr Barroso has made again today."
"I say this to the right: you chose to form a narrow majority with the eurosceptics, as you were free to do, in order to create a form of economic governance which I can tell you now is unfair and will be ineffective."
"We will see what happens, therefore, either in this Parliament when your pact with the eurosceptics has fallen through, or at the polls in France in 2010 and in Germany in 2013, where I think the voters will agree with us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009."
"However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table."
"For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries."
"For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market."
"Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets."
"None of this is to be found in the economic governance package."
"Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe."
"As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole."
"This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe."
"The much-needed improvements on the Commission's original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there - particularly in Mrs Ferreira's report - have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council."
"In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable."
"As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with."
"This is reserved for the Commission."
"It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future."
"In our view, the economic governance package - at least in its present form - is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form."
"Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, when the euro was introduced it may not have been clear what the loss of monetary policy might involve for a Member State."
"Today we are seeing the dramatic consequences in Greece."
"The euro area was not and has not become an optimal currency zone."
"A country hit by the financial crisis finds it more difficult to recover and could well drag other Member States into the abyss."
"From Maastricht onwards, criteria have existed which are designed to prevent dangerous situations, and we have seen how miserably they have failed."
"In 1999 Greece did not meet any criteria, and only two years later it was already in the euro."
"Portugal, moreover, was the first country to receive warnings in 2002 about its deficit position."
"Even in the past, then, there were signs, but now all European citizens could end up paying the consequences."
"We are waiting to see, therefore, whether these new measures prove any more useful."
"They are probably the last chance before the definitive failure of European economic policy is declared."
"(DE) Mr President, the drama surrounding the European Union is turning into a tragedy."
"Tomorrow it will probably come down to every last vote."
"As someone directly elected by 500 000 voters in Austria, how can I endorse this package?"
"We can now explain the concept of economic governance even to highly eurosceptic people, but not if it has no democratic legitimacy and there are no checks and balances."
"How is it supposed to work if, on the one hand, a protectorate is de facto established - Greece - and on the other the taxpayers in better-off nations have their bonds plundered via the European Central Bank and the bad banks?"
"How can you explain to people who were adamant that they should not give up the schilling and the mark that we now suddenly need Eurobonds simply because the banks cannot be kept in check - by the way, Mr Hughes, it is very nice that the social democrats have now realised this."
"The only way I can imagine that is if we finally give in and say we should have done this, that or the other at the time; if we admit our mistakes and, as Europe burns around us, finally put forward a vision in which we are able to survive globalisation."
"I do not see this in the current package, however, and that is why - quite apart from individual points - it is so difficult for any responsibly-minded person to vote for it."
"(LV) Mr President, it is the case that homes are typically designed by people with higher education, but are typically built by people who barely have secondary education."
"What is more, if, during the construction of a home, there happens to be a building worker who is either foolish or dishonest, and does not pour the necessary amount of concrete into the foundations as called for in the design, then the home will be crooked."
"In the case of the eurozone, the foundations, the stability foundations, were laid with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Unfortunately it has come to pass that various Member States - perhaps like lazy or careless building workers - did not adhere to the stability pact and created excessively large government debts, budget deficits."
"When the world economic crisis came about, this eurozone house began to totter."
"If the eurozone were a house, then logically, we should have to set to work again and lay new foundations."
"In this case we have a completed economic governance package, which we should approve, in the way of reinforced foundations, so that in the future, when the next storm comes along, the eurozone cannot totter."
"In addition, if we want to have some idea of what this tottering looks like, we need only look at events in Greece."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to avoid the situation where in the future our house could totter once more, and the solution is to approve the economic government package. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to begin my comments with a question to Commissioner Rehn and to Mr Kármán of the Council."
"Both have spoken of an outstanding matter in the argument between the parliamentary majority and the Council."
"This week I noted that the Council had opposed text in the report by Mrs Ferreira, the rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, concerning the symmetrical approach."
"Are you able to tell me that this problem has been resolved, because the Council voted in favour of the rapporteur?"
"In actual fact, you would then still have a problem between the majority here and the Council - or did you forget to mention that?"
"If so, I should like to know that too, because then I would think that you consider it unimportant."
"I should like the two of you to explain this to me at the end of this debate."
"Listening to the two conservative groups in this House, and also to the liberals, I get the impression that if we adopt what they have tabled here then the world will be put to rights."
"Unfortunately, that is not the case."
"The world would subsequently be worse, not better - because they have turned an opportunity to create a more common economic policy in Europe into an austerity package."
"That is a bad thing, because it represents a policy that dates from the last century, because it represents an outdated approach which merely takes sanctions regimes from political techniques and not incentives, or smart taxation, or balanced approaches such as have been represented by us."
"Various sides of the House have made sufficient pragmatic proposals to allow a balanced package to be tabled."
"If Mrs Wortmann-Kool wants to claim that it would be blocked by the greens and the social democrats, that is of course simply nonsense."
"Exactly the opposite is true."
"To the Members of this House from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - who run after either the Commission or the Council - I would state that we are not here to let things through on the nod, but rather to think for ourselves."
"That is what the voters expect of us."
"I must therefore point out to you that at present you cannot tell whether a Member State is buying defence hardware, fighter aircraft or investing in its education system of tomorrow."
"You are not in a position to make a qualitative assessment of its budgetary policy."
"We do, in fact, want to equip you to do so."
"We wanted a smarter pact which provides greater opportunity for the Commission to have an influence."
"I cannot understand why Commissioner Rehn is not agreeing to this - more opportunities for influence and a modern economic policy which makes reference to the EU2020 objectives in the interests of our citizens."
"You have derailed it, and that is a pity."
"Consequently, this package is by no means balanced."
"We will continue to fight for a better economic package."
"We owe this to our electorate."
"In truth, the answer has to be 'more Europe', not 'less Europe'."
"It has to be the right Europe, however - not the wrong package."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is in a difficult situation, but it is precisely in times of crisis that the EU is usually able to take bold decisions."
"The fact that tomorrow we will be able to take a decision on stricter and clearer rules for economic governance is extremely important, not just for the countries within the euro area."
"Everyone will be affected."
"Europe's leaders have hesitated and created uncertainty."
"The nervousness has spread."
"Their message changed from day to day."
"The decision tomorrow will be able to demonstrate that Parliament is able to take difficult decisions in difficult times."
"Greece used deceit to enable it to join the euro area."
"That is true."
"That is precisely why the German and French leaders are now showing clear leadership and taking responsibility for Europe's future, rather than continuing to talk in unclear, muted tones."
"The Stability and Growth Pact must be reformed and the rules tightened up."
"Pacta sunt servanda - agreements must be kept - not a new Greece!"
"In Sweden, we know that the way to stability and growth is through healthy state finances."
"Mr Bullman can ask the Swedish members of his group."
"It is my hope that the Swedish Social Democrats will be able to support this proposal, particularly as we have managed to get rules through that safeguard the Swedish collective agreements."
"Now the last impediment is being removed to enable the Swedish Social Democrats to be instrumental in Sweden becoming a member of the Euro Plus Pact."
"If Sweden is to belong to the EU's inner circle, we cannot simply trudge along behind EU critics from Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom."
"That is not good company to keep."
"Mr President, I find myself in a difficult position in this debate as I believe that strong fiscal rules are necessary for a strong currency and a strong economy."
"This, I believe, was the fundamental reason why my country did not join the euro."
"Monetary union was always going to be difficult without significant steps towards economic union and it is this latter requirement which means I do not think the UK will ever join the euro."
"For my political group here in Parliament, national sovereignty over decisions on economic policy is a fundamental principle."
"If all six of these reports and their rules only apply to the euro zone, we would be able to more actively support the Euro Group in their decision to strengthen the principles that underpin their monetary union."
"If all the Member States who use the euro want to strengthen and deepen the coordination of their economic policies, then that should be their decision."
"The UK and other non-euro-zone countries want to be good neighbours."
"However, attempts to bind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and processes designed to harmonise economic policy are unacceptable."
"I do not wish to see the euro zone in prolonged difficulty, but the ECR cannot support EU legislation that transfers any further powers away from national governments who are currently outside of that euro zone."
"All Member States will hopefully have learned the lessons of the crisis, namely that a balanced budget and strong fiscal discipline are rewarded by lower funding costs in the financial markets, and that honesty in statistical reporting is essential for continued market confidence."
"Fundamentally, a strong euro zone and the euro as a global currency are in all of our interests."
"New rules need to ensure it is made stronger and more sustainable."
"(DE) Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to see strong European economic governance."
"This means that on the one hand we need strong rules for dealing with imbalances - as set out in Mrs Ferreira's report - and naturally we also need sanctions for these."
"That is why we will be voting in favour of these two reports, just as we will for the report by Mrs Ford, which provides the statistical basis for our economic cooperation."
"Likewise, as regards the three reports on the Stability and Growth Pact: a common euro, and in addition we need limits in Europe on deficits and debt."
"Such limits have been exceeded in this crisis."
"However, it is important to consider how the deficits and debt are reduced."
"At present we are seeing time and again in Greece, Portugal and Ireland that, under pressure from the European Commission, in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer, and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone."
"This has shaken people's faith in the process."
"That is why we in the Group of the Greens want the EU2020 objectives to be fully binding in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the reports, and also the deficit and debt objectives."
"In not accepting this, ladies and gentlemen of the liberal and conservative groups, you have opted out of one of the principles of social cohesion in Europe."
"We cannot support that."
"We consider it highly regrettable, because we would have liked to have seen a broad pro-European majority here in Parliament."
"If these reports do not get a majority tomorrow then we are always prepared to work together constructively to achieve a common solution for economic governance that takes social and economic responsibilities equally seriously."
"(EL) Mr President, for us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, this economic governance package is not only the wrong response to the crisis; it also marks the end of Europe as we know it."
"Its objective is not economic coordination and fiscal discipline, as it maintains; it is to impose a permanent austerity memorandum throughout Europe, on all the workers."
"The objective of the 'European semester' and national stability and reform programmes is not convergence; it is to abolish collective agreements, liberalise redundancies, privatise industry and do away with public pension systems."
"These policies do not serve the interests of the people of Europe or their hope of real growth."
"On the contrary, they serve the interests of the banks, which have knowingly kept toxic bonds subject to large-scale international speculation on their books, and the interests of large corporations which have found, in the common market, a haven for speculation and tax evasion."
"I would mention, by way of example, the German company Hochtief, which manages Athens Airport; it has not paid a euro since 2001 and owes EUR 500 million in VAT."
"There is a great deal of discussion about Greece."
"For a year now, the essence of the economic governance package has been applied to my country with disastrous consequences: the recession is getting worse, inflation has gone through the roof, investments have completely dried up, labour rights and collective agreements have basically been repealed, the biggest drop in the cost of labour has been in Europe, unemployment has reached 20% and debt has increased, fuelling a dangerous vicious circle of recession, debt and more borrowing."
"That is why angry Greek workers have taken to the streets and squares, fighting to get austerity policies overturned, to defend their income and to defend their labour and social rights, real growth and a better future for Greece and Europe."
"(ES) Mr President, we aspire to the creation of an economic government area subject to the principles of federalism, albeit adapted to the process of European integration."
"We can no longer close our eyes to the situation."
"There is an inconsistency in having a common currency but lacking the fiscal and financial instruments needed alongside it."
"Specifically, we need: the issuance of common European bonds, the outright rejection of competition between the bonds issued by the different Member States, the establishment of a genuinely European treasury and the harmonisation of fiscal policies to ensure equality, combat tax fraud and help to define a progressive European social policy based on efficient public services."
"Some may say these ideas are elementary."
"They must nonetheless be repeated time and again because nobody listens to them."
"It is for this very reason, that is to say not listening, that we are living in dark times, as anticipated by the poet Bertolt Brecht."
"(ES) Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament."
"However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible."
"It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need."
"A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible."
"Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups."
"However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so."
"Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission's proposal, the Council's position and what is now on the table - which will be put to the vote tomorrow - if they are examined objectively."
"This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow."
"At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn."
"By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static."
"Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same."
"This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans."
"It is not responsible at this juncture to say 'I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day'."
"Responsibility means walking."
"Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow's vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July."
"As another poet used to say - Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry - poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned."
"We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone."
"Thank you, Mr President, and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour, giving me more time."
"(MT) The six reports on economic governance amount to a complex package for the European Union, especially for the eurozone."
"Those who put the package together find it hard enough to explain and it is even harder for people on the outside to understand it."
"It is understandable that people are perplexed, both by the crisis that is unravelling before them, and by our unclear and timid reaction to it."
"This is why the responsibility lies with us to explain our voting choices to our constituents; to say whether we are for or against each and every one of these reports."
"Briefly, the package which the Commission presented us with was intended to cover the three phases of how one should react to the crisis."
"Primarily, this package focuses on crisis prevention, mitigation and solution."
"The Wortmann-Kool, Feio and Goulard report discuss the use of sanctions at length as the main tools required to prevent a country from reaching dangerous deficit and debt levels, and the scenarios that arise when these countries ignore the various warnings issued to them on their dire fiscal situation."
"Originally, the reports squabbled over the severity of the fines that should be imposed, although later on more moderate suggestions were accepted."
"The hardest and more creative way of mitigating the crisis, by avoiding macroeconomic imbalances through the use of scoreboards that determine the targets to be reached, was left to the Ferreira report."
"Despite technical restrictions and other pressures, this report managed at least to attain a minimum set of desired objectives."
"Anyone hoping to find a solution to the current crisis within this package will be doing so in vain."
"This package lacks well thought out, sensible ideas by European and foreign economists on how the affected countries can overcome this crisis."
"One report that made an effort to build a consensus on securities for the euro was side-lined at the last minute by the Council and has now simply been shelved by the Commission, accompanied by a promise to carry out further studies on the subject."
"We have nothing in hand that is concrete; we have merely ended up with a promise unto a promise."
"We must keep in mind that the whole point of this exercise was to help Europe get back to its feet, to pull it out of the mire and to ensure that it can move forward and become globally competitive."
"For this reason, we should not oppose the idea that eurozone countries need to reduce their excess fiscal burdens."
"We agree that nobody should compete while carrying around such a heavy burden."
"However, one cannot accept the imposition of a crash diet that would only serve to further sicken and weaken."
"Europe needs to build some economic muscle; it needs creative schemes in order to strengthen economic growth and create jobs."
"It is greatly disappointing that after all these months, not one of the intelligent proposals that were on the cards ended up in this package."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time we believed that the internal market and the introduction of a common currency would automatically result in economic convergence and convergence of the Member States, and that the Maastricht criteria were sufficient to ensure discipline."
"Reality has now caught up with us."
"The management instruments have proved to be inadequate and in the past they have been grossly transgressed."
"A single currency and a single monetary policy are not feasible in the long term unless the rules have teeth in the area of fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy."
"The EU is now trying a new approach."
"To speak metaphorically, it has one last shot."
"If this last shot fails to hit the target, the damage could be severe."
"The EU could find itself in a regressive phase, we could see the return of renationalisation and protectionism, and the first signs of disintegration in the euro area."
"The new package attempts to prevent this and to lay a new foundation."
"I am in favour of this package, even though I consider it rather half-hearted in view of the problems that I have just outlined."
"There is a risk that the European semester will turn out to be a centralist, bureaucratic exercise."
"The pact for the euro may possibly be toothless."
"What we need are binding recommendations from the Commission."
"What we need are automatic initiatives and sanctions which the Council can only stop by means of reversed qualified majority voting."
"This is undoubtedly necessary if the disgraceful, opaque wrangles by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end."
"What we urgently need is a clear resolution mechanism for the financial sector so that it can work again."
"(NL) Mr President, it has become clear that a monetary union requires a budgetary union, as well as compliance with the rules."
"That is the lesson to be learned from the euro crisis."
"I find the package we agreed last Wednesday to be very well balanced and I therefore have the honour to inform you, Commissioner, that the Belgian delegation within the European Conservatives and Reformists will be endorsing this package."
"I do have some points of criticism, however."
"On the whole, I think that Eurobonds are not a miracle solution."
"Yesterday, Gideon Rachman wrote in the Financial Times that you cannot cure alcohol poisoning with a bottle of vodka."
"I have had theological debates on this issue with Mrs Goulard."
"We could not agree, but I admire her as an opponent."
"I also think that the theory of economic imbalances is rather vague and unclear."
"It is not true that Germany has a trade surplus because Portugal has a trade deficit."
"That really would read like 'EU economics for dummies'."
"Therefore, Mr President, we have before us the best text achievable."
"I will vote in favour of it and I think that, at this moment and in this period of crisis in the euro area, we and this Parliament are being called upon to deliver and that is what I would like to do."
"(EL) Mr President, the package of economic governance measures creates an strong tool for imposing capitalist restructurings in a uniform manner and a uniform strategy in all the Member States, in order to strengthen the competitiveness, profitability and power of capital."
"This is a permanent memorandum for the working classes in all the Member States of the European Union."
"The vulgar propaganda about Greece's, Ireland's, Portugal's and other countries' debts and deficits is designed to blame the rights acquired by the working classes and to conceal the real culprit, which is capitalism and its monopolies."
"The ideological terrorism of the bourgeois class being promoted is that the only way out is to slaughter the workers so as to keep the profitability of capital intact."
"Between 1985 and 2011 alone, apart from the immeasurable wealth appropriated by capital from exploiting the working class in Greece, monopoly capital at home and abroad plundered EUR 628 billion in interest and repayments, either as lender or borrower."
"The working class owes nothing to those who have robbed them of what they earned by the sweat of their brow."
"On the contrary, they are owed all the wealth plundered by capital."
"The message sent out by the Greek Communist Party from the rock of the Acropolis echoes more topically than ever today: 'Nations of Europe arise."
"(DE) Mr President, the more we guarantee in the future European stabilisation mechanism, the more dependent the sound states become on the overindebted periphery of the EU."
"Centralisation and a single currency, which could never be a hard currency in the long term, have contributed to the current problems, yet a continuation along this wrong path is precisely what is now being proposed to us as a solution to rescue us."
"Economically strong and weak economies are first arbitrarily thrown together in the same pot."
"Then we make recourse to various rescue measures - all in vain - and now the whole thing is to culminate in European economic governance."
"In my opinion, if overindebted economies want to remain in the euro area then they must be subjected to strict budgetary control instead."
"The sort of centralisation which takes the form of Brussels exerting budgetary authority over all the Member States represents improper intervention in the sovereignty of the Member States, however, and would moreover reduce the sound countries of Europe to mere playthings of EU bureaucracy."
"In my opinion, we should be bolting the door against Brussels' creeping desire for ever more centralisation."
"Mr President, our task and responsibility here is to ensure that both Member States and the Union as a whole emerge stronger from the crisis, and the economic governance package takes us in this direction."
"The package - politically unthinkable prior to the crisis and certainly not yet perfect - is indeed a major step forward."
"It is obvious, however, that to get an agreement is one thing - and it is our duty here - but to see its practical implementation and then to benefit from new rules will be yet another challenge."
"This reform, introducing a greater amount of automaticity over political bargaining and discretion, will have to pass the test of real life and this will require a strong political will and an attitude of accountability."
"It is unclear how long it will take before all the institutional arrangements are in place and new rules start bearing their fruit."
"This uncertainty creates risks and we must not create additional space for these risks."
"It also remains unclear how the interplay between the European Semester and the new economic governance infrastructure will function, and I also have concerns about the permanent European Stability Mechanism emerging as an intergovernmental tool."
"I hope that our agreement on the six-pack will pave the way for these instruments to be eventually converted into the Community-based ones."
"To conclude, let me say that the economic governance package gives us a chance that the winner/loser attitude will disappear from our European reality and that Europe will not become a zero sum game."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens are questioning the merits of austerity policies that are reducing their public services and squeezing their social security."
"Wherever these policies are rife, they are not succeeding in reducing public debt and bringing down unemployment."
"The contents of this 'governance' package - and I call them 'contents' deliberately - that we are discussing today are so ridiculous that even the economists are stunned, because they will prevent budgetary policy from adjusting to economic cycles."
"During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations."
"They admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis."
"In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission."
"They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective: is that not right, Mr Gauzès?"
"They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits."
"Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned!"
"Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State's creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today's investments are tomorrow's jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits."
"This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the 'governance' package."
"My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros."
"They also want to punish countries that will not lower wages in order to regain their external balance."
"They believe that the deficits are primarily the product of bad intentions on the part of those States, as though the neoliberal model that you never question had not just been through its worst crisis since 1929, and as if it were not already leading to pressure on the buying power of ordinary people and causing a massive contraction in tax income: two problems that were at the root of the rise in private and public indebtedness in the first place."

"This clear signal is aimed at all workers in Europe and especially at our fellow citizens in France and Germany as they approach elections that will have a decisive impact on Europe's future."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for the great job they have done, especially my colleagues and friends Sylvie Goulard and Carl Haglund."

"Not only through its direct consequences, but also by the moral stand that we show our citizens."
