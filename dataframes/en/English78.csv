"We hope that it will help attract our young generation of graduates to the research professions."
"The decision not to determine the final form to be taken by the ERC was taken out of a concern to bring the Council into operation no later than by 1 January 2007 and to seek to make it as effective as it possibly can be."
"That is why our Parliament wishes, within the framework of the codecision process, to be fully involved in taking the decision on the definitive form to be taken by the Council."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs to achieve a faster rate of growth and, to that end, it has set its sights on knowledge, which means research, training, information, development of ICT, and so forth."
"Perhaps the most ambitious objective that we have set ourselves is the seventh framework programme, which today represents the European added value that is essential if we are to achieve that result."
"I shall confine myself to addressing two aspects of it."
"In this impressive programme we have endeavoured to ensure broad access, which is not the opposite of selectivity but is, rather, a precondition for it."
"We want all components of the research world to be in a position to take part, and I am referring not least to women scientists."
"What I have just said also applies to the production components, starting with small and medium-sized enterprises, which have a vital need for innovation but require particular attention."
"I refer to the procedures issue: in that respect let us call on the Commission to ensure that the efforts to simplify, to facilitate and to support SMEs are not lost during the implementation phase, but rather increased."
"The second aspect concerns research, which has clear and unavoidable ethical facets."
"It would take crass cynicism or a purely scientistic outlook for anyone to ignore these aspects."
"It is therefore quite right to acknowledge them and, if possible, to find solutions that take account of these facets, which relate to human beings and their dignity."
"There is one important issue in particular on which we are split within the various groups."
"Within my own group as well, there is a position on embryonic stem cells, albeit a minority one like the one that I represent."
"None of us wants to stop science, but many of us believe that respect for life should be a guideline anyway, although it is not intended as a restriction, and that, where there is scientific doubt, it is appropriate to adopt the precautionary principle."
"The Community resources allocated for that purpose, which are already very limited, could be more usefully concentrated in those sectors where research has already been developed and which therefore now promise benefits for human health in the near future, such as the use of adult stem cells and other alternatives, leaving all other fields of research development to individual Member States."
"These are cross-cutting positions that also require an ability to listen to and to respect others."
"When subjects that affect people and human life so intimately are addressed in these Chambers, which are more used to debates on the economy or other more tangible subjects, I believe we need a little more wisdom and perhaps a little more listening and dialogue."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is still held back by archaic and dangerous technologies such as nuclear, which it would be good to get rid of, so it would be somewhat strange if it imposed a kind of veto on researching and applying new technologies that may prove fundamental in saving the lives of many people through the use of stem cells."
"It is not a question of not having an important ethical position on these subjects."
"In fact I am against human cloning."
"It is a different thing to try to impose ideological and preconceived viewpoints that compromise not only research and science but above all everyone’s right to their own life."
"The European Parliament has a right but also a duty to meet these expectations in full."
"Therefore, a project for Europe is also taking shape around this research programme."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has supported the adoption of the seventh framework programme in the knowledge that the challenge to improve the competitiveness and development of nations throughout the continent depends on the revitalisation of research opportunities."
"I believe, however, that the financial effort should be increased."
"If 3% of investment in the European Union is channelled into research and development by 2010, it will perhaps be possible to reduce the shortfall of about 700 000 researchers that the Union currently suffers."
"Public funding for research remains necessary in sensitive sectors such as health, energy and the environment, and I believe there is considerable agreement on that in Parliament."
"Such funding cannot come solely from the European institutions, however."
"On the contrary, they must press the national governments to increase the financial appropriation for research in their budgets and thus improve working conditions in the area, as regards both the possible development of human resources in the public sector and the promotion of private investment and public-private partnerships."
"The problems of research and development are not the same across Europe."
"Working conditions vary, as do the prospects for young researchers and for their transition from academic studies to the job market."
"In Italy, for instance, the relationship between universities and businesses does not provide proper training and apprenticeship opportunities."
"There is not even a basic exchange of information."
"The low rates of pay and limited funding for research drive researchers to emigrate or, more often, to abandon public research in order to try more rewarding paths to personal fulfilment."
"That is a further reason why I hope that creating the European Research Council can fill the gaps in the national systems."
"The very large number of amendments tabled on this already excellent report by Mr Buzek attests to the interest and importance that Parliament attributes to research for the development of our continent."
"Mr President, I too would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, who has been very fair and inclusive in the way he has steered this difficult proposal through Parliament."
"I accept that the ethical issues are a very difficult area: embryonic stem cell research, somatic nuclear cell transfer technology and genetic therapies for hereditary diseases."
"I respect the differing views and deeply-held beliefs concerning these issues."
"It is clearly an issue of personal conscience and belief, for which the only acceptable procedure is a free vote is this Parliament, which represents all Europe citizens."
"I should like to explain why a Christian can accept EU funding of this research."
"Jesus Christ related the parable of the Good Samaritan."
"It was the despised Samaritan who did not pass by on the other side as others had."
"He stopped to aid a fellow man who was in difficulty."
"God endowed humans with the intelligence and skills to improve our human lot, and over the centuries, often in the face of resistance from church hierarchies and doctrines, mankind has challenged the frontiers of science and thereby improved our wellbeing."
"The research in this area, which is funded by the European Union, is in that tradition."
"However, it is restricted by rules, recognises human dignity, and is closely monitored and regulated."
"In my view, and that of many Christians, including the Christian church to which I belong, it is wholly appropriate that we continue to fund this research, just as we did under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research and development are a crucial prerequisite for our prosperity, since we in Europe now have to live off producing knowledge and ideas."
"The Framework Programme for Research is therefore an important tool for enabling the EU to cope successfully with international competition in the future."
"No EU country can by itself mobilise the critical mass needed for competing with China or the United States but, together, the EU countries can mobilise the resources for entering into competition with them."
"Moreover, it is precisely in the diversity we have in Europe that we shall find an important key to greater creativity."
"I am pleased that higher priority is being given to the international dimension of the Framework Programme than it was in the case of the Sixth Framework Programme."
"International cooperation is no longer a separate part of the programme but, rather, is integrated horizontally into the individual themes and special programmes."
"We are thus adapting research to what is actually happening globally."
"I hope that this prioritisation will also be reflected in the number of international projects."
"Europe’s peripheral areas are currently undergoing depopulation, and it is imperative for us to maintain research in the outermost regions by creating attractive working conditions for researchers."
"I am therefore pleased, too, that it is now possible to coordinate efforts made under the Seventh Framework Programme and in the context of the Regional Fund."
"This makes it possible to build regional partnerships between research institutions, the public authorities and enterprises, so giving a powerful shot in the arm to regional development."
"The time is past when researchers could sit in their ivory towers."
"It is more important than ever before that the dissemination aspect be integrated into research."
"If society is to reap as many of the benefits of European research as possible, we must ensure that the results of research make a difference to individuals, authorities and trade and industry."
"High-quality research dissemination helps people see society’s investment in research as something legitimate."
"Energy research has become a thematic priority of its own within ‘cooperation’."
"There is a great need for research in energy technologies, which can help Europe achieve its objectives in terms of energy policy within ..."
"Mr President, it is a very important decision that Parliament has to take this week in order to realise the Lisbon goals and reconcile welfare and environmental responsibility with global competitiveness."
"The basis for this is a truly excellent proposal from Commissioner Potočnik and an excellent report by rapporteur Buzek."
"Unfortunately, the Council has made it harder for us, in terms of budgeting, to live up to the expectations and ambitions that we in the larger political groups share."
"I welcome the setting up of Excellence Networks and the simplification of bureaucracy."
"I believe that there is a problem with the uncertainty that still remains in respect of the European Research Council."
"The review of all of the material which is to take place in order to finally clarify the position of the European Research Council should be fixed to take place in 2008."
"It is also important that we have tabled amendments relating to small and medium-sized enterprises and to participants from and participation by various groups around Europe."
"Where women are concerned, we know that discrimination still occurs in every Member State in the field of research and development, both in relation to content and to participation."
"I am also of the belief that the technology platforms will be of enormous benefit to European industry."
"The issue that has generated the greatest number of problems is stem cell research."
"I can verify that the system we currently have in place functions excellently."
"The research that is taking place on the basis of this technique is extremely important for the work of coming to grips with the big endemic diseases, diabetes, rheumatism, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, these being diseases that affect a large number of Europeans."
"It is our duty to make use of all the available tools in an ethical and responsible manner."
"If we are now in a position to help people, we must seize the opportunity."
"I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the proposal that has been adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Thank you."
"I would like to begin by welcoming Commissioner Potočnik and thanking rapporteur Buzek for his tireless cooperation and the information that he has given us."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work that he has done."
"The Seventh Research and Development Framework Programme is closely linked with the debate on the future of the European Union."
"This fact is set to become increasingly significant in the light of current global influences."
"In the coming decades the areas of demography and energy will be of exceptional importance for Europe, yet will also become the areas most ridden with problems."
"We have to define our objectives clearly, so that we can secure economic and social stability and preserve public welfare."
"However, we will only be able to do so if we can achieve a higher degree of interdependence between knowledge and development on the one hand and innovation on the other, and if we can make successful use of this correlation in the economy."
"Demography and energy must constitute the core of our future research in the European Union."
"Let me now return to the issue of energy, an area in which we face ever greater challenges in terms of secure supplies, energy dependency and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"All these areas call upon us to lay down a clear set of objectives, particularly medium and long–term, as it is here that Europe increasingly finds itself faced with a growing number of difficulties."
"With long–term planning in mind, fusion research and the construction of the ITER nuclear reactor project must take precedence, as this will open up new dimensions in the research of nuclear energy on a global scale."
"However, research into renewable energy sources and nuclear fission can offer an adequate response to our medium–term demands for secure, clean and competitive energy."
"Europe is currently a frontrunner in the energy sector, but we must bear one thing in mind nonetheless: if we wish to remain at the cutting edge of this sector in global terms, we have to view energy as a single, unified area, despite the fact that energy supplies have already been regulated in a number of European treaties."
"Of course, unified and clear objectives are not enough."
"They have to be followed up with adequate measures and it is here that I wish to stress the importance of staying ahead of the game."
"Our programme has to be ready in time so that we can establish a link in the crossover from the sixth to the seventh framework programme."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Buzek for his excellent work."
"We have said what we would like to see regarding the Seventh Framework Programme."
"We tabled as many as 1 700 amendments, so this would have been enough for an Eighth Framework Programme."
"The Scientific Council is one of the most significant new additions to the Framework Programme, and it will be the first genuine pan-European research funding institution."
"Its objective is top quality research and keeping scientists in work in the EU."
"There is a real need for support for top-quality research."
"There are 500 top-quality universities in the world, of which 200 are in Europe and another 200 in the United States, but only two European universities are in the top 20."
"If we here in Europe can afford to spend time on trivialities, we should also be able to afford top-quality research."
"We should also ensure that good use is made of the fruits of research."
"The gulf between research, innovation and the launching of new products is too wide."
"The Union’s research programme should also be used to remove obstacles to cooperation between Member States."
"Article 169 of the Framework Programme also provides a tool for strategic cooperation between the Member States, and that is what we need."
"It is intolerable that the research budget should have been cut by EUR 20 billion now that we are moving towards an information economy, for which we need research."
"We will not become the world’s leading information economy in this way."
"Our investment programme is lagging behind both the United States and Japan."
"In the information and communications sector we have succeeded in creating a good number of commercial applications."
"Information and communications account for 8% of European GDP and 6% of employment."
"We have, however, put up obstacles such as intricate patent legislation, which is eroding our competitiveness."
"A civilised Europe must boost its position with the help of research and product development and, for example, information and communications technology."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in thanking Mr Buzek and start with a very positive anecdote about the European Research Framework Programme."
"At the beginning of the debate in committee, I brought together representatives of all the universities and of the business community in my region, in order to discuss the framework programme with them."
"This discussion naturally also brought to light criticism relating to bureaucracy and to SMEs having insufficient access to the framework programme."
"After a great deal of criticism had been expressed, a professor who had been involved in the framework programme for years spoke up, saying that we should not look at only the negative points: the Americans envied us this instrument."
"Although things are by no means perfect now, we should not run the framework programme down."
"The report by Mr Buzek addresses many of the criticisms."
"Good proposals have been made in the fields of SMEs and bureaucracy, which we should support in plenary."
"I consider this a good report on the whole, but there is one point with which I am not in agreement – and this will not surprise you. I do not support Amendment 66 to Article 6."
"This Amendment calls for EU funding for research that includes destructive research with human embryos."
"This has been banned at national level in ten countries, in some cases following very intensive discussions, in some cases following a referendum."
"The amendment also includes a revision clause."
"If this revision clause takes effect, cloning for research purposes could also be possible in the course of the framework programme – yet this is permitted in only three countries of the EU."
"After all, it is not the case that there is too much money within the framework programme – many good, uncontroversial projects are being rejected."
"Since the subject of Alzheimer’s disease has been mentioned, I can say that, a few weeks ago, a meeting was held with the leading European researcher in the field of Alzheimer’s."
"He said that he had many innovative approaches to combating Alzheimer’s – but did not mention embryonic stem cell research as being one of them."
"For this reason, we should support the alternatives, but supporting Amendment 66 would mean that certain alternatives could not be promoted."
"For this reason, I ask you to reject Amendment 66."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to start by thanking Mr Buzek for his excellent work, and also the shadow rapporteurs, particularly Mr Busquin, who has brought a great deal of know-how and experience to bear."
"As regards the question of priorities, health policy and health research undoubtedly fall into this category."
"I disagree with Mr Liese here, as stem cell research, including embryonic stem cell research, is also potentially important as regards health, particularly in the fields in which adult stem cell research is not yet able to offer anything of equivalent value."
"I therefore consider this course of action to be of benefit, and it has my full support."
"A second field that has also been given higher priority, particularly by Parliament, is that of energy."
"We all know how important it is to make progress in the energy field, and I would emphasise once more how important it is for the large energy companies, whose large profits are chiefly a result of increases in oil and gas prices, to invest more in research."
"I hope that the Commissioner also ensures that more such private resources are brought in."
"It is important that the EU’s contribution to the field of energy, in particular, be made within the framework of the Research Framework Programme, or of nuclear research."
"The issue of nuclear research is very controversial, of course, as the issue of nuclear energy itself is controversial."
"If, however, there is one important field to which we must give absolute priority, it is the field of safety and security: safety with regard to plants, and security in the sense of creating all the technical and other possibilities for preventing proliferation for non-civil purposes – military or even terrorist."
"I would ask the Commissioner to take this very seriously, and to do more in this field, in particular."
"Mr Buzek has taken up some of my proposals – he could have taken up more – opinions differ on this – but I believe that absolute priority must be given to safety and security in the field of nuclear and energy research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and for the agreement that we have reached with a view to creating in this programme a specific line in favour of research into paediatric medicines."
"A lot of things have been said in the context of putting this programme in place. That is why I shall emphasise only three points."
"Firstly, and on the subject of ease of access, I recently met a number of SME managers who told me that research grants would have to be requested for the purpose of understanding precisely how Europe tackles the subjects it has to deal with."
"Behind the humour, there is a great truth: yes to rigour in responding to requests, but no to the host of indecipherable formulas."
"With regard, secondly, to the monitoring aspect, it is indeed necessary to strengthen this with a view to ensuring that the aid granted is effective and the funds properly used."
"We must act in accordance with these considerations."
"Finally, the third point concerns the priority that it is absolutely vital to give to sustainable development, health research and innovation."
"Where health research and, more specifically, embryonic stem cell research is concerned, I would emphasise that we have to move with the times."
"Yes, I am in favour of this research."
"Yes, I want us to be able to help researchers work in good conditions and, above all, with no date restrictions when it comes to selecting the cells concerned."
"Indeed, date restrictions would amount to hindering cutting-edge research."
"When voting, do not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that such research offers the possibility of identifying specific stem cell lines in order to find effective treatments."
"To reject these new lines of research would be to deprive those suffering from currently incurable diseases of the opportunity of a cure."
"By what right and under what law can we say to someone who is seriously ill: ‘No, Europe does not want anything to do with this research."
"If you had wanted to be treated, you should have been born in America.’"
"That, in point of fact, is where our problem lies."
"If we do not make up our minds and take action now, it will be the Americans and the Japanese who will do so in our place."
"Mr President, I would above all like to note the great importance of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7) for a small Member State, and especially for its young scientists."
"Taking into consideration the very poor condition of the scientific infrastructure in the new Member States, the funds of FP 7 will not be sufficient to liquidate this, but governments will have to significantly increase the budget allocated for science, at least in Estonia."
"A second issue I would like to raise is energy."
"I hope that the Council will support Parliament’s recommendation to spend, in the framework of FP 7, EUR 150 million more on energy-related research and development activities than the figure offered by the country currently holding the presidency."
"Of course, even this amount is minuscule considering the challenges of the energy sector."
"The majority of this amount, however, goes to nuclear energy and not to new sustainable technologies."
"I agree with the previous speakers who have already expressed their dissatisfaction about this matter."
"A disproportionate share goes to energy technologies based on fossil fuels."
"The same goes for Estonia, where oil shale research holds first place in terms of state funding."
"It is time to change these proportions!"
"First allow me to thank Mr Buzek for the truly excellent work he has done in drafting this report."
"I for one believe that, notwithstanding the budget cuts, the Seventh Framework Programme is set to substantially strengthen the research potential of all EU Member States without undermining the excellence principle."
"The economy of the European Union cannot afford to neglect this potential, which is not concentrated exclusively in large centres of research but nevertheless has the critical mass to attain excellence."
"Numerous regional universities, corporate research units and technology centres all generate substantial research potential in the form of young research workers who often look for opportunities outside the European Union."
"The largest obstacle to promoting this potential is the inadequate R [amp] D infrastructure which is a prerequisite for shaping and retaining scholars and researchers in remote regions."
"Conversely, not all major research centres are synonymous with excellence."
"We should not confuse the excellence principle with the centralising of research in large centres exclusively."
"Better exploitation of the research potential within the entire European space may, on the one hand, strengthen cooperation and, on the other, establish the necessary conditions for badly needed internal competition, which may significantly contribute to boosting the competitiveness of European research to global levels."
"I therefore believe that a financial contribution aimed at improving research infrastructure by tapping the budget of the Seventh Framework Programme and of structural funds in ‘cohesion regions’ that have fine research potential will become a meaningful investment and will generate the required synergy necessary to attain the Lisbon goals."
"In conclusion, permit me to make one very clear point."
"The European Union should not be funding embryonic stem cell research."
"During this debate, we have already heard quite a few sensible arguments in support of this higher principle."
"– Mr President, I should like to discuss a point to which the Commissioner referred: he expressed the hope that the Research Framework Programme would bring the Lisbon Agenda to the fore once again."
"I think he is absolutely right."
"Indeed, the advantage of the European Research Framework Programme and of the European research area is firstly that we can define our research identity in the European Union, and secondly that we can be part of international developments."
"Overall, these programmes are of course promoting the competitiveness of the European Union."
"There are currently quite a lot of difficulties regarding the issue of stem cell research."
"Some Members are attempting, in effect, to renationalise this area, whenever it is a matter of critical research."
"I think that is highly problematic."
"This kind of renationalisation would affect many areas of research in future, such as nuclear research, security research and many other areas where certain nation states have ethical or other concerns."
"I do not think we should do that."
"This kind of renationalisation would be highly damaging not only to the Lisbon Agenda but also to the European Union as a whole in future."
"I therefore hope that we will reach broad consensus on the Research Framework Programme."
"Congratulations to Mr Buzek, to our shadow rapporteurs and to Mr Busquin."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine myself to talking about the ethical issues."
"In order to comprehend these kinds of issues, we first of all need to understand what we are talking about."
"First, we must consider that it is not a question of deciding whether or not to authorise experimentation on embryos, but of deciding whether projects involving unavoidably destructive research can be financed by the European Union, in other words with money that comes partly from Member States that consider the destruction of embryos for experimental purposes to be a serious violation of fundamental rights."
"Secondly, we have to consider the foreseeable effects of the research."
"So far, embryonic stem cells have not been demonstrated to be therapeutically effective in any way."
"On the contrary, their carcinogenic effects on mice have been demonstrated."
"So far, not a single publication in the world has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of embryonic stem cells."
"On the other hand, so-called adult stem cells already cure numerous diseases and the prospects are extremely promising."
"That means that, if we really want to save people’s health, we must concentrate the little funding we have in areas where it is easier and quicker to achieve our purpose than elsewhere."
"Lastly, the principle of subsidiarity needs to be invoked."
"There are countries for which experimentation on embryos calls into question the very concept of human dignity and, therefore, the basis of human rights."
"Allowing experimentation on a human being means, in other words, regarding that human being as an object and not as a human being."
"Thus it is not a question of talking about labelling, tourism or town planning, but of the very basis of human rights as conceived, perhaps wrongly, by one country rather than another."
"I therefore do not believe it is right that the Member States that allow experimentation on embryos should be able to force the Member States that do not allow it to help pay for experimentation in the other countries."
"– I should like to highlight a few points."
"The first is the importance of research to the success of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Secondly, it is necessary to carry out and extend research into climate change and its impact on natural disasters."
"Research must also be carried out into solving the energy problem."
"In spite of all the controversy, embryonic stem cell research is a highly promising area of research that has yielded very encouraging results in terms of treating diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, which would not have been possible simply with adult stem cells or those from the umbilical cord."
"I therefore welcome the consensus proposal tabled by Mrs Gutiérrez and Mr Busquin and call on the Members of this House to support it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Seventh Research Framework Programme will contribute to making the European Union somewhat more competitive in our globalised world, but unfortunately only somewhat more."
"We have not reached many of the original targets, and we will not do so."
"To avoid any misunderstandings: under the given conditions, Mr Buzek and his colleagues have made the best of the programme, but research spending certainly has not been doubled."
"The clear increase in the budget in comparison with the Sixth Framework Programme is a step in the right direction, but we are still miles away from the doubling of the budget that was originally planned and is still urgently required."
"Other economic areas in the world show considerably higher rates of increase in research spending, which means that we are going to fall still further behind in comparison with those areas."
"The consequences of that will hit us hard and have long-term effects on prosperity, the labour market and social peace."
"We must concentrate the limited resources in a few key areas."
"We have set strategic targets to which everything else must be secondary, and we must regularly monitor whether we are achieving those targets."
"We must ensure that the research results do not end up gathering dust in cupboards or laboratories, but rather that our businesses can use those results to generate added value and therefore new jobs in Europe."
"I have the impression that we really have not been good enough in this area in the past few years."
"In conclusion, I call on the Member States to invest money from the Structural Funds in building research and development capabilities in their countries. That will enable the Seventh Research Framework Programme to concentrate properly on excellence in research."
"At the same time, the Member States can invest additional money in building research and development capabilities."
"If we want to maintain prosperity, jobs and social peace in Europe in the future, the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the CIP are the first step, but we still have a long journey ahead of us, and we absolutely must do better."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Buzek and the co-rapporteur for their persistent work."
"I welcome the fact that the Programme prioritises sectors such as frontier research, the production of carbon dioxide-free energy, nanotechnologies and social sciences."
"The latter will have particular significance in monitoring social changes arising from the digital lifestyle, which has itself been caused by the development of science."
"However, we must call attention to the fact that in spite of the increase in the total research budget, the annual research budget per capita in the European Union has not increased."
"This is another reason why it is important that an agreement has been reached about the creation of the European Research Area, which will be able to help bridge the gap in numerous fields."
"At this point it must be mentioned that for new Member States, who have considerable expertise, but meagre resources, it is very important that beyond the Framework Programme for Research, research infrastructures can also be funded from structural and cohesion funds."
"With reference to the debate, I would like to add that where stem cell research is concerned, I am in favour of progress."
"Mr President, the programme for research and technology is a real step forward."
"It is one of the most important building blocks that will allow us to compete at world level and it is an answer to globalisation."
"This European scale and the focus on excellence are what give this European endeavour intrinsic added value."
"Although we desperately need top research at European level, we also require a major and steady effort from the Member States and the regions."
"As shadow rapporteur for capacities – which falls within the research infrastructure – along with Mr Buzek, I have carefully examined a possible synergy with structural funds, which would enable high-quality structures and research infrastructure to be developed, and innovation and production to be supported."
"I am pleased that during the vote on structural funds 2007-2013 next month, this focal point will be given extra prominence."
"In a nutshell, we need to invest less in asphalt, concrete and roads, and more in research infrastructure and training our people."
"That is what Europe must set its sights on in the next couple of years."
"In that way, more specific research infrastructure can be created and developed."
"In actual fact, with limited resources, compared with big research projects that use up vast amounts of structural funds, we can double the budget."
"That is a different tune."
"It can be done."
"I have a question for Commissioner Potočnik."
"Will we during the halfway review be assessing both structural fund policy and its results, as well as this policy?"
"I have not many early indications as yet."
"I particularly have the 2013-2020 period in mind when I say this."
"Finally, I am pleased that a number of my amendments, including those with regard to medical examinations, healthy food, aviation and logistics, have been adopted."
"As for stem cell research, I take a reserved and conscientious line."
"I will be backing the amendment that was tabled jointly with Mrs Niebler."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Buzek and all shadow rapporteurs."
"Innovation is not one of the EU’s strong points."
"Despite the Lisbon agenda and the knowledge economy, it is not easy to demonstrate decisiveness, but there is one redeeming feature, namely the Seventh Framework Programme for research, which offers a great deal of scope for innovation, not least for SMEs."
"I have high expectations of the research programme in the area of energy, where it opens the door to efficiency and sustainability."
"Not only research, but demonstration projects are what matter."
"Geothermal energy, for example, is a possibility, as I have only just last week seen in Dutch horticulture, but it appears impossible to galvanise sponsors and users into action."
"The health programme is also important."
"Health is too important to leave to researchers from the private sector alone."
"In that respect, I believe that the ethical boundaries are defined very well."
"If we consider European industry as a whole, our focus may be weighted too much in favour of competition."
"Cooperation is at least equally important."
"We must move towards a fresh approach, open innovation, sharing knowledge and using knowledge together."
"I hope that the Seventh Framework Programme can contribute to this."
"Mr President, the new Member States had not been involved when the regulation of the principles contained in the Sixth Framework Programme was prepared."
"However, we did have the opportunity to participate in the Programme itself, which allowed us to gain considerable experience."
"We have tried to include the experiences of new Member States in the interesting and important debate for the preparation of the FP7 by the Commission."
"In this respect, I would like to emphasise two topics in our plenary session today."
"The first topic is deciding what the basis for the provision of assistance should be."
"I believe that it should be excellence, for it is excellence that makes Europe really competitive."
"I believe that we need three conditions here."
"The first condition is to provide access and network building, because this is the key to sustainable research quality."
"The second condition is to involve structural funds to a larger extent into building the research and development infrastructure."
"Parliament has actually voted in favour of my proposal in this respect, during the regulation of the funds."
"The third condition is to develop extensive consortia, in order to actually create the European Research Area, and to ensure that our researchers are not working in the United States or elsewhere."
"I would mention, for instance, the Galileo project, where a new European infrastructure could only be developed by using an extensive base."
"The second topic, briefly, is the necessity of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I can only welcome the proposal to channel at least 15% of the cooperation programme funds to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I have personally added a further proposal to this, which has been accepted by our committee, and which ensures easier access for small and medium-sized enterprises to European Union funds, especially for pre-financing."
"I ask Parliament, too, to support my proposal, because it is based on the experiences of the Sixth Framework Programme."
"We still have a lot of work to do, such as the VAT refund and other issues related to the regulation of utilisation, but I trust that the Seventh Framework Programme will bring us closer to the implementation of the single European Research Area."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by thanking Mr Buzek."
"He has the European patience – at which younger people can only wonder – to bring this work together."
"I should like to return to the aspect brought up by Mr van Nistelrooij."
"I think we have a big problem: in the Research Framework Programme, we have defined the European research area, and that presupposes the need for the accession countries to catch up."
"However, we are all in agreement that, in the global context, a programme like the Research Framework Programme must focus on excellence, because it will represent the competitiveness that we need in order to keep up and to be able to afford to build up Europe."
"The inclusion of the Structural Funds is therefore particularly important, and we will need to discuss it."
"A second subject that has been brought up is SMEs."
"In connection with this discussion, it is worth emphasising once again that 70% of all patents and utility patents in Europe are registered by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must support that, and we must find a way of giving these businesses more support."
"In this connection, we repeatedly come up against the problem of defining the term ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’."
"In the dimension currently taken by the European economy, the definition of small and medium-size enterprises as set out by the European Union is simply wrong: it includes too few businesses."
"Effectively, we are no longer supporting medium-sized industrial businesses – we are excluding them too much from the programmes."
"A third aspect that I see as important is the new security research programme."
"In this programme, we have implemented something that is really atypical for research."
"I think we can all agree that it is one of the central projects for the future in Europe, not just against the background of terrorism, but also because it offers development opportunities in many areas."
"We should therefore examine in the trialogue the Competitiveness Council's decision to make massive, if not the most massive, cuts in this area, of all places."
"These cuts are extremely problematic."
"– Mr President, for the common fisheries policy, the Seventh Framework Programme is not just disappointing, but it should be openly described as hypocritical."
"We must not forget that one of the Union’s great objectives is to lead a policy of economic efficiency and competitiveness within a framework of sustainable development."
"When we talk about sustainable development, it immediately brings to mind the marine environment and hence the consequences of fishing activity."
"Any fisheries management regulation must end with the usual proviso that decisions will be taken in accordance with the best available scientific advice."
"When Commissioner Borg presented the Green Paper on the European Union’s future maritime policy last week, he once again emphasised the essential need to know how the oceans work and he insisted that new fisheries management measures cannot be implemented without knowing how ecosystems work and how different economic activities affect them."
"Nevertheless, we have moved on from specific chapters for fisheries research, provided with EUR 150 million in the Fifth Framework Programme, to EUR 60 million in the Sixth Programme, where for the first time the focus on the issue of fisheries disappears."
"Those engaged in fishing activity need to know the size of populations of species and the way in which they are developing, to investigate new, more selective fishing techniques and to look into cultivating new species in order to respond to the rapidly increasing internal consumption of fish and tackle the dependency on imports."
"Without this kind of specific research, any regulation applied to fishermen will lack solid scientific bases and will have no credibility."
"We will not become a leader in the field of sustainable development policies by taking this kind of step backwards."
"We would therefore call upon everybody – the rapporteur in particular – to support the amendments that several political groups and several Members have presented and that provide for this focus on fisheries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this cover page from bears yesterday’s date of 12 June 2006."
"Unfortunately, it states that European education systems, including higher education, are failing."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for Research is based on three elements which are closely interdependent – education, research and innovation."
"If, however, the starting point of the three, in other words education, has already become an Achilles’ Heel, we can plan and support research and innovation as much as we like but the desired results will not materialise."
"Let us therefore support those institutions which rank among the most important from the perspective of education and its links to research, in other words universities."
"They constitute a natural source of enormous human potential that has so far not been effectively exploited."
"Let us promote a revival in research at universities and let us nurture the younger generation of scientists being educated there."
"Let us give them the sort of opportunities and motivation that will make them want to stay in Europe."
"Let us also give the opportunity to universities to fulfil the criteria of scientific excellence and let us support them in this effort, especially in the new Member States of the European Union."
"This could be – and I firmly believe that it will be – among the best of the investments within the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"I would like to end by thanking Mr Buzek and congratulating him on his report on this research."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for their contributions to the debate."
"The entire European Parliament has worked on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy received opinions from eight different committees."
"I briefly wanted to comment on the most important responses."
"The Framework Programme does have a shortcoming: insufficient funds."
"It is the only part of the Union budget which is growing."
"The growth rate has been approximately 30% per year on average in comparison with the Sixth Framework Programme."
"However, we had expected the growth rate to be twice that amount."
"That is why we are not satisfied and why we feel that an opportunity has been missed."
"Now, the important thing is to use what we have as best we can."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is meant to be the fly wheel of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have to unlock the potential of the 25 EU Member States."
"We have to achieve synergy between national programmes and regional activities."
"The most important slogan is ‘excellence in each project’."
"The second slogan is ‘science closer to industry, with an emphasis on innovation’."
"The third issue is fundamental research and the independence of the scientists conducting this research."
"Finally, the fourth issue is ‘people’ – ensuring the development of talent and making sure that the most talented have good conditions for implementing ideas."
"Otherwise, we will never succeed with the development and employment strategy for the EU."
"Two thematic priorities are health, about which there can be no doubt, and energy for Europe, or in other words clean, safe and secure supplies."
"We have too little crude oil and gas."
"We definitely need to turn our attention to renewable energy, clean coal technologies and nuclear energy."
"We cannot reject any of these."
"Finally, the most important thing is to implement the Seventh Framework Programme on schedule."
"The European Parliament voted on the financial perspective barely a month ago and is voting on the Framework Programme in two days’ time."
"This is a fantastic rate, so let us keep it up."
"I appeal to the Council to adopt a common position as soon as possible."
"Thank you to Commissioner Potočnik for his excellent collaboration."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament and all those present here are prepared to continue this cooperation, and we must do so on time."
"Mr President, I should like even so – hard on the heels of what Mr Buzek has just said about the trialogue we are going to have – to condemn the Council’s absence from this debate."
"The budget we are debating is the third European Union budget."
"Research is a vital tool of the Lisbon Strategy, and, by putting forward the objective of 1 January, Parliament is committing itself to ensuring that the scientific and industrial community is respected."
"The absence of the Council is a discouraging sign just when we are initiating a trialogue, which will have to take place quickly."
"Mr Busquin, the criticism has been received and will be addressed."
"Mr President, I should like to answer succinctly as many as possible of the concerns and issues raised."
"Firstly, on behalf of the Commission and personally, I should like to thank all the Members for their cooperation and support, for which I am very grateful."
"The number of speeches made this morning clearly proves that much attention has been devoted to the issues concerned and sends a clear signal as to the importance of European research to the future of Europe and to our lives and economies."
"I shall start with the budget and budgetary structure."
"The difference between the budgets that Parliament and the Council are proposing is now 2%, which is a very minor difference."
"I believe that we have a common understanding and that agreement on this point should be relatively easy."
"I would like to point out that one must be careful when comparing the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes, as these are structured differently and are sometimes difficult to compare."
"For example, in current prices, there is a 60% increase for actions under FP7, against one of 30% for the old continuity actions."
"Therefore, an increase of over 30% for certain continuity actions means that we are actually making these clear priorities."
"Twenty-five per cent of the actions are new, and approximately 75% of the actions are continuity actions."
"As regards thematic priorities, we must understand that these will also be addressed by the European Research Council, either now or in the future, but of course we do not know in advance what the structure of those thematic areas will be."
"Turning to small and medium-sized enterprises, I honestly have nothing against 15%, but believe that this must come about through political change."
"That is why I advocate simplification and why I believe that the 15% or 25% additional funding we are offering to small and medium-sized enterprises should result in changes."
"That is why we must pay attention to their needs, particularly in the work programmes."
"Concerning energy, it is clear – as a number of you quite rightly pointed out – that this is one of the major challenges we must address in the future."
"We all agree on this."
"However, the Commission’s opinion is that the challenge is simply too serious for us to leave any potential area out of the research – from renewables to hydrogen fuel cells, clean coal, nuclear energy, smart networks and more efficient use of energy, etc."
"This a truly important issue, and on the subject of environmental challenges such as climate change, I would say that these are more serious than we are sometimes ready to admit."
"Practically all our efforts in the field of research should move in a direction that makes our lives easier in the future."
"If we continue in the current direction we will be faced with some very serious challenges."
"I would like to make a few remarks regarding embryonic stem cell research and the European Research Council, which I talked about in my introduction."
"As regards embryonic stem cell research, if you ask any top scientist about this – as I have done recently – they will tell you that the right approach to addressing major health issues is through a combination of efforts from different sources and origins."
"That is their clear answer."
"I was asked a question on the Eurobarometer on biotechnology."
"As you know, the Commission regularly conducts Eurobarometer public opinion surveys on issues relating to biotechnology."
"The 2006 version is currently being finalised and should be available in the next ten days."
"However, since the question put was a clear one, I can tell you that, as regards the views on embryonic stem cell research across Europe, 55% of the population surveyed approved of this provided there was the usual government regulation or tighter regulation."
"Seventeen percent did not approve, except under very special circumstances."
"Only 9% did not approve under any circumstances, and 15% did not know."
"So, if one were to draw a line, 50% would approve this with tighter regulation, 25% would oppose it, some would allow it under very special circumstances, and 15% do not know."
"By the way, this is in line with the study published last year on social values as regards science and technology."
"This study found that over 90% of European citizens believe that medicines and new medical technologies will have a positive effect on our way of life over the next 20 years."
"I should say that we are aware of the differences that exist between different countries as regards what we are discussing today."
"This is not really a discussion about moral issues, but on whether we can establish a system at European level that strikes a balance between the very different national practices, bearing in mind ethical considerations."
"I truly believe that the Commission’s proposal is going in the right direction."
"The European Research Council represents a major change of mindset in Europe."
"That is why we should all be proud of what we are delivering."
"I want to try to convey to you how seriously I am taking this."
"Last weekend Professor Kafatos and I were in the United States and met the presidents of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health."
"I wanted him to be clearly visible on stage and for him to be seen as someone with whom they should correspond and cooperate in the future."
"I fully agree that the Cohesion Fund and the Framework Programme on Competitiveness and Innovation should be used hand in hand."
"Therefore, I fully agree with the inclusion of the concerns of the less-developed regions."
"We have to improve capacities there."
"We have to do everything in terms of infrastructure so that they can compete as regards excellence, and we need this excellence because we are in a global race."
"It is crucial that we understand that."
"Fisheries will be a cross-cutting issue on which special attention should be focused, and the Commission has clearly underlined that."
"Women are genuinely under-represented and we are trying to do our best to change that."
"Technology platforms have vast potential."
"They have developed from research actions but have already outgrown that purpose and have a role to play as regards lead markets and the European Institute of Technology, etc. They will be a crucial factor."
"As regards simplification, this was one of the most difficult tasks I have ever undertaken, but we are pushing ahead as hard as possible on this."
"In reply to the question from Mr van Nistelrooij about the mid-term review of the structural funds, I cannot commit myself because this is not in my area."
"However, it is a proposal in which I have an interest and I see it as a logical proposal which is going in the right direction."
"As regards the point on education, we are trying to pay special attention to universities because we believe that they could do more than they are doing now and that sometimes we are not too benevolent towards them."
"In conclusion, time truly matters, as some of you have underlined."
"It is crucial that we deliver the programme on time, so that the implementation rates in 2007 are as high as in the past."
"That is very important because it is a political affirmation of research and development that would strengthen our hand in future debates, which also link into budgetary issues."
"We want to go beyond the framework programme and into the European research area."
"There has been a switch of direction in Europe since the Second World War to a knowledge-based economy."
"Also, the rules for participation should be addressed very carefully because they are part of this timing issue and we should consider them carefully."
"The Commission is willing to be flexible and constructive in this trialogue, and wants to make a success of our common endeavours."
"Finally, I agree with those of you who feel that the budget should be higher, but at this moment the best thing is to focus on the delivery."
"If we focus on delivery we can prove that we need more financing in the future and that we can change European reality."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"– Those who side against the use of human embryos for research purposes declare that they stand for life and the dignity of the human being, because they defend the existence of an embryo that biologically wants to live, but which in the specific cases referred to would not actually have this chance because it is doomed to destruction."
"Those who side with research are also fighting for life, to offer the prospect of a dignified, normal life to tens of millions of women and men in Europe – real, live, breathing people – who suffer from diseases of the cardiovascular or nervous systems, diabetes or other diseases."
"It is important to give research a green light, for the sake of every person’s right to enjoy the best possible state of physical and mental health and to benefit from the extraordinary progress that science can offer."
"It is right, however, to limit indiscriminate research (reproductive cloning, chimeras, the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes, etc.) and to examine the morality of it, just as it is also right to respect the wishes of the people in those Member States where ethical issues prevail over progress."
"For all the rest, limiting our possibilities means depriving many people of the hope of a better future."
"Within the context of the revival of the growth and employment Lisbon objectives, the Seventh Framework Programme plays a role of the utmost importance."
"As a matter of fact, the Seventh Framework Programme aims clearly at contributing to the targets of the Lisbon Strategy as a whole, which in itself bears broad challenges."
"The development of a genuinely knowledge-based society is indeed a cornerstone for achieving the growth and employment objectives."
"It is now therefore one of the top priorities for the Union as a whole through the development of research and innovation, the development of the Union’s attractiveness and the promotion of new technologies."
"To achieve such objectives the current levels of funding of the Sixth Framework Programme must at least be preserved."
"Any budgetary cuts are therefore to be avoided."
"If the Union wants to boost research and innovation within the framework of the growth and employment objectives, optimal use of available resources is required."
"Efficient use of resources should of course go along with the simplification of the funding schemes to encourage the participation of SMEs in the Framework Programme."
"In this respect, I strongly welcome Mr Buzek’s report."
"Medical progress, and scientific progress in general, give rise to many debates and controversies."
"The crisis when it comes to determining ethical bases for medical research is, indeed, partly linked to the apparently uncontrolled, and worrying, expansion in what human beings are capable of doing."
"The links between science and ethics directly affect human life, and we are therefore led to make some major political choices."
"Our long-term responsibility is huge."
"Cloning for research purposes deserves to be encouraged through appropriate funding of research within the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"Researchers must be able to use stem cells in the context of fundamental and applied research."
"Research for therapeutic purposes is, indeed, vital if chronic or degenerative diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and neglected diseases are to be conquered."
"The European research programme must, therefore, fund only rigorously controlled research for therapeutic purposes."
"It must in no circumstances permit either reproductive cloning or research aimed at modifying the human genetic inheritance."
"Where the use of human embryonic stem cells is concerned, institutions, organisations and researchers need to be licensed and to be subject to controls in accordance with the rules of the Member State concerned."
"To begin with, I would like to congratulate Mr Buzek for his excellent work, which will be instrumental in attaining the Lisbon Strategy goals."
"I agree with the rapporteur that research and development are multipliers of growth; therefore, it is necessary to ensure greater involvement of the business sector in the research effort."
"I welcome the Commission’s proposal to more than double the EU research budget in the coming budget period and to improve the regulatory and administrative environment, particularly by emphasising the transparency of the evaluation process and by minimising project preparation costs."
"We need new technologies for the environmental, transport and energy sectors."
"Research must also be advanced in the healthcare sector, targeting in particular cardiovascular and infectious diseases, transplantation and novel drugs."
"However, I disagree with the original proposal for financing those types of research that are prohibited in some Member States and that contravene the principles of protecting human life and dignity from conception to natural death."
"I have in mind the invasive research of live human embryos and the harvesting for research purposes of oocytes from women."
"I firmly believe that the Seventh Framework Programme can secure better conditions for researchers and university students, and broaden their cooperation with top expert teams."
"This will speed up research into many scientific problems that impact the quality of life enjoyed by EU citizens."
"– The next item is the vote."
"."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 131(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Cross-border environmental problems can only be combated effectively through international cooperation."
"Protecting the Alps is one of the most important tasks for all Member States, because the economic, social and ecological problems of the Alpine region can be felt beyond its borders throughout Europe."
"The Convention on the Protection of the Alps was signed by the European Community on 7 November 1991 in Salzburg, and entered into force in 1998 following the Council Decision of 26 February 1996."
"Recently, the European Community signed the protocols on soil protection, energy and tourism, and they now need to be ratified."
"Unfortunately, the central protocol on transport has not yet been signed, and I would call on Italy in particular to do so."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just as when the Financial Regulation was last reformed in 2002, Parliament has again, in the March part-session, only voted on the amendments and not on the legislative resolution."
"However, only this formal resolution will mean that the European Parliament has issued an official opinion within the meaning of the EC Treaty."
"Under Parliament's Rules of Procedure, ladies and gentlemen, this matter must be put before us again and again until we, as Parliament, reach a definitive decision on it."
"We are still waiting for another document from the Commission relating to important implementing provisions, which should be ready by the beginning of July."
"Until we have had an opportunity to examine this document, we cannot seriously vote on the Financial Regulation."
"As rapporteur, I therefore once again move, on behalf of the competent committee, that it be sent back to the Committee on Budgets pursuant to Rule 168(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"At one of the next plenary sittings, we will present the legislative resolution to the House, so that negotiations can be opened with the Council."
"Mr President, most colleagues have this on their voting lists already."
"There is one slight change: ‘whereas on 10 June 2006 the suicides of three detainees at Guantánamo Bay have raised further international concern the detention facilities’ – rather than ‘ the detention facilities’."
"Mr President, I should like to make a very brief point of order concerning the vote we just had on the Guantánamo report."
"It is based on the same rule that Mr Brok used when he wanted to postpone the vote on this report."
"Perhaps during the next part-session, when people have requests like this, the trips that we make should be coordinated with the agenda of Parliament, rather than Parliament’s agenda being coordinated with the individual trips of Members of Parliament."
"Mr President, by agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Hughes, who cannot be in the House today, I would like to request referral back to the committee for further discussion."
"The reason for this is what happened last time, when this issue was shifted to last on the agenda."
"This meant that the majorities that there would normally have been were not achieved, and a number of proposals therefore fell."
"I therefore request that the matter be referred back to the committee so that we can achieve solid support for the whole proposal."
"Thank you."
"."
"Mr President, following discussions with other groups, it is a compromise amendment."
"I will read it in its entirety as it is short: ... ‘reinforces the view that, in principle, the petitions process should be a right which is targeted at European citizens who do not have other means of recourse to action by the European Parliament;"
"– That concludes the vote."
". We voted in favour of this report, which supports the adoption of the conclusion of the protocol on mountain farming."
"The protocol was initialled by the EC at the Ministerial Conference of the Alpine Convention at Chambéry on 20 December 1994."
"Under the overarching goal of sustainable development, the aim of the Protocol on Mountain Farming, provided for in Article 1, is to ensure and promote appropriate and environmentally friendly agriculture in the Alpine region as an essential contribution to the maintenance of populated sites and sustainable economic activities. This includes producing high-quality traditional produce, safeguarding the natural environment, protecting against natural risks and conserving the beauty and the value of the landscape."
"Contracting parties are required to optimise the multifunctional role of mountain farming."
"It is essential that support be provided for less-favoured areas, as in the case of the Alpine region, which is characterised by its wealth of natural resources, including water resources, agricultural potential, historical and cultural heritage, value for quality of life and for economic and leisure activities not only for the local but also for other populations."
"However, the Alpine region is also characterised by difficult living and production conditions for farming activities due to geomorphological and climatic conditions."
"The Alpine region has a sensitive ecosystem that is being put under considerable pressure by the ever increasing levels of traffic."
"It will take years of major financial investments to repair the resulting environmental damage."
"The people in the region too, however, also suffer particularly from health problems due to the increasing heavy goods traffic."
"If the Convention on the Protection of the Alps and the associated Transport Protocol, which are being held up mainly by the Italian freight lobby, actually do founder due to the lack of capacity in the Italian rail infrastructure, then it would be appropriate to work, for example within the Marco Polo framework, to expand that infrastructure."
"The Transport Protocol must finally enter into force in all eight Alpine states if we are going to prevent the progressive destruction of this valuable natural area and improve the quality of life for its inhabitants."
"Mr President, Labour MEPs support the regulation on groundwater, but we felt that some of the amendments in committee were overly prescriptive and also moved the groundwater directive away from provisions of the water framework directive."
"I hope that in conciliation we can find some commonsense solution to this, so that we allow the action to be focused on areas where the biggest problems are, rather than spending time, money and energy on managing groundwater where that is not in fact going to be a problem for public health."
". I would have liked the reference to the Nitrate Directive to have remained in the Groundwater Directive."
"This reference was extremely important for the agricultural sector, and its deletion by the majority of Parliament will lead to unnecessarily high costs for agriculture and to legal uncertainty, because the two directives now trigger separate measures independently of each other in the case of serious effects caused by nitrates."
". I believe that groundwater should be seen and treated as an independent ecosystem and therefore we should gear up to maintain groundwater in the most natural state possible so as to guarantee the good quality of the supply of water throughout Europe, and furthermore to minimise treatment of water which is supplied direct from source."
"We must assure that implementation is uniform throughout, especially as regards the Water Framework Directive."
"We must address the question of pollution in our groundwater and the concepts employed should be well defined."
"The groundwater protection and the nitrates directives should be well implemented to protect in the best way possible the products produced by the farming industry."
"Nevertheless we must ensure that duplication in provisions is avoided and thus the definitions have to be clear and well clarified."
"We must look forward to a common position that will ensure that threshold values are followed and adhered to."
"This will ensure better quality water for consumption and furthermore better agricultural products, which will as an end result ensure a healthier lifestyle for all the citizens of Europe."
"I support this recommendation and particularly reject attempts to lower EU water standards by effectively abandoning the 1991 Nitrates Directive, which Ireland has been ruled in breach of by the European Court of Justice."
"A 2004 European Environment Agency report estimated that removing nitrates from drinking water is up to ten times more expensive than taking preventive measures at farm level."
"Conservative amendments seeking to repeal the Nitrates Directive would therefore mean Irish taxpayers having to pay possibly billions more for clean drinking water."
"We have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water."
"We must err on the side of precaution, not on the side of cost."
"No Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards."
"They have failed to do so up to now."
"They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe, including in Ireland – which has still to implement the Nitrates Directive."
"We must set stringent standards and strict and severe penalties for those Member States which fail to meet those standards and we should not hide behind the principle of subsidiarity, which is simply escaping from our responsibilities."
". The directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution is now at the second reading stage."
"The purpose is to safeguard a natural resource that is vital to life because its reserves are the primary source of drinking water supply."
"At this stage, the main challenges are twofold: firstly, to ensure that the extension of the scope of the directive complies with the subsidiarity principle; and secondly, the effects of certain measures on farming practices and the need to introduce some amendments should, as the rapporteur says, lead to Community aid under the CAP being granted."
"The rapporteur also emphasises that an agreement must be reached on techniques for measuring groundwater pollution and that this should be done on the basis of comparable threshold values."
"In its common position, the Council leaves it entirely to the Member States’ discretion to lay down groundwater quality standards."
"Hence the emphasis on proposals that would facilitate some comparison and studies into the impact and effectiveness of this legislation, whereby a fresh assessment can be made some time after its implementation."
". I would have liked the reference to the Nitrate Directive to have remained in the Groundwater Directive."
"This reference was extremely important for the agricultural sector, and its deletion by the majority of Parliament will lead to unnecessarily high costs for agriculture and to legal uncertainty, because the two directives now trigger separate measures independently of each other in the case of serious effects caused by nitrates."
". Yes, we must protect our water in the face of the threats of pollution, at the same time as finding the optimum balance between safeguarding our groundwater and developing economic activities."
"The Framework Water Directive, which we have been waiting to see applied in a number of Member States for a very long time, establishes precise objectives and emphasises the polluter pays principle."
"It is, therefore, a matter of ensuring, above all, that these objectives are attained rather than of imposing new objectives that would be unattainable at present."
"Because groundwater differs from one area to the next, it would at present be counterproductive to impose compulsory quality standards to be applied uniformly throughout Europe."
"What is important is to require general monitoring, while leaving it to the Member States to determine threshold values for pollutants under the control of the European Union."
"Finally, I support Parliament’s request to the European Commission that specific measures be proposed within the framework of protecting spa water."
". At first reading, the Commission’s proposal for a directive on the protection of groundwater followed up Article 17 of the Water Framework Directive (200/60/EC), which provided for the adoption by the Council and Parliament of measures promoting protection and better quality of groundwater."
"The Council common position after first reading contained a number of technical shortcomings, and a lack of clarity and ambition. This will be remedied by the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, who has also endeavoured to ensure that this complies as far as possible with the framework directive."
"Among the important amendments introduced are as follows: the reintroduction of the ‘emissions-related approach’ taken in Directive 80/68/EC on groundwater in order to meet the objective of Article 4 of the Framework Directive, ‘to protect groundwater against pollution and deterioration’, tighter restrictions applied to the substances on the list in Annex VIII to the Framework Directive, with a view to preventing long-term contamination, and the need for recovery measures."
"Furthermore, Amendment 36, which removes the exemption of farming soils as regards the thresholds for compliance with the values established for nitrates, is of particular importance, as it ensures consistency with the objectives of protection and quality."
"This report seeks to set clear scientifically-based guidelines for assessing good quality groundwater and prevent further pollution."
"A natural resource occurring in rock aquifers, groundwater is used by agriculture and industry as well as for drinking water, yet it is particularly vulnerable to the problems of drought and pollution."
"I therefore welcome this report in so far as it endorses risk-based approaches to the problem of deterioration."
"This means leaving Member States a certain amount of flexibility to prioritise worst cases of degradation in order to make their resources are well-matched to problems arising."
"Given the varying ecological circumstances across the EU, it also means supporting local solutions with guidance on common approaches"
"Following the vote I and my EPLP colleagues remain unhappy about a number of technical issues relating to the directive, and understand the UK Government will now pursue these issues in the final negotiations between the European Parliament and the European Council."
"We still take it for granted that drinking water, as the primary necessity for life, is available at any time and in unlimited quantities."
"However, if we do not increase the awareness of our citizens and industry of the need to be careful with water, the reality already facing other countries, namely the battle for this priceless resource, could threaten our future generations."
"If we build in the wrong places, groundwater may suddenly disappear, never to return; and if we manage sensitive areas poorly out of greed, it could take decades for the groundwater to recover."
"Particularly with regard to groundwater protection, it is time for us to take a critical look at our support schemes."
"If, for example, we support trans-European transport or the cultivation of insecticide-intensive crops such as maize or tobacco, we are also increasing the risk of groundwater pollution."
"The EU must give a good example in such matters and, for example, provide greater support and encouragement for organic farming."
". It may be useful to have available to us a European system of access to geographical information, but this must take account of national characteristics, particularly where intellectual property is concerned."
"Out of context, we cannot oppose the promotion of free downloading. To facilitate this practice would, however, mean no longer having all the resources at present used for, on the one hand, renewing the stock of data and, on the other hand, purchasing new hardware made possible by technological developments."
"Finally, I regret that the problems associated with security and defence and with the protection of private life have not been raised at this stage."
"What tool or tools would enable us to react appropriately to a criminal or terrorist ordering photographs of, or seeking precise information about, a locality or place of residence or the address of a public or private building?"
". I shall be voting against amendments 13, 14, 18, 19, 23 and 24 to ensure the sustainable financing of high-quality spatial data in the United Kingdom."
"The amendments are incompatible with longstanding United Kingdom policy on information trading."
"By undermining the sustainable financing of high-quality spatial data they undermine the very purpose of the INSPIRE infrastructure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past eight years the population of the Slovak Republic has regularly been threatened by flooding."
"Slovakia is generally endangered by floods affecting large river basins; however, as we experienced last week in Eastern Slovakia, flash floods due to heavy rain at a particular location are typical in many regions."
"Natural phenomena and, ultimately, climatic changes are the main causes of flooding."
"The extent of the losses due to flash floods to a large extent depends on human activity, such as upstream logging, inadequate drainage methods and, especially, extensive construction in high-risk, flood-prone areas."
"I greatly appreciate the efforts of the authors of the draft directive, that is, the Commission, to draw up and make more complete flood maps and indicative maps of flood-induced losses."
"Coordinated planning and activity in the basins and cross-border basins of EU Member States will ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are reasonably reflected and that the available resources are used efficiently."
"Community-level cooperation generates substantial added value and improves the overall level of flood protection."
"That is why I have voted for this report."
"Mr President, Labour MEPs abstained on the final vote on the floods directive."
"It is a pity that the directive does not focus on the rivers in Europe where the main problem lies: cross-border rivers."
"I am afraid that the Commission will now be flooded with maps of domestic rivers all over Europe."
"The main area in which the EU can make a difference is trans-border rivers, where joint management by Member States is extremely important."
"We wanted to have an exemption for all domestic river basins."
"That would have made more sense."
"I hope, therefore, that when the Commission comes back to look at the details it will have a very light-touch regime for those countries that do not have trans-border rivers."
"We believe that, in the light of the principle of subsidiarity, an EU policy on floods is only justified in cases involving cross-border watercourses."
"We therefore supported Amendment 81, which unfortunately fell in plenary."
". Flood risk assessment and management is, in my view, a positive step."
"Although floods are a natural phenomenon, human activity can either exacerbate the risks or mitigate the effects."
"The massive reduction in the natural flood retention capacity of river basins, the mismanagement of human activities (such as increasing human settlements and economic assets in floodplains and the erosion and reduction of the natural water retention of land by cutting down forests and farming in river basins), droughts and global warming are contributing to an increase in the likelihood and adverse effects of floods."
"At present there is no legal instrument at European level for flood risk protection."
"Accordingly, in compliance with the solidarity principle and without prejudice to the subsidiarity principle, risk management and flood damage containment measures should not be limited to the aid provided for in the EU Solidarity Fund."
"This is especially important in flood risk management of catchment basins that flow through two or more countries, and as such other relevant Member State and Community policies need to be coordinated and implemented, including, for example, water transport policy, agricultural policy and cohesion policy."
"Although we do not endorse all of the proposals, we welcome the thrust of this report."
"Mr President, it is good that the European Parliament should be concerned about the situation of the political prisoners in Guantánamo."
"It would be even better if it were to be concerned about the situation of prisoners of conscience in European countries and, in particular, about that of the great historian David Irving, who is being illegally held in Austria."
"That being said, the situation of the Guantánamo Islamists presents a genuine problem."
"Either they are prisoners of war, in which case they must be treated as such, or they are to be viewed in terms of common law as criminals and terrorists, in which case they must each have the right to a trial, with counsel for the defence, and to be judged under the rules of common law."
"In any case, we cannot approve of artificially maintaining what is to all intents and purposes an area in which the law does not apply in a country – Cuba – that is a relic of the colonial era and that, moreover, we rightly criticise for its human rights violations."
"The United States of America is setting an odious example in what could be a just cause: that of the fight against terrorism."
". I abstained on these votes, not because I do not deplore the situation in Guantanamo, which I do, but because, in keeping with my position on the European Union and its institutions, I do not acknowledge its legitimacy to comment on these matters."
". In supporting this resolution I wish to put on record my concern about the three suicides reported from Guantánamo this past weekend, and continuing use of extraordinary rendition by the CIA on behalf of the United States with the cooperation and collusion of many European governments."
"These governments, including the Irish Government, are violating their own charter as to Human Rights, which means we have sunk to an appalling level where one must question the viability of international law."
"Any government that believes in the fundamental principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or in such statements as that of the European Convention on Human Rights, must not just unequivocally condemn what is happening in Guantánamo, but must campaign for its immediate closure."
"No campaign against international terrorism is served by operating outside of international law in its most fundamental aspects."
"Indeed, the United States Supreme Court itself has spoken in the past on the importance of not using tyrannical methods in dealing with what was suggested as the threat of tyranny."
"The international community is tested by its willingness to achieve the closure of Guantánamo and related facilities immediately."
". I will be voting for this resolution."
"It is a balanced criticism of what the Bush Administration is doing in holding terrorist suspects illegally in prison in a part of Cuba some would argue it occupies illegally."
"The terrible events of 09/11 changed the world and we have enormous sympathy with the families of the victims and the survivors."
"It was and is only right and proper that we combine in the fight against terrorism around the world, whether in New York, or Madrid, London or Jakarta."
"Yet our combined struggle is undermined with the existence of Guantanamo Bay, the revelations regarding 'extraordinary rendition' that our Committee of Inquiry is investigating, and the failure to properly investigate allegations of atrocities in Iraq."
"Two wrongs do not make a right."
"Our struggle can only win the moral high ground if it clearly is within the limits of national and international law."
". Four years on, following a number of watered down positions on the USA’s appalling detention centre at Guantánamo, Parliament has adopted a resolution that ‘reiterates its call on the US Administration to shut down the detention facility’."
"Parliament also condemns torture, including the euphemistically termed ‘special interrogation techniques’, such as sexual humiliation, ‘water boarding’ and electric shocks, which constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment."
"All of those who have always condemned this unacceptable, brutal and inhuman situation have a duty to condemn these practices."
"Yet Parliament has failed to condemn the true nature of the so-called 'war on terror' and the way in which the United States has used it to occupy sovereign states and attack their populations."
"Parliament has also failed to condemn the fact that the Guantánamo detention centre is not an isolated case and that it actually forms part of an onslaught led by the USA in contravention of international law and the United Nations conventions and Charter. We have no truck whatsoever with this onslaught, which must be condemned."
". The issue of the prisoners of the ‘war on terror’ lies at the heart of the biggest challenge posed to us by terrorism, namely ensuring the security of our citizens without losing our values, a challenge that we must meet head on."
"In this fight, which we must support, the paradigms to which we have been accustomed have not proved sufficient."
"In this war, there are no properly uniformed and identifiable combatants, in line with the Geneva Convention. That being said, treating soldiers in a war as common criminals would be a legal mistake and an insensitive act in terms of security."
"I therefore feel that first and foremost a new legal framework needs to be found for the situation underpinning the Guantánamo detentions."
"Although I acknowledge the exceptional nature of the current state of affairs, however, it is right and proper that the fundamental principles of international law should be adopted and adapted."
"Yet we must adhere to international law without the hypocrisy of those who pass on the difficult work to third parties."
"Guantánamo is bad and we want it to be closed down."
"Nevertheless, although the international legal system does not have an adequate response to the new reality of the terrorist threat, I feel that the Member States have a duty to seek a fresh solution that is humane, just and secure."
"To sum up, the law needs to be reviewed."
".I am particularly worried about the situation of the Guantanamo prisoners, which is deteriorating with each passing hour."
"Since the camp opened, there have been numerous suicide attempts."
"Faced with a wall of indifference and the systematic denial of their rights, the prisoners prefer to put their lives in danger."
"All that these prisoners want is to have a fair trial."
"If they are indeed terrorists, then let them be sentenced."
"If they are not, then let them be released."
"For that to happen, justice must be done."
"How to respond to terrorism is a real challenge in terms of our values."
"If we cannot accept the fact that the fundamental rights of our fellow citizens are being jeopardised by terrorists, then we cannot accept the fact that fundamental rights are being denied at Guantanamo on the pretext that terrorists probably number among the prisoners being held."
"The only way in which we can fight against terrorism effectively is by means of justice."
"We must therefore demand a fair trial on United States soil for each person being held at Guantanamo."
"This is a question of the survival of a peaceful world."
". The British Conservative delegation has abstained on the motion on the situation of prisoners in Guantánamo because it suggests in paragraphs 2 and 3 that torture is commonplace in this facility, which our American allies totally reject."
"Furthermore paragraph 8 explicitly asserts that the detainees are protected by the Geneva Convention, which in the case of illegal combatants not wearing uniforms, concealing their weapons and not subject to a military hierarchy, is disputed internationally by legal experts."
"We do support the eventual closure of Guantánamo, which has become a serious international issue for the United States, but this can only occur when alternative facilities are found to detain some of the most dangerous individuals threatening Western free societies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me on my behalf, and on behalf of you all, to welcome the members of the Chilean delegation of Senators and MPs headed by Mr JorgeTarud Daccarett, who are present in the diplomatic gallery and who will be participating in the 4th Meeting of the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee which takes place today in Strasbourg."
"In the name of our institution I would like to extend a most cordial welcome to them."
"As you must be aware, the EU and Chile have concluded an Association Agreement which envisages relations based on three footings: trade, cooperation and political dialogue."
"It is thanks to this Agreement coming into force that we were able to set up the Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"I firmly believe that the commencement of the 4th Meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee will signal a new and important period of ever closer cooperation between the two sides, which recognise the same democratic values and share a common approach to the principles of the rule of law."
"The next item is the report (A6-0176/2006) by Mr Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the European Community (2006/2062 (INI))."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are to vote on concerns pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning in the European Community, an issue on the topical nature and importance of which the majority of us are in agreement."
"I think this was also the main reason why no amendments were tabled in plenary."
"Having said which, I should like first of all to thank all the rapporteurs of all the political groups for their important comments and valuable help and all my honourable friends for the amendments which they tabled during discussions of my report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Having said which, I have tried to bring this report to a conclusion in close cooperation with the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European office of the World Health Organisation and various other national health departments, including the health department in my country, Cyprus."
"At the same time, I have received in this endeavour suggestions from non-governmental organisations, from specialists in pandemics and even from the vaccine industry."
"I should like to make a point of thanking them all for their help."
"I shall try to be as brief and succinct as possible."
"There are five important points which I would like to expound: efforts to intensify coordination, the existence of 'flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs, information, transparency and public awareness, financing and financial aid for countries that need it."
"The fact cannot be overlooked that there is a strong need to tighten and intensify coordination between the Member States and the Commission and this is also the reason why coordination plays such an important role in the report."
"The Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are already doing an extremely important job by testing existing national pandemic prevention plans and carrying out exercises."
"Nonetheless, these exercises also need to take place in regional areas, while at the same time emphasising cross-border cooperation."
"As far as anti-viral drugs are concerned, plans to acquire them and the way in which they are used does not appear to be satisfactory enough."
"However, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, more action needs to be taken in order to strengthen such programming."
"Furthermore, research and development need to be promoted, so that the vaccines in question can be supplied as quickly as possible and, once that happens, so that their equal and fair distribution can be safeguarded."
"Information, transparency and public awareness are fundamental and will facilitate the work of the Member States and the Commission in warding off a possible pandemic."
"With regard to the African and Asia countries, which are also considered to be the countries with the greatest need, we must ensure that they are provided with technical, economic and financial help."
"At this point I should perhaps stress that the Commission has already managed to achieve a great deal in this direction and I trust that it will continue in the same vein."
"Satisfactory appropriations must also be made available so as to maximize public awareness, so that European citizens can obtain more information, so that research and development can be developed in the ultimate aim of creating anti-viral drugs, of giving the Commission the opportunity to create a Community stock of anti-virals and, of course, of giving third countries the economic and technical assistance they need."
"Of equal importance with these points is the protection of small and medium-sized poultry units, which have sustained a serious blow from avian influenza, and the proper application of the provisions of Community law relating to safety in the workplace, especially for high-risk groups consisting of workers in close and constant contact with birds."
"Finally, I should like to point out that I supported most of the amendments tabled by my honourable friends following discussion of my report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"In particular, I must stress that the amendment on the prevention of panic among the public, on combating any trafficking which could arise if there were genuinely serious risks and on ensuring the fair distribution of products for use in combating the epidemic, the amendment on the constant upgrading of the Member States' preparedness plans and the amendments relating to the acquisition of adequate protective equipment and the Commission's preparedness to adopt crisis measures such as quarantine and disinfection measures in aeroplanes are amendments which help to make the report an integral report."
"I should like once again to thank the committee secretariat for its valuable help with my report and all my associates."
"Thank you once again."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur for the very good and constructive work which he has done on this report and, of course, the members of the committee who worked with him."
"I address this report with satisfaction and joy, because I can see that the European Parliament and the European Commission are addressing such a serious issue in the same manner, with the same perception and the same approach."
"Of course, I must stress from the beginning that we are talking about the possibility of a pandemic, about a possible pandemic."
"It is not a certainty."
"It may happen as a result of the bird 'flu virus, it may happen as a result of some other virus, it may not happen at all."
"However, the fact that it is a possibility, despite the fact that our scientists indicate to us that it is a very slight possibility, does not give us any justification for not preparing ourselves satisfactorily, adequately, suitably and as much as possible."
"This is perhaps the first time in human history that we have forewarning, that we have certain messages that such a pandemic may occur."
"This preparation needs to be carried out not only at national level but also at Community level."
"As regards the report, I feel particularly satisfied, because most of what the report asks us to do we have either already achieved or we are in the process of covering and achieving."
"Of course, I always consider the contribution and cooperation of the European Parliament particularly important in our endeavour."
"I refer to the example of the Solidarity Fund, which will help in the event of a pandemic to cover pharmaceutical requirements in terms of vaccines and anti-virals."
"It is about just over a year since the first time we debated this issue in plenary and I must say that we have achieved a great deal since then."
"We now have national preparedness and response plans in all the Member States, we have the Community preparedness plan, the one we are debating today, we tested all the plans in a simulation exercise last November and now we are in the process of improving these plans on the basis of the weaknesses identified during that exercise."
"There is very close cooperation with the World Health Organisation."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, has taken on a leading role in this sector and will soon take charge of the early warning system."
"I agree with the need for communication and information as regards the citizens and we have already started working on this sector; we have organised meetings of the competent representatives of the Ministries of Health in the Member States and with all the competent organisations on how we shall handle messages to the public in the event of a crisis and now we are proceeding with seminars and workshops with media, so that we can inform them, so that we can update them and develop cooperation which will be applied in the event of a crisis."
"We are making progress on the question of creating a pandemic vaccine."
"The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is cooperating in this sector, we are cooperating with industry, we are investing in research and we are trying to speed up the procedures and, of course, to increase the production capacity of the pharmaceutical industry."
"As regards anti-virals, we have already achieved double the production capacity of anti-viral drugs compared with the previous year and now the challenge is for the Member States to make use of this capacity."
"It is within their competence to place the necessary orders."
"Today, especially in this sector, we are in a much better position than we were last year."
"By the end of the year, we shall be able to say that in total 16.5% of the European population will be covered."
"However, this is slightly misleading, because it is not the same level in each Member State."
"Some Member States have over 25% coverage and others have almost nothing."
"It is, therefore, extremely important that we set the necessary targets and cover these states with anti-viral drugs."
"As regards the stockpile strategy, I agree with the committee's view, but I would remind you that this subject was initially raised by two Member States, Belgium and France; it was not the Commission's proposal, it is a matter which comes within the competence of the Member States."
"The Commission has made no effort to extend or increase its competences and powers, but we did accept this suggestion, because we see the usefulness of there being a European stockpile strategy to the same standards as the World Health Organisation stockpile."
"It will cover the Member States until such time as they acquire their national stockpile and could also cover neighbouring countries and be used strategically as a fire-fighting measure with the first cases of a pandemic, in order to give the Member States the facility to address a prolonged pandemic."
"There is no legal basis for this at Community level."
"It would need to be with the unanimous agreement of the Member States, who would have to finance such an endeavour."
"Unfortunately, in the debate held last September it appeared that a very small number of Member States opposed in principle the creation of this strategic stockpile."
"The overwhelming majority supported the matter in principle, but a very large number of Member States were not prepared to cover these requirements from national funds."
"I believe that, in light of these positions by the Member States, there is no margin for continuing this debate or for continuing work on this issue."
"What is important now is for every Member State to accept its responsibilities and to set and cover its national targets."
"To continue an already prolonged debate without there being any prospect on the horizon of agreement merely sends out the wrong message and raises false hopes, especially for both the citizens and the Member States that need this stockpile today, which is why it is better for everyone to know where they stand and, consequently, each Member State will take its own responsibilities."
"As I said at the beginning, most of the measures which will be taken to prepare for a pandemic come mainly within the competence of the Member States. However, the European Commission will continue to coordinate and to have the initiative, to have a decisive role in this preparation with exercises, with laboratories and with working parties, even at ministerial level, but of course we consider Parliament's contribution to be particularly important in this endeavour."
"As far as we as the European Commission are concerned, we shall exhaust all our practical, technical and legal potential in order to achieve the highest possible level of preparedness in the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, influenza is a disease with grave health, social and economic implications; it also has ramifications in the defence sector and politics."
"H5N1 could mutate and give rise to a new flu virus subtype that would be transmissible from humans to humans and gradually spread, causing an epidemic or pandemic."
"The avian flu virus is seldom transmitted from birds to humans; however, the WHO has reported 185 cases of this infection and 104 deaths in the period from 2003 to March 2006."
"This number of human fatalities should be seen as a reminder that we cannot afford to ignore."
"Public debate in this area has highlighted new issues, and the Member States have set about establishing pandemic commissions and drawing up pandemic plans coordinated on the European level."
"The Member States are talking to one another now, because if a flu pandemic breaks out, no single country will be able to cope with it on its own."
"Interest has increased in antiviral drugs as the first line of defence and intervention."
"Vaccine manufacturing procedures have been upgraded, and there has been greater interest in speeding up the development, production and deployment of new vaccines."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is based on two communications from the European Commission on this issue."
"Emphasis has been placed on essential measures and crisis management within 24 hours, including quarantine and travel restrictions."
"There have been calls to improve coordination between the Commission, Member States and the relevant European agencies."
"I believe that the key is to stockpile antivirotic drugs and, to the extent possible, speed up the production and distribution of vaccines."
"The use of these vaccines should be financed from the Solidarity Fund."
"Awareness is an absolute prerequisite for responsible decision-making."
"It is essential that the Members of the European Parliament be regularly informed of scientific developments relevant to medicinal products and vaccines, and of the level of Member State preparedness."
"We should also not overlook the need for prompt communication with the public and media about the situation and the measures that need to be taken."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Adamou, the rapporteur, on an excellent report."
"It is well balanced and rational, and draws sensible conclusions on how to deal with an event which we all very much hope will not happen."
"We have managed to avoid the bird flu pandemic so far."
"However, it is absolutely right to be prepared and to be prepared to work together and to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to deal with a pandemic, should it occur."
"The fact that we have gone into this in a spirit of cooperation, that the Commission has talked about cooperation, and that we have encouraged discussion and debate in the Member States to ensure that all the basic things are in place – such as having enough vaccine should the worst happen – is a very good example of the European Union, this Parliament, the Commission and the Member States working together for the benefit of all the citizens of Europe."
"One of the most important things that we, as elected representatives, are here to do is to ensure the safety of our constituents, the people whom we represent."
"This report, and the thought that has gone into what we should do if the worst happens and we have a pandemic, is a really good example of that."
"I should like to finish by highlighting an example of what has been going on in my own region, in London."
"I should like to offer particular thanks to the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which has carried out work in this area and helped with the development of antivirals and vaccines against this and other infectious diseases."
"I think we should hold this up as an example of what we have done here and of what institutions are doing in the Member States, and of how we can handle pandemics such as this one, which we hope will not actually take place."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Adamou has compiled an excellent report."
"It demonstrates that we take the threat of a bird flu pandemic seriously and that there is no time to sit back and take a wait—and-see approach in case one does break out, for then it will be too late."
"I am also pleased that, along with the parliamentary committee, he has taken on board a few of my suggestions, such as urging the Council to empower the Commission to take crisis measures within 24 hours in the event of a pandemic breaking out."
"I should like to add three comments."
"In the first place, the Commissioner was right to say that we have been warned."
"We can therefore expect a possible pandemic at some point."
"We will then need a strategy for the European institutions, because in the case of a pandemic, travel restrictions may also affect major international meetings."
"It will therefore become more difficult to meet in Brussels or Strasbourg, never mind in both."
"We have not really given this enough consideration yet."
"I have written to President Borrell on this matter, and he has replied to assure me that the services will be looking into this, and this was followed by a deafening silence."
"The second point concerns the promotion of better cooperation between the Member States."
"I am glad that the Commissioner insisted on this so passionately, because according to a report that was recently published in the medical journal , even if Member States are properly prepared for an outbreak of a flu pandemic to start with, they are completely oblivious to the plans of the neighbouring countries and do not, therefore, benefit from mutual harmonisation and cooperation."
"If in the case of a crisis, Germany, for example, were to decide as part of its strategy to close its border with the Netherlands, then the Netherlands might want to know about this."
"This is just one example."
"It is really beyond me why the public health ministers recently decided against creating an emergency supply of antiviral drugs."
"We already know that we will face a shortage of those drugs in the event of an outbreak, and a European supply could then prove the answer."
"I congratulate the Commissioner on responding to this in a way that was sharp, tough and public."
"I am right behind him on that."
"Finally, such measures as, for example, the placing of disinfecting mats at airports are, of course, useful if they are taken the world over, but the biggest problem during a pandemic will be travel."
"One of the aspects that must be considered is that, for example, the media will want to travel to crisis areas and back and can, as such, also be a source of infection."
"It might not be a bad idea if we, looking at our own situation, were to give this some thought and explored ways in which this could be resolved, without, obviously, putting the freedom of the press at risk."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb according to which ‘forewarned is forearmed’."
"I think that today’s debate should be seen in that light."
"At the risk of sounding defeatist or spreading panic, it is a good thing that the EU and the Member States are preparing for the possibility of a bird flu pandemic among humans."
"Mr Adamou’s report does a good job of summarising what is at stake and the calm, yet bold, ways in which the authorities must tackle this problem."
"In my view, what is crucial in this respect is paragraph 23, which calls for structured and multidisciplinary cooperation between experts, experts in human and animal health, specialists in the areas of virology, epidemiology, pathology and agriculture."
"The input of communication experts cannot be underestimated either, though."
"These are people who can translate complex scientific findings in a simple but correct manner intended for the public at large."
"All this expertise should, in my view, and also according to Mr Adamou’s report, be pooled in a European influenza working party that should also team up with the manufacturers."
"We will need to invest in overcoming national chauvinism."
"There is no justification for certain Member States, often the most cash-rich ones, buying up, at this stage, the production capacity of antiviral drugs with certain manufacturers and refusing to display the slightest solidarity with those countries that are not capable of doing the same."
"That is why we certainly endorse paragraph 30, in which the Commission is expressly asked to guarantee that there are sufficient antiviral drugs and vaccines for those who are exposed to the virus."
"Commissioner Kyprianou, your introduction addresses this issue in detail."
"You said that there is no legal justification for this."
"You also said that in principle, a number of Member States are in agreement, but when the chips are down, refuse to make the funds available."
"I would like to ask you, when you respond, to make known in full transparency the names of the Member States that refuse to act in solidarity."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Adamou on his excellent report."
"Bird flu remains a huge threat to human and animal health in Europe and outside, and it is clear that coordination at European level is required."
"If somewhere, anywhere in the EU, a loophole appears in the measures against bird flu, the implications for all of us can be devastating."
"It would, however, be foolish not to look beyond our Union, because the virus will not be careful to stay within our outside borders."
"That is why it is vital that we work together with all countries in an extensive and intense effort."
"The EUR 80 million which the EU has currently made available for aid to third countries is, in my view, somewhat paltry."
"It is not an area on which we should economise."
"It might be an idea, for safety reasons, in order to stop the virus from spreading, to abandon Parliament’s monthly moves and to invest the EUR 200 million that we would save into combating the virus."
"For the rest, since prevention is better than cure, it is important to provide adequate responses in the event of an outbreak."
"It is important to ensure that the public is properly informed, but prevention is an area on which we will need to focus most."
"I happen to take the view that inoculating poultry in Europe is still the best method of prevention."
"Not only does this reduce the risk of the virus spreading, but it can also prevent the needless slaughter of millions of animals, and thus also psychological damage among the farmers and aid workers involved."
"."
"Mr President, the problem of avian flu has once again appeared on the European Parliament’s agenda."
"This is a good thing as we cannot afford to ignore any threats."
"We have to be prepared for crisis situations, we have to be prepared to prevent them and we have to be prepared for the outbreak of an epidemic."
"We also have to prevent the mass media from spreading panic, as well as preventing various illegal lobbying activities on the part of antiviral drug and vaccine manufacturers, especially as we currently know little about the effectiveness of these drugs and almost nothing about their side effects."
"That is why I think it is necessary to develop an international system to fight avian flu and to create, within the framework of this system, a network of scientific and research institutes and early detection laboratories."
"Secondly, we need to prepare national administrations and society for a crisis situation."
"Thirdly, we need to secure the legal and economic basis for providing aid to poultry producers in regions threatened by a pandemic."
"The European Commission should play a key role in all these actions on European Union territory."
"The Commission should also work closely together with European partners and with partners from other continents, especially those affected by avian flu."
"Here I am thinking of Asia and Africa in particular."
"To sum up, we must draw up a complete and specific crisis management plan at an international, regional, local and national level."
"Only such a plan will give us any chance of putting in place adequate protection and prevention measures."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are spending hundreds of millions on the Tamiflu antiviral, without heeding the warning of Hanoi University Hospital."
"That hospital has probably dealt with more human victims of avian flu than anywhere else in the world, and the staff there tell us that Tamiflu is useless, that it does nothing."
"As we learn about this flu, we move from a feeling of initial helplessness."
"We now know that the principal danger is not posed by migrating wild birds which we cannot control, but by domestic or, should I say, industrial fowl, and our handling of them and of their waste products."
"We can do something about that and I would refer you for a model to the example of Ireland’s actions in successfully containing the foot-and-mouth outbreak a few years ago."
"Farms had disinfectant baths and carpets at all entrances."
"Animal markets were closed and any movement of farm animals was closely monitored and largely stopped."
"We even cancelled our St Patrick’s Day parades, but the strategy of containment was successful and it can be successful again."
"We can hope to contain avian flu before it reaches a human-to-human transmission stage."
"Mr President, I want to begin by warmly welcoming Mr Adamou's report, which we wholeheartedly support."
"I welcome what the Commissioner has said about the steps being taken as, indeed, I welcome the report that has been referred to by Mr Koker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."
"I want to highlight three aspects."
"The first is vaccine research."
"What is clear is that if we rely on the egg-based vaccine, even once we know the strain of the flu, it will take six to eight months for that to come on stream."
"And if the flu pandemic has come as a result of bird flu or hen flu, we are likely to have slaughtered all the hens, which means there will be no eggs for vaccines."
"So, there is an urgent need to research alternatives and in particular the DNA vaccine and I look forward to hearing what is happening on that."
"Secondly, on preparedness: this excellent report covers a wide range of matters which need to be put into operation."
"There is one missing, I think, which concerns the devices to deliver the vaccines."
"I hope that will be included in the work being done in the Commission."
"Thirdly, on the stockpile: Mr Staes asked for the names of the countries which are blocking the stockpile."
"I will give them to him: it is the Netherlands, it is Sweden and it is Slovakia."
"In addition, we had Britain, Germany and Portugal giving conditional support, depending on who was going to pay for it."
"I think that is based on a misunderstanding of what the stockpile is supposed to be."
"It is not meant to replace the work of the Member States, it is not meant to save them from having to build their own stockpiles; it is an insurance policy against the possibility that we will have an urgent situation within or perhaps outside our borders – for instance, in Moldova or Belarus, in which case it would be in all our interests to smother that outbreak as quickly as possible, before it spreads to the European Union."
"For that reason, I beg the Commissioner to go back to the Council, explain what it is all about, knock heads together and make sure that those countries that have been blocking it to date remove that block so that we have this stockpile ready to protect ourselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Adamou on his report."
"Many Members have supported the idea of a strategic stockpile of antivirals, and I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety should have accepted my proposal to implement a compulsory licensing system that should enable us to produce these antivirals more quickly and in far greater numbers so that at least 25% to 30% of the population is covered in each Member State."
"The stockpile of antivirals is not enough, however."
"It is crucial that we increase the rate at which the vaccines are produced, because this will obviously be a deciding factor when it comes to limiting the pandemic."
"I regret that, from this perspective, the Union has not agreed to finance – or, at any rate, my fellow Members have not accepted its financing – a strategic public-private partnership on the subject of speeding up the production of vaccines against avian influenza."
"My second point relates to antibiotics, which are in danger of running out once the influenza takes hold, because a whole series of complications will occur for which large stocks of antibiotics may prove necessary, mortality being due not only to the influenza, but also to the associated complications."
"Thirdly, the danger of shortages: if we had to shift to producing extremely large amounts of antivirals in the European Union, the raw materials needed to make the antivirals and the masks could start to run out if the provision of supplies is not guaranteed and diversified."
"Finally, since avian influenza is merely the first warning sign that major pandemics and epidemics, and particularly viral diseases, are developing on the planet, at a faster rate because of trade, it is altogether crucial that the Union takes the lead when it comes to producing new generation vaccines."
"My fellow Member, Mr Bowis, just spoke about this."
"The fact is, the very nature of our vaccines makes it difficult to produce them if we do not have any new strategies available to us."
"Finally, the WHO needs increased powers of surveillance and control because, from now on, we must be united."
"The surveillance and control network must be efficient and must operate on a worldwide scale."
"Mr President, I am afraid I will bring heresy to this debate."
"As a medical scientist, I am convinced that the issue of an impending avian flu pandemic is a myth."
"Although the high-pathogenicity strain H5N1 was first reported about ten years ago, and although precautionary measures in the most affected areas of the world have been almost non-existent, we only had about 100 fatalities worldwide, i.e. ten deaths per year!"
"Even the number of people dying from a simple cold is much larger that that!"
"The argument that a mutational change would make the avian flu virus a much greater threat is seriously flawed."
"Mutations in human viruses occur all the time and we humans can do very little to stop them from occurring."
"But in any event, why do we not worry about the possibility of so many other theoretically possible mutational viral changes?"
"Indeed, why do we not panic about the mutation causing the flu virus acquiring a cancer-causing capability?"
"The scientific evidence is that the risk to humans of avian flu is almost zero."
"The paranoia of an avian flu pandemic has drawn vital resources from other health areas and has largely benefited the pharmaceutical industry and the media."
"As a sign of protest against this state of affairs and although I have the greatest respect for the rapporteur, I am reluctant to vote in favour of this report in substance; this is only a paper exercise."
"Early detection and the early warning and response system are vital components of the EU strategy to deal with any possible flu pandemic."
"I am glad to hear the Commissioner say that the European Centre for Disease Control will shortly address this issue."
"I congratulate Mr Adamou on this excellent report."
"I join my colleagues in stressing the importance of adequate financial and technical support to developing countries, particularly the least developed, and in urging the Commission to work for a more coherent international framework following the Beijing Pledging Conference."
"Mr President, avian flu, like other viral infections, can be very dangerous."
"The document on preparedness and response planning in the event of a flu pandemic is certainly necessary and will undoubtedly be helpful."
"I would, however, like to draw your attention today to another problem."
"This is a problem that is rarely mentioned when discussing broad prophylactic measures."
"We ought to consider plans to decentralise poultry farming and return to using natural feeding methods."
"Poultry living in such conditions and fed in a natural manner will be more resistant to disease, and the meat produced will be healthier for humans than that obtained from mass-produced poultry, or in other words crowded flocks of birds that are fed an unvarying and unnatural diet and sometimes kept in very stressful conditions."
"Furthermore, profit-driven production achieved in such a deceitful manner is harmful, and the profits made are then in any case destroyed when billions of birds that are sick and have weak immune systems need to be culled."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there are fewer incidences of avian influenza at present, but that does not mean that the virus has disappeared, and the danger of its mutating into a form of human influenza still exists."
"It would therefore be very serious to lose sight of the danger, just as it would be wrong to say that we are prepared."
"Let us therefore take advantage of this brief respite in order to fully contemplate the measures to be provided for."
"The European Union must take a firm stance."
"I would even say that, on behalf of the general interest, it must go beyond some of its prerogatives so as to perfectly coordinate its emergency plans, provided that such plans exist."
"They have to exist first."
"We need to overcome this schizophrenia, which consists in saying that the Member States' prerogatives must not be infringed."
"What will we say when a pandemic occurs?"
"Will we say that it is not our fault, that we are not responsible?"
"We are obliged to adapt our decisions to the context."
"In addition, it is important that the European Union provides its logistical and financial support to help develop vaccines."
"The laboratories are ready, but we must support their work, because, if they are to develop vaccines, they must see orders coming in, which are required for strategic stocks to be built up."
"It is only on this condition that we will prevent trafficking, which would be liable to develop in the event of a crisis, and that we will ensure that products designed to combat all types of epidemic are distributed fairly: vaccines, antiviral medications, masks and so on."
"Finally, Commissioner, what we need is an inventory from each Member State."
"Let each government commit to showing solidarity!"
"I can see from your reaction, Commissioner, that we cannot count on that happening."
"A selfish attitude faced with a worldwide epidemic would be completely at odds with the European spirit."
"What I fear, Commissioner, is that, in reality – and we know that this is the case – no one will be prepared in this affair, and that is well and truly the most serious aspect of all of this."
"– Mr President, the greatest threat that is repeatedly brought up in connection with bird flu is the appearance of a new virus sub-type that can be transferred from one human to another."
"Fortunately, we have not yet reached that stage, but even without this worst case scenario bird flu is a major threat to human health."
"The WHO uses a six-phase system of pandemic alerts in order to inform the world of the level of danger."
"We are currently in alert phase 3."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"His measures show what coordination and networking measures are and will be necessary in order to be better prepared for the situation."
"Bird flu is a global infectious disease, and I would therefore point out that this topic will also have a role to play at the ACP meeting taking place in Vienna next week and that we are going to adopt a resolution in this regard."
"Commissioner, both you and I have been addressed at many events and development policy discussions, and asked not only for the European Union to provide technical and financial aid to the developing countries to help deal with this problem, but also that we do not lay the burden of the fall in the poultry sector on the economic back of the developing countries by granting massive export subsidies and thereby once again destroying and damaging markets in these areas."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Adamou for his substantial report."
"I very much support what he has said today."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of improved cooperation and information-sharing between the Commission, European States and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"Each country has to take the measures best suited to fighting the influenza pandemic."
"However, no country can face the consequences of the pandemic alone."
"International cooperation is an absolute necessity if its impact is to be reduced."
"I therefore fully endorse the idea of creating a European taskforce which would be coordinated by the Commission and in which Parliament would be represented."
"This taskforce, which would bring together experts from the relevant fields, such as human and animal health, neurology and epidemiology, should work with representatives of the European vaccine and antiviral drugs industries."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Adamou on his excellent and detailed report, which is very good in terms of content."
"We have founded the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, in Stockholm in good time to ensure that we are equipped for our coming tasks."
"When it comes to the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the European added value of which we are all so fond is clear to see: joint planning, joint crisis management, joint coordination, joint logistics and joint travel restrictions are being implemented, and joint virostatics, joint vaccines and joint stockpiling are needed."
"We have solidarity in cases of disaster: Europe is called upon in cases of disaster, and joint action and cooperation have priority over subsidiarity."
"In this connection, we urgently require an open, honest and rapid exchange of information within the Member States, and the ECDC and the Commission need to collect and monitor this data."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission."
"I am very sparing with my words of thanks, which makes them all the more significant."
"Many thanks for so quickly agreeing to make EUR 100 000 million available for aid both here and in the developing world."
"I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their willingness to include the pandemic as part of the Solidarity Fund."
"We all hope that the pandemic will remain a fictional, theoretical exercise, and will never occur, but I am optimistic that we are well prepared for the possibility of an outbreak."
"Mr President, I come from the Dél-Alföld region of Hungary, which has been severely affected by disaster."
"In my native village, Szank, and in the surrounding area, 350 000 domestic poultry had to be destroyed in one week."
"All regulations of the European Commission have been complied with, and the Veterinary Authority designated the affected areas."
"The destruction of domestic poultry had actually started before the presence of bird flu was detected in laboratories."
"This was the right thing to do, because rapid action prevented the spread of the virus."
"It has been confirmed that the earlier strict anti-epidemic measures of the European Union had been correct."
"We are not asking the European Commission for more money, but for a more flexible attitude in the course of the reconciliation of the 2007-2013 rural development programmes, so that appropriate funds can be ensured for the poultry sector, farm reconstruction and new animal stock."
"Mr President, epidemics have swept over the world several times, leaving behind devastation and pain."
"I do not know whether our healthcare system will ever reach a point where we will be completely free of epidemics; in any case, it is certain that today we are still very far from such a situation."
"However, among all the uncertainties, we can be very certain of one thing: that we have never been as prepared to face the danger as we are now."
"I am glad that Parliament is debating this issue now, because we can see exactly where we stand, and what else we need to do in order to be truly as prepared as we can possibly be."
"Our preparedness for a potential flu epidemic is based on the national anti-pandemic plans coordinated by the European Commission."
"It is important to make sure that the plans also include technical actions, such as the determination of the areas that need to be isolated, the procurement of the appropriate virus-killing kits, the preparation of the list of those who should be vaccinated as a priority, the fair distribution of instruments to be used against the epidemic or the regulation of traffic and attitude at the workplace."
"It is essential that alongside the technical measures we also pay attention to communication tasks."
"In the event of a pandemic, the prevention of panic among the population of a Member State is at least as important as ensuring an accurate, rapid and reliable flow of information between Member States."
"Communication must involve all social groups and strata, and this can only be achieved by employing all available instruments in a concentrated manner."
"They say that problems always start at the top."
"Therefore it is essential that the coordinating organisations on all continents and at global level can cooperate harmoniously."
"In Europe, WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Commission must work together as closely as possible even now, in the preparation phase."
"I congratulate Mr Adamou for his own-initiative report."
"– Mr President, I wish first to thank all my honourable friends for their opinions and then to make two comments on what I have heard."
"Commissioner, I am sorry about the position of certain Member States who are reacting to the creation of a stockpile of anti-viral drugs."
"It would appear that they are forgetting the basic principle that prevention of disease is better than cure."
"I would repeat here what I said in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when we met, namely that the Member States should bear in mind that, if a pandemic breaks out, their entire budget will not be enough."
"That is why it is better that we prevent than that we cure."
"My second comment concerns the position taken by Mr Matsakis, who has the inalienable right to vote against the report, but who does not have the right to mislead the European Parliament by saying that the possible pandemic is a myth, given that all the scientific bodies and all the specialist scientists around the world are sounding the alarm bell and talking about millions of dead."
"The examples of the influenza in Spain and elsewhere, where we had millions of dead, are not far back."
"That is why what I would like to say to Mr Matsakis is that he has the right not to vote for the report, but he does not have the right to mislead the European Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate."
"Once again it has been confirmed that we have the same approach and that we see eye to eye on this issue."
"Almost all aspects of the preparedness plans are generic in nature."
"That means that, when we prepare for a possible flu pandemic, we are preparing not just for the possibility of avian flu, but for any flu pandemic and, when it comes to it, for any health threat."
"Since they are mostly generic in nature, they can be used in any kind of health threat and they are therefore a good investment on the part of the Member States and the Community that will not go to waste."
"We should all pray that they do go to waste, that we do not have a health crisis and will never actually need to use them, but nevertheless it is a good investment in preparedness, both for natural pandemics and for bioterrorism."
"We are much better prepared than we were last year or the year before."
"We have not yet reached the target and we can never actually say that we have."
"It is a continuous effort and there is always room for improvement, always a need to do more."
"Nevertheless, we have really come a long way, but we still have much to do."
"We still do not know a great deal about the specific virus."
"That is why we have invested so much in research into the specific avian flu virus and how it behaves."
"We have certain statistics, but given the areas where the virus usually occurs and is endemic, the reporting and monitoring is not as effective as in some other areas."
"We still lack data and will therefore be investing in this."
"I will not go into the animal health side, since we had an opportunity to discuss that recently in this House."
"However, the basic policy of the European Union, as well as the world community, is to make sure that avian flu remains an animal disease."
"In order to do that, we have to eradicate and deal with it effectively at the animal level."
"Cooperation is very important."
"We had the post-Beijing Conference in Vienna last week, where practical steps were discussed for implementing and fulfilling the pledges already made in Beijing."
"It is true that progress was slow."
"I am optimistic that things will speed up now."
"All the European Commission decisions required for the EUR 100 million pledged are in place now and it will start being spent on the various initiatives."
"The next meeting will be in Africa and will cover the problems of the region."
"I must remind you that the European Community has pledged money specifically for the African continent."
"I agree that it is very important to have the involvement of all services."
"That is what we have done in our specific plan and that is what we encourage Member States to do in their own national plans."
"There should be a lead preparedness and response authority, but all services in each Member State and at Community level as well should be involved."
"The interoperability of national plans is also very important and we have been working on that."
"I totally agree with those of you who raised the issue, for example, of borders closing."
"In the reality of the European Union, one Member State cannot close its borders or cancel flights from a specific place when we have the internal market and freedom of movement."
"We need cooperation and coordination."
"We have already set up the structures and mechanisms to achieve that at Community level."
"We have raised this issue at G8 level – international level – as well, proposing the ‘no first use’ principle, so that no G8 partner would close its borders and cancel flights without at least consulting the others in the group."
"I take your point on the issue of the institutions."
"As you know, we have been working on continuity of Commission services."
"We have also asked Parliament to look into this matter, and will be working closely with Parliament’s services to ensure continuity within Parliament and its meetings and services."
"Antivirals are certainly a debated issue."
"Antivirals are not a panacea, they are not a cure, they are the first line of defence and we have always said that."
"But as long as we do not have the pandemic virus, we will not have the pandemic vaccine which would be the basic defence."
"We are trying to shorten the period required to develop an approved licence and produce the vaccine, but we will need something in the meantime and antivirals are one solution."
"As regards the issue of stockpiles, it is not just that some Member States object to the principle, but there is also reluctance by many Member States on the funding of the stockpile."
"We explained that it will not be a substitute for national stockpiles."
"On the contrary, in our options paper we have introduced a condition that, in order to be able to benefit, a Member State will have to prove that it has actually begun creating its own national stockpile."
"That would be a great relief, not only for the Member States that are still in the process of developing stockpiles, but for the neighbouring countries as well, and for the WHO."
"The WHO would not then have to worry about the European region, because we would take care of ourselves and our neighbours and the WHO could concentrate on other regions in greater need than us."
"I totally agree with Mrs Grossetête, but I am afraid that was not the response we received."
"I was disappointed, but at the same time we have to be realistic."
"I do not want this debate to continue and then be used as an excuse for some Member States not to develop national stockpiles."
"Unless the Council changes the position, the Austrian Presidency, ‘challenges’ – if I can use the expression – the Member States to say they will be willing to review the position."
"It is important to emphasise that Member States will have to create their own national stockpiles."
"I totally agree that this is a question of solidarity."
"To be realistic, if we cannot agree on the solidarity principle now, what is going to happen if there is a crisis and one Member State has to share its medicine with other Member States, with all the citizens feeling threatened?"
"One of the weaknesses detected at the exercise last November was the unwillingness on the part of Member States to share medicine."
"We therefore need to establish solidarity now, when we can be more realistic in our approach than in a time of crisis."
"Then it can work in the way we would all wish."
"Nevertheless, we will try to coordinate the Member States and at least make sure that they take all the necessary steps for the sake of their individual citizens and European citizens in general."
"I will, as always, keep Parliament informed of every step we take."
"Mr President, I can see Mr Kyprianou leaving the Chamber, but he has not answered the question as to which countries will ultimately be withholding their solidarity."
"Mr Bowis was right to list a few names, but I should like to find out from the Commissioner if he can confirm them."
"It is of huge importance to me that we as MEPs do our jobs, but also that we can pass this expertise on to our colleagues in the national parliaments so that they can reprimand their governments when they fail to come up to the mark, and draw attention to the total lack of solidarity in this area."
"I believe that that is also what European democracy is all about, namely to pass on what we do in Europe to the national and regional parliaments."
"."
"Mr President, I am afraid that, as you know, the practice is that we do not release the individual positions taken in the Council."
"The Council takes decisions as a body and there was no such decision in that respect, which we regret."
"It is up to each Member State to disclose its position."
"We have to present the picture as a whole, which is why it would not be productive at this point to start naming individual Member States."
"It is a complicated issue and the position taken by each Member State would have to be explained in detail."
"I regret that it would not be useful to present specific names at this stage."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights in Tunisia."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, human rights is one of the issues addressed – and very intensively and on a very long-term basis – by the European Union’s network of treaties with third states, comprising association agreements, cooperation agreements, European Neighbourhood Policy action plans, and human rights, the common values of the European Union, are indeed an essential component part of them, not merely for legal reasons, but because this European Union defends certain values and takes care to see that third states do likewise."
"Among them, of course, is Tunisia, and the Council has indeed had good reason recently to be concerned about the human rights situation there."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say how regrettable I think it is that Mrs Flautre should herself have come to be on the receiving end of threats from the Tunisian security forces."
"On 5 June, the European Union lodged a very strong protest concerning these occurrences with the Tunisian foreign ministry."
"The upholding of human rights is a quite essential element in our dealings with Tunisia, just as much as it is in our relations with those third states with which we have agreements, and is set out as such in very clear terms in the association agreement with Tunisia and in the European Neighbourhood Policy action plan in respect of that country."
"As part of the action plan, which has been effective since 4 July 2005, Tunisia entered into a number of very specific obligations concerning democracy, responsible governance and human rights, and there is no doubt about the fact that practical compliance with these obligations is of major importance in terms of the further development of the European Union’s relations with Tunisia."
"One thing to which the country committed itself was the establishment of a sub-committee on human rights."
"We strongly invite our Tunisian partners to make it possible for this sub-committee to hold its first meeting in the coming months."
"The European Union wants to deepen dialogue on these important issues before this year is out."
"It is obvious that the European Union would like to see Tunisia – like every other third state – becoming stronger and more prosperous, while at the same time making progress in those areas where there may be deficits, as is the case, in many instances, where human rights are concerned."
"It has to be said that international reports, statistics and rankings point to Tunisia enjoying good, and indeed impressive, economic rights and social advances."
"The EU very much welcomes Tunisia’s efforts, particularly as regards the position of women, the right to education and other issues."
"That an Arab country should make very definite progress in these areas is important for the Arab world as a whole, and so are the positive steps that have been taken in recent months, and we do – as we should – acknowledge them, such as, for example, the opening up of the prisons to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the appointment of a mediator and the amnesty for political prisoners."
"Since Tunisia is one of the most important countries with the capacity for serving as an example to the Arab world, we also hope that we will be able to work together with it within the new UN Human Rights Council in a constructive manner."
"None of this, however, can conceal the fact that the human rights situation in Tunisia does, in many respects, give cause for concern, particularly as regards the right of expression of opinion, freedom of association and freedom of assembly, not to mention the independence of the judiciary."
"In particular, the events before and during last November’s world summit on the information society in Tunis still cast a shadow over Tunisia."
"Following these occurrences, we gave Tunisia a public and clear reminder of the European Union’s expectations of it as regards the discharge of its obligations and responsibilities in matters of human rights."
"On the occasion of a human rights démarche by the EU in November 2005, we underlined our regret at the occurrences at the World Summit and reiterated our core concerns, which were, firstly, that an end should be put to the blocking of EU-funded civil society projects; secondly, that progress should be made in the implementation of the programme of judicial reform; and, thirdly, that a sub-committee for human rights should be set up."
"There is no doubt that these démarches were a first step, and the Commission and the Council have closely monitored developments since November."
"As the Austrian Presidency of the Council began at the start of this year, a number of accommodating gestures were in fact seen to be made, including the signature, in December 2005, of the financial agreement for the MEDA programme for the modernisation of the justice system, and the release of EU funds for two NGOs."
"However, the funds for the oldest and most respected human rights organisation on the African continent, the existence of which the Tunisian authorities themselves describe as an remained blocked, which, indeed, they still are."
"The organisation to which I refer is the whose complaints about the police’s attempts at intimidating its members and at interfering with its proper functioning have not since then been resolved."
"As long ago as September 2005, the organisation was prevented from holding its General Meeting pending a court ruling that is still awaited."
"The EU troika’s response to this was to embark on a démarche in Geneva in order to back up the EU’s desire that the League might be allowed to continue its work without hindrance."
"I am sure that the Commission, too, would like to say something about the blocking of the funds it has allocated to the League, but I do not myself propose to say anything further on the subject."
"Despite a further démarche by the European Union on 22 May this year, the League was again prevented from holding its General Meeting on 27 and 28 May, when police were deployed in a disproportionate manner against peaceful activists, and, regrettably, the chairwoman of your House’s Human Rights Committee, Mrs Flautre, was not only a witness to this but also a victim of it."
"I would like to take this opportunity to point out that repeated occurrences of this kind do damage to a country's image in the eyes of the world at large."
"Following our exchange of views with the Tunisian foreign minister on 5 June, the Presidency has taken further steps by way of response to these occurrences."
"The meeting of the association committee in Tunis, scheduled for July 2006, will offer us an appropriate context for a debate in which these events can be addressed, and we are also willing to engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with you, in this House, on that subject."
"I would like, by way of conclusion, to make a number of further observations on other developments in the human rights sphere, to which this resolution of your House makes reference, and which are also a cause for concern to the Council."
"Freedom of association – albeit within certain limits – is enshrined in the Tunisian constitution; as is so often the case with human rights issues, the law or the constitution is very much up to standard, but what matters is the way these are implemented and enforced."
"The Tunisian constitution also guarantees the independence of the judiciary, but, on the other hand, there are numerous reports of the authorities interfering in court cases."
"The case brought against the lawyer Mohammad Abou, which, as you know, was brought against him after he published a critical article online, would appear to back up these accusations."
"Let me now conclude by stressing that European Union is very interested in cooperating with Tunisia in modernising its justice system, for which purpose it has allocated funds as part of the MEDA programme, and it takes a great interest in the progress achieved in putting this project into effect."
"Speaking on behalf of the Council, I can assure you that the European Union will continue to be firm in raising human rights issues and concerns with Tunisia and will be demanding of the Tunisian authorities that they apply the principles of human rights and democracy across the board."
"In so doing, our first priority has to do with the discharge of the obligations concerning democracy, responsible governance and human rights, given by Tunisia to the European Union in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"We have left Tunisia in no doubt that it is on compliance with these obligations that the further development of our relationship will depend."
"."
"Mr President, the Commission is closely following the human rights situation in Tunisia."
"It is using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Tunisian authorities to make progress in this crucial area."
"It is particularly concerned over breaches of fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, association and assembly."
"My colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in her bilateral contacts with the Tunisian authorities, including her latest visit to Tunisia in October 2005, has systematically pointed to the importance of respecting human rights and developing a free, open and participative civil society."
"The Commission has also closely followed the events and incidents that occurred during the congress of the on 27 May."
"On that day, despite a warning note from the Tunisian authorities, a representative of the delegation of the European Commission attended the congress of that league."
"He therefore witnessed what happened and was able to provide support to the representative of the European Parliament, Mrs Flautre, who also participated in the event."
"I very much regret that she was threatened by the security services and find this totally unacceptable."
"Hence, on 5 June 2006, a meeting took place between the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Abdallah, and the EU Ambassadors in Tunisia."
"The head of the Commission delegation underlined on that occasion that the presence of the Commission observers and parliamentary observers at the congress of the was quite legitimate."
"Unfortunately, the Tunisian authorities remain reticent over the issue of this league."
"In more general terms, I wish to remind you that the Commission is committed to providing support for the promotion of human rights and the development of civil society in Tunisia, including this human rights league."
"In that context, the Commission deeply regrets the continued blockage by the Tunisian authorities of EU efforts in support of civil society, particularly under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"We shall continue to press the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock these."
"With regard to the future, it is our firm intention – shared with the Council – to use neighbourhood instruments as a lever in the field of human rights."
"The EU-Tunisia Neighbourhood Action Plan includes sweeping commitments in the field of human rights, democracy and better governance."
"Moreover, it provides for the creation of a human rights subcommittee where the implementation of such commitments will be jointly assessed and monitored."
"On 2 June 2006 – just two weeks ago – the Commission submitted to the Tunisian authorities the draft internal regulation of the abovementioned subcommittee and is awaiting a reply from the Tunisian side."
"I therefore want to firmly reassure you that the Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that the provisions of the association agreement and of the EU-Tunisia action plan with regard to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are being duly implemented."
"."
"Mr President, Tunisia is one of our partner countries in the Barcelona Process, and thus there should be interest, from both sides and not only from ours, in order to ensure that the commitments made in this process are observed, including those regarding the respect for human rights."
"Yet, Mr President, we also need to be cautious, without jumping to any hurried conclusions."
"This is the third time in around six months that this Parliament is discussing the resolution on human rights in Tunisia."
"This is out of tune with what we say and also with what we do not say about other countries, including some of our partner countries in the Mediterranean where the human rights situation is certainly no better than that of Tunisia."
"To be clear, I consider that Tunisia has a great deal more to be done in this field."
"On our part, however, we also need to send a message to Tunisia which is just, balanced, coherent, and treat all countries in the same way."
"After all, we are speaking of a country which has already made a degree of progress, as Minister Winkler mentioned in his intervention."
"We are talking about a country which has just been elected into the Human Rights Council of the United Nations."
"This is a country which has also just took over the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"Mr President, I do not know how coherent we are being by insisting on maintaining the Congress of the Tunisian League for Human Rights when we know that there is an order from the Tunisian Court for this Congress not to take place."
"What are we expecting: that the order of the Court be challenged or ignored?"
"Would it then not be better, rather than condemning, to solicit dialogue between all parties involved?"
"Would it not also be better to ask the Tunisian authorities to participate as well in order for a solution to be found?"
"Undoubtedly, it is important for this Congress to be held, yet we know that there is a blockage due to this Court order, and we need the commitment of all parties in order for this impasse to be unblocked."
"Even with regards to the law on the superior institute of lawyers which has just been passed, what exactly are we saying?"
"Are we saying that there has been a breach of human rights because no consultation was made on this law before it was passed?"
"Because if this is what we are saying, then we should admit that there is a large number of Member States of the European Union itself which are also breaching human rights due to lack of consultation."
"To conclude, Mr President, I repeat that I wish to see a Tunisia which safeguards human rights a lot, lot more, but I also want to see that we send this message in a constructive manner."
"."
"Mr President, we are concerned here with the third resolution that we are proposing that the European Parliament adopt on human rights in Tunisia."
"With the Commission and the Council having followed the same line as our Assembly last September and December, we had a right to hope that Tunisia would respect its European commitments."
"Nothing of the sort happened, as the ban on holding the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League and the recent forceful interventions against human rights activists and legal professionals demonstrate."
"Just as serious is the way in which the agreement with the European Union on the reform of the judiciary is being misused."
"This agreement, which was signed in December 2005, was intended to mark real progress in terms of respect for human rights in that country and, above all, to guarantee a genuinely independent status for the judiciary."
"The only measure taken in connection with the association agreement has therefore been harmed by the fact that the law establishing the lawyers’ training institute was imposed without the opinion of the Bar and placed under the exclusive authority of the executive."
"Not only have the commitments made by Tunisia not been fulfilled but, furthermore, the expected progress has not been observed."
"Quite the contrary, the latest events reflect a worsening of the situation and amount to a form of provocation towards the European Union, given that respect for human rights underpins the EU-Tunisia partnership."
"There is therefore no use in confining oneself to words and hopes."
"What we expect from the Commission and from the Council are acts, since the pedagogy of dialogue does not seem to be enough."
"We therefore call for an Association Council to be convened quickly, for the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League to be held without any restrictions, for the funds earmarked for civil society to be released and for the acts of intimidation and harassment to stop."
"Furthermore, we are calling for all of those measures that will be considered appropriate where adopting our resolution is concerned to be accompanied by a precise and fixed timeframe, so that no one can be unaware of the reciprocal commitments that link the European Union and Tunisia."
"."
"Mr President, today’s debate is a repeat of the one that we held exactly six months ago, on 13 December 2005."
"The Presidency concluded its speech back then in the same manner as today’s speech."
"I quote: ‘It is now time for us to look forward to the implementation by the Tunisian authorities of the commitments made by President Ben Ali."
"Implementation of these commitments will be an essential element in developing EU-Tunisia relations'."
"Since then, steps have indeed been taken by the European Union, but those steps have clearly shown their limits."
"The deployment of Tunisian police officers and their violent behaviour – which I have witnessed first-hand – prevented the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League from being held at the end of May, but not, Mr Busuttil, as a result of a court ruling, given that 32 court actions have been taken against the LTDH."
"This is well and truly a case of legal harassment."
"The funds allocated to the associations are still frozen."
"A great many independent NGOs and political parties are still being denied the right to exist."
"The judiciary is still being repressed."
"Mr Abou is still in prison, and the harassment directed towards not only him, but also towards his wife, takes place on a daily basis."
"You have announced to us, Mr Winkler, that an Association Committee will meet in July."
"Is that the response to the formal request made by the European Parliament, in December, for an urgent meeting of the Association Committee aimed at looking into the priority issue of human rights in Tunisia?"
"That being the case, it is quite logical that the Tunisian authorities are acting with a growing sense of impunity."
"I will turn once again to you, Mr Winkler: how might one justify the fact that the Austrian representative did not even think it useful to travel to the Congress, and that he clearly did everything in his power to hamper the action taken by the European Union on the ground?"
"Only two Member States were present at the Congress of the LTDH."
"Finally, I must emphasise the so-called ‘reform and justice' project."
"The Tunisian authorities have just succeeded in passing a project establishing a lawyers’ training institute against the unanimous opinion of the Bar Council."
"The Tunisian authorities still refuse, to this day, to authorise the visit of a United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, while the magistrates’ association has simply been disbanded and replaced."
"How can we believe, under these circumstances, that the Tunisian authorities have the slightest intention of safeguarding the independence of the judicial system?"
"Commissioner, I believe that we must suspend this entire project in order to review it and that we must make the completion of the project and the payment of EU funds subject to certain conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the violation of human rights in Tunisia has now taken a shocking turn."
"The Tunisian Government has prevented the Tunisian League for Human Rights from holding its congress by deploying police and secret services."
"That is unacceptable."
"I must point out that the Tunisian league is an integral part of the International League for Human Rights, which is a key partner in discussions with EU institutions."
"Not only did the police physically prevent the meeting from taking place, but they also mistreated our fellow Member Mrs Flautre, to whom I offer my full personal solidarity and that of our parliamentary group as a whole."
"I should also like to extend our solidarity to Mr Mokhtar Trifi, the president of the Tunisian League for Human Rights, and all his colleagues."
"I must also point out that the funds that the Commission has allocated for projects to promote human rights remain blocked."
"The whole European Union is politically being held hostage by a government that has decided to trample on human rights."
"The time has come, therefore, to react."
"The European Commission must stop hiding behind the divisions within the Council of the European Union and behind the vetoes imposed by France in particular."
"I formally call for the Commission to start the procedures for calling an extraordinary meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council, in order to evaluate the state of political and civil liberties in the country."
"We must not be afraid to raise the additional possibility of suspending the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement on the basis of Article 2 thereof."
"I say this also in my capacity as rapporteur on the democratic clause, which was unanimously approved by the European Parliament and gives us full political legitimacy to call for suspension of the agreement and to ask for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to be urgently convened."
"The Commission and the Council, on the other hand, tell us that they intend to continue cowering to a despotic government that, from Tunis, thinks it can tell them what to do in Brussels."
"In that case, however, I do not think that Parliament will be on your side."
"."
"Mr President, sadly, I have little time, but some of my predecessors have seen themselves granted certain favours, and I request the same treatment."
"My group should like to point out that, contrary to what people are so fond of believing in this House, there is no unanimous desire to pick a fight, in the field of human rights, with the government of Tunisia, a friendly country if ever there was one."
"That was, moreover, the tone of the speech made by my excellent fellow Member, Mr Busuttil, which I support."
"Firstly, many believe that the internal disputes within the Human Rights League - which, I might add, are obscure Tunisian disputes - should not be resolved by the European Parliament."
"That is not our role."
"Secondly, many of us are delighted to see that a country of the South is progressing so well on the path to development, and has been doing so for many years now, and that it might eventually become a genuine developed country and, as such, serve as an example to the whole of the Arab world, and perhaps even to the whole of Africa."
"Our admiration for Tunisia is all the more profound because its government is able to keep what are, as we know, ever-recurring and ever-threatening waves of fundamentalism and religious fanaticism at bay."
"Many of us are surprised, too, that some people should be obsessed with this country to the point where they devote the bulk of their term in office to trying by all possible means to heap opprobrium on it."
"That is strange to say the least."
"Finally, many wonder about the constant recourse to this ‘double standards’ principle."
"We are very fussy about human rights with some countries, especially when they escape the influence of the United States and the English-speaking world, but we are much less so with others, including the Member States."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has already been said in this debate, with some conflicting points made at times."
"I should therefore like to say to you straightaway that I do not wish to go back over the unacceptable events that have taken place and that are, moreover, taking place every day in Tunisia."
"I believe - and this is undoubtedly what a number of Members of this Parliament are waiting for - that we must go beyond the stage of condemning this kind of event, otherwise we will never stop having to do so."
"What we want now – and several of us have said so – is action, that is to say practical decisions by the Council and the Commission regarding Tunisia on account of the incessant human rights violations of which the country is guilty."
"We have the means to put pressure on the Tunisian Government, let us use them!"
"In this regard, I am delighted by what I heard from the Council’s representative, namely that the sub-committee on human rights is being convened."
"This response is overdue, but, if it were able to be implemented, it would be a good thing."
"It has become urgent, as others have said, to convene the Association Council provided for by the agreement between the Union and Tunisia and to impose on the latter a binding schedule in which respect for human rights must be the central issue to be settled."
"For fear of losing credibility on the international stage, the Union must, in my opinion, have the courage to make strong political decisions, and I join Mrs Flautre in calling for the suspension of all cooperation with Tunisia."
"I will conclude, Mr President, by saying this: the resolution that we are going to vote on is targeted at the other European institutions, but it must also attract the attention of Europeans, many of whom sunbathe each year on the beaches of Djerba and of Tunisia in general, and remind them that, just a stone's throw from their beaches, are prisons in which democrats are rotting away."
"Mr President, Tunisia is a key country in the Euro-Mediterranean process."
"This is demonstrated by the fact that it has had an Association Agreement since 1998 and an action plan since 2005 and that its Parliament has presided over the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly for the last couple of months."
"That is precisely what makes the things happening in that country in terms of human rights violations even more serious."
"In reply to Mr Busuttil, when he says that we spend too much time on Tunisia, I would say that what we cannot do is abandon a friend as an impossible case and we will therefore have to produce as many resolutions as are needed."
"We must not allow the Tunisian authorities to believe that, however much we talk about human rights violations, we will get tired of it and shut up."
"That would be unfair to the Euro-Mediterranean process, it would be unfair to the Tunisian people and it would be unfair to ourselves."
"The fact that Tunisia acts badly cannot be allowed to justify others also acting badly."
"That is the political problem we are facing, Mr President."
"The Euro-Mediterranean process is a success, but there is at least one issue in relation to which we have not yet achieved our objective, and that is that respect for human rights should be the norm in the politics of all the countries involved in this process."
"What has happened in Tunisia is the latest example, but it will not be the last, unfortunately."
"I would therefore call upon the Tunisian authorities to think in terms of becoming a model of a secular and democratic State, that respects human rights, and to stop being a model of a secular State that does not respect human rights, and they understand perfectly well what I mean by that."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as several speakers have pointed out, Tunisia is a partner of ours, and I believe that it is important that we should treat it as one, without ignoring all the difficulties involved."
"You have also pointed out that this is a country that serves as an example to others, that it plays an important part in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and that our striving for a dialogue between religions and civilisations makes it important that we should keep on talking to a secular and moderate Islamic country."
"It is for that reason that I believe that the political and diplomatic measures for which we opt in addressing violations of human rights – and nobody will deny that the human rights situation in Tunisia is unsatisfactory – must be proportionate, and what that means is that we should try to take the sort of action that brings results, while also – and this is where I can do no other than agree with Mr Busuttil – maintaining our own credibility by means of a consistent, coherent and clear human rights policy."
"Mrs Trautmann laid particular emphasis on cooperation in the judicial sphere, and this is something that strikes me as particularly important."
"Being a lawyer myself, and having practised as one for many years, I cannot do other than endorse that view, for an independent and operational justice system is crucial to the functioning of a democracy."
"I therefore believe that we and the Commission must support and foster those projects and work with Tunisia towards an independent and functioning justice system."
"Several speakers also said that nothing has been done about the demand for an urgent meeting of the Association Council."
"Perhaps I might remind you that the calling of an Association Council meeting requires the consent of both parties, but this Association Council will now convene in July, when it is not a matter of doubt that we will use this opportunity to express to Tunisia our disquiet, our concern and our expectations."
"I do believe, then, that we should press on with our policy, which is a very coherent one aimed at improving the human rights situation in Tunisia, and I do think we are on the right track here."
"As I indeed said in my introductory remarks, some progress has been made, and I trust that it will be possible for more to be achieved."
"You may be assured that the Council and, I am sure, the Commission, too, will maintain a consistent line on this matter."
"."
"Mr President, it is clear that the situation in Tunisia as regards human rights continues to be very serious, not least where freedom of expression is concerned."
"Both international and local human rights organisations, unfortunately, report an increasing number of cases of concern."
"This must be the starting point for our assessment and our policy, where human rights are taken as the key priority."
"The Commission will continue closely to monitor developments and will use all the means at its disposal to improve the situation."
"For instance, I hope that the EU-Tunisia sub-committee on human rights and democracy will soon be up and running."
"Tunisia has already informally stated that individual cases will be raised, notably in the framework of its political dialogue meetings with the European Union."
"It is evident that a dialogue on human rights must also include individual cases."
"I have some experience on this as regards the candidate countries, where it is linked to our rigorous conditionality."
"The application of conditionality is essential for the use of the ‘soft’ power that the European Union has at its disposal."
"I hope that conditions can be established for a fair and smooth implementation of the MEDA project on modernisation of the judiciary, to which there was a reference, a project for which we have a budget of EUR 22 million."
"That would be an important step forward in enhancing reform and modernisation of the judiciary through the MEDA programme."
"To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions(1), pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the 17th EU-Russia Summit (26 May 2006)."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as both the Federal Chancellor himself, the Foreign Minister, and I myself have already told you, relations with Russia are of particular strategic significance, and it is therefore obvious that the Austrian Presidency treated this 17th EU-Russia summit in Sochi on the Black Sea on 25 May as a special priority."
"In essence, the summit considered important issues in our relations with Russia, including the implementation of the common roadmap, the situation in the EU and in the Russian Federation, and future treaty relationships, but also international issues."
"At the heart of discussions, though, and for reasons that will be obvious to you, was the important topic of energy."
"As you are all aware, only a few hours into the presidency, something occurred that the Federal Chancellor has termed a ‘wake up call’, and that has resulted in the European Union developing a deeper interest in this topic."
"I would also like to remind your House of the conclusions from the March European Council."
"The issue of relations in matters concerning energy, particularly with Russia, has also been the subject of in-depth internal debate within the European Union, and so the summit offered a good initial opportunity for talks with President Putin about the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which triggered the January crisis."
"Although President Putin strongly defended Russia's actions and tried to explain them, he was very struck by the strength of the European Union’s reaction in this matter."
"Not only did the March European Council, for the first time, lay the foundations of a European energy policy, but it also had an impact on discussions in Russia."
"The European Council at the end of this week will be taking a paper by the High Representative and the Commission as the basis for deliberations on the external dimension of the European Union’s energy policy, which will also take account of the positions expressed by Russia at the summit."
"The deliberations of the G8, which are to meet in St Petersburg in July, will also take account of the discussion on energy at the summit."
"You will be aware that, under the Russian presidency, the main topic of the G8 is the security of energy supply."
"We have seized this opportunity for a thorough, honest and frank dialogue on energy matters."
"The European Union has made it clear that Russia must be – as it indeed was and is – a reliable partner in the energy sphere, but we have, nonetheless, expressed our concern at the effects on the EU of the January gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine and emphatically pointed out that our relationship in this area must be founded on mutuality, not only as regards access to markets, but also as regards infrastructure and investments."
"We also emphasised the significance, where competition is concerned, of the principles of transparency and openness, and strongly urged Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty."
"President Putin, by way of response to this, gave an assurance that Russia would continue to be a reliable energy supplier, while, at the same time, not excluding the possibility of Russia ratifying the Energy Charter Treaty in the long term."
"Until that happened, though, he said that cooperation should be on a case-by-case basis, and pointed out that there was already substantial foreign investment in the Russian energy sector, to a considerably greater extent than in many other energy-producing countries."
"He took the view that the mutual approach would make sense only if the European Union were itself prepared to allow Russia access to resources that it saw as being as significant for it as energy resources were to Russia."
"It became evident that the European Union and Russia had decidedly different views as to the shape that future cooperation should take, but it should be noted on the positive side that the EU-Russia summit saw the subject being handled in a frank, positive and productive fashion, with both sides agreeing that the energy dialogue, having already been begun, should be continued with to a greater extent and in greater depth."
"In particular, President Putin clarified his desire to build bridges despite the differences and work towards an agreement with the EU."
"At the summit, both sides stressed their mutual dependency where energy was concerned and emphasised that the EU and Russia had to define their relations in this crucial area by mutual agreement."
"The summit did, of course, include discussion of other issues."
"One of these was the possibility of Russia joining the WTO."
"Russia has decided to conclude negotiations before the end of this year in order to be able to join in 2007."
"We reassured them of our support and reiterated our willingness to then draft a ‘free trade agreement plus’ with Russia within the framework of a future comprehensive treaty that would be intended to replace the partnership and cooperation agreement that is, albeit due to expire, already in place."
"Russia reiterated its desire that the work on a new treaty of this kind between it and the EU should be brought forward with all speed."
"It was agreed that this treaty should be as comprehensive and durable as possible in line with the needs and dynamics of the relations between us, and that, in order to avoid a vacuum, the existing agreement should continue to apply until such time as the new treaty entered into force."
"We were particularly pleased that it was possible, at the summit, to sign visa facilitation and readmission agreements on the basis of the agreement reached at the end of the previous year under the UK’s presidency."
"These agreements will make both business traffic and interpersonal contact considerably easier."
"The European Union regards the conclusion of a readmission agreement with Russia as a major success and as being of great significance."
"This agreement is also a demonstration of the productivity of the relations between the EU and Russia and of the real benefit that our people derive from them."
"Further to it, we have again urged Russia to take steps to ensure that the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia can be ratified."
"It goes without saying that human rights issues, too, were raised at this summit."
"In discussing the situation in Chechnya, we welcomed the agreement with the Commission on the modalities for the implementation of a EUR 20 million programme in support of socio-economic recovery in the Northern Caucasus."
"We also made reference to the consultations on human rights, the third round of which was held in Vienna in March, and which has become an essential element in relations between us."
"Finally, I would also like to mention the fact that the deliberations also focused on international issues and, in particular, on the situation in Iran."
"We also addressed the situation in Belarus and reiterated our willingness to work together with Russia towards a resolution of the so-called ‘frozen conflicts’ in Moldova and Georgia."
"It finally proved possible, at the summit, to reach agreement on an Institute for European Studies in Moscow, to be funded jointly by the EU and Russia."
"All things considered, this was a good summit with free and frank discussions in a friendly atmosphere, with both sides being willing, despite their differences, to build bridges and find solutions for the problems they both face."
"."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to report, on behalf of the Commission, President Barroso and my colleague Ms Ferrero-Waldner, on the EU-Russia Summit which took place in Sochi on 25 May."
"The summit took place one year after the adoption of the four roadmaps for the Common Spaces and thus provided a good opportunity to review the progress made since then."
"The summit was the occasion for the signature of the visa facilitation and readmission agreements."
"The visa facilitation agreement will help encourage contacts between the peoples of the EU and Russia."
"The readmission agreement will help tackle illegal immigration, an issue of growing concern to both the EU and Russia."
"At the summit, there was a very open, frank and substantive discussion with President Putin on energy."
"It was never our expectation that we would find complete agreement in Sochi, but the Summit did clarify our respective positions."
"That was extremely helpful as we prepare for the European Council discussions on the external aspects of EU energy policy on the basis of the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative."
"The EU and Russia are and certainly will remain interdependent in the energy sector and there is a genuine opportunity to integrate EU and Russian energy markets in a mutually beneficial, reciprocal, transparent and non-discriminatory manner."
"In that regard, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with Russia both bilaterally and multilaterally at next month’s G8 Summit."
"As for the future framework for EU-Russia relations, the Summit agreed that our aim should be to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with a new, durable, comprehensive and legally-binding agreement which should be capable of promoting the further development of EU-Russia relations."
"The PCA would remain in place until a new agreement comes into force."
"The Commission is currently preparing draft negotiating directives to that effect."
"If the Council is in a position to adopt them by the next EU-Russia Summit, negotiations could begin by the end of this year."
"For both the EU and Russia, Russia’s WTO accession remains a key priority."
"This will lay the foundations for bringing EU-Russia trade and economic relations to a qualitatively new level in the context of the PCA successor agreement, taking into account the existing PCA objective of a free trade area."
"In that context, let me report to Parliament that we are making good progress on agreeing a new framework document for the renovated Northern Dimension policy."
"The Commission is negotiating the text with Russia, Norway and Iceland."
"I am pleased to say that Russia shows every interest in confirming its joint ownership of the Northern Dimension policy."
"We hope to have an agreement in time for the senior officials’ meeting in Finland in September."
"We will keep Parliament informed and seek to ensure that the parliamentary dimension is included in the new policy."
"International issues were discussed in depth at the summit."
"The dialogue which has developed with Russia over recent months, in particular on Iran and the Middle East, is a sound example of the EU and Russia working to put the concept of effective multilateralism into practice."
"The EU also emphasised the need to work together with Russia on issues in our common neighbourhood."
"We remain firmly of the view that the resolution of the frozen conflicts and the development of democracy and market economy in the countries of the region represent the best route to ensuring a stable, peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood for both the EU and Russia."
"A number of other sensitive issues were discussed in a constructive spirit at the summit."
"The EU stressed the importance of Russia ratifying the border agreement with Estonia and signing and ratifying the border agreement with Latvia."
"In that context, let me welcome the recent meeting between Prime Ministers Kalvitis and Fradkov and hope that this represents the start of an intensified bilateral dialogue."
"The EU also raised its continuing concerns with regard to the situation in Chechnya, notably in the light of the most recent visit by the UN High Representative for Human Rights, Louise Arbour."
"The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations continue to provide a useful forum for addressing these issues."
"In conclusion, the summit demonstrated the breadth and depth of our common policy agenda with Russia."
"As the EU-Russia strategic partnership develops, the need for EU coherence becomes all the more essential."
"The dialogue the Commission has with the European Parliament on Russia is therefore a very important element in this regard in enhancing coherence, coexistence and the effectiveness of EU policy vis-à-vis the Russian Federation."
"."
"Mr President, there is no doubt as to the importance of cooperation between the European Union and Russia."
"While we must, more than ever, try to enjoy the benefits of that relationship, we must also have the courage to address the difficult areas with each other."
"That is why it is necessary for Europe, more than ever, to speak with one voice."
"So, then, let us hear no more of German Chancellors who claim that Russia is a fantastic democracy, while other countries try to improve the human rights situation in that country."
"There is now hope of a new beginning in that respect."
"Although our cooperation is based on four common areas, we cannot but conclude that this cooperation is not sufficiently strategic or pragmatic."
"Economically, barriers have been lowered and we have gained benefits, but with regard to the other three common areas, there has been too little in the way of real progress."
"It is important, though, to get this balance right."
"We must avoid creating the impression that human rights are temporarily secondary to economic interests or gas interests."
"We must strike the right balance whilst keeping the channels of communication open."
"With regard to energy, as was said a moment ago, we must pursue not only a sustainable relationship between supplier and customer, but also prevent Russia from using gas as a political lever in future."
"Human rights should also be expressly laid down in the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007, such agreement not just involving consultation among politicians, but from now on also permanent contributions from international and national independent NGOs."
"Finally, if Russia does actually want to join the World Trade Organisation, it will have to abide by WTO standards from now on."
"We should, accordingly, heap criticism on Russia, not only for the economic sanctions against Georgia and Moldova, but also for the on-going trade conflict with Poland."
"Commissioner, this has been going on for months, and is now also a European responsibility."
"Can you indicate how we can resolve this on-going conflict as soon as possible?"
"Whatever happens, the common approach is paramount and that is what we must focus on now more than ever."
"I think that the common resolution as it is now before us is a good starting point for Parliament and I, as delegation chairman, should like to pass it on to our counterparts in Russia next week."
"Mr President, I would concur with Mr Eurlings’ final remarks."
"We have drafted an excellent joint resolution covering many aspects which I cannot repeat in the two minutes allotted to me."
"I also share Mr Eurlings' criticism of the somewhat pragmatic way in which cooperation with the Russian Federation is fleshed out by working in those four areas."
"Taking practical steps is, in principle, to be welcomed, as was demonstrated recently with visa facilitation between the EU and Russia, although this gets a little in the way of the balance that should be struck between the different areas we regard as important."
"Policy should not become fragmented, which is exactly what is at risk of happening with the system of the four areas and the steps that are taken within each of those."
"We must continue to look for a common denominator in respect of this cooperation."
"Three elements are important in this."
"Energy has already been mentioned."
"We need a more transparent way of working together, which should indeed involve us refraining from exerting political pressures, as is occasionally done in the area of energy."
"Secondly, we must enter into a critical human rights dialogue with Russia about the situation within Russia itself, about the Chechens, about the NGOs, about the authoritarian tendencies which the government is increasingly adopting, but also about democracy in its immediate neighbourhood, such as Belarus, in particular."
"Thirdly, we must look for solutions for a number of security problems in the region in which respect Russia has not, as yet, made any really constructive contribution – Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan spring to mind."
"It is important, in our view, that justice should be done to all three elements."
"We should not give preferential treatment to one element to the detriment of the others."
"Accordingly, gas should not take priority over democracy, or vice versa."
"All three elements I mentioned must be central on the common agenda."
"This year is a good time for this."
"We can talk to Russia because it is chairing the G8 and because it occupies the presidency, no less, of the Council of Europe."
"There is a certain tension if you want to play on all three fields at once, but that tension is normal when foreign policy is involved, when Russia is involved, and in that sense we must try to be clear in our policy by emphasising all three elements and not backing away from a critical dialogue about the things in Russia that we do not find agreeable."
"Mr President, I shall deal only with the visa agreement."
"We say that we want to simplify visa procedures, but on closer inspection of the bilateral agreement between the EU and Russia, it becomes apparent that there are, in fact, very few simplifications associated with the agreement."
"The agreement will affect only a small percentage of travellers."
"Although the groups involved are important ones, such as students, participants in organised programmes and business travellers, the question must be asked as to what the situation is for other groups, in other words for the great majority who really would benefit from seeing something of the world."
"Is it desirable to be categorising people in the modern world?"
"For the average traveller, that is to say for more than 90% of those wanting to travel, the agreement will provide no simplifications at all."
"It will still, for example, be impossible to make a private car journey to Russia."
"This is because the jungle-like mess of requirements relating to invitations and mandatory registrations is not going to be overhauled."
"It will also remain unclear how the introduction of what are known as biometric data is to be linked to the visa procedure."
"For me, it is a mystery why this agreement has not been linked to the international Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction."
"Every year, for example, a number of children are abducted to Russia from my home country, Finland, in each case by the Russian half of the parental couple."
"There is no legal recourse for bringing the children back home to the other parent."
"All this is obvious."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe hope for a sympathetic hearing for these concerns from the other groups."
"A chimera of an agreement will always be just that – this needs to be said loud and clear."
"The agreement makes a difference to too few people and does not sufficiently simplify the actual visa process."
"This problem applies both to those people wanting to travel to Russia and to those wanting to enter the Schengen area."
"To simply blame the weak result on the Russians is not the job of this Parliament."
"We must be able to assess the whole picture and set goals for social intercourse with our neighbours."
"That is the task for which we were elected."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the relaxed visa regime for students and sportsmen is a first step, the return of illegal immigrants is highly questionable, and there are many other questions to which the May summit produced no answers."
"There can be no successful modernisation of the state apparatus, of the economy and of the armed forces if there is a lack of will on the part of the government and of interest on the part of the predatory capitalists who are only after profit with dirty money."
"The rule of law and the democratisation of the country are being hamstrung; the violations of human rights in Chechnya are a tragedy."
"The new law on non-governmental organisations is curtailing the rights of civil society and the freedom of expression."
"Critics of the regime are treated in ways that run counter to the standards of the Council of Europe, with political prisoners such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev – the latter of whom is seriously ill – being subject to physical assault and psychological intimidation."
"The legal system being under the thumb of politicians, it is an open question as to whether Russia is a reliable source of energy."
"Europe would be playing with danger if it were to make itself too dependent."
"What the gas supply dispute with Ukraine at the beginning of the year showed us was that Europe, too, could see its supply turned off in the event of a dispute."
"Transparency and good governance are mentioned, but there is not enough evidence of them."
"The Yukos case exemplifies the need for the government to disclose the ways in which the state and the energy companies are interconnected and mutually dependent."
"At the time of the elections in Belarus, the EU charged Lukashenko with electoral fraud, authoritarianism and corruption."
"Putin, on the other hand, congratulated his ally on his victory."
"It is because we regard democracy, human rights and the rule of law as fundamental that they must not be allowed to decay in a strategic partner such as Russia."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the representative of the country holding the presidency said in his speech that at the start of the presidency there was an awakening."
"What did we awake to?"
"We have been aware of the fact of energy dependence for a long time."
"The entire growth in the EU’s energy needs will be covered in the future by increased imports of gas."
"In this connection, we hopefully awoke to the problems of the free passage of energy, which have become evident from the events in Ukraine and Russia."
"What happened before the first cold spell of the year?"
"Before that Ukraine had insisted on switching to market prices for transit facilities."
"That suited Russia, as long as Russia would receive market prices for the gas and not just for transit."
"It consequently emerged that Ukraine had been stealing gas from the reserves stored in Ukraine by the Russian organisation Gazprom."
"At the start of the year it became evident that Ukraine was stealing gas from stocks bound for Europe to supply its own needs."
"In this connection, then, we hopefully awoke to the fact that these problems of transit are serious and stability is also needed in transit countries, and not just in Russia, when it comes to gas supplies."
"Deliveries of gas are obviously made more reliable by the Baltic Sea gas pipeline, which is understandable in that it obviates the need for transit countries that can turn off the taps and steal gas from the pipe."
"With regard to Mr Rehn’s speech, I would say that the Northern Dimension would be worth involving in the EU’s future problems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is interested in developing good relations with Russia, and there are some areas where this has already been successfully achieved."
"This was demonstrated by some of the results of the May summit."
"One example of successful cooperation is the conclusion of the Readmission Agreement."
"The situation prevailing until now, where illegal immigrants from Russia could not be returned to that country, was unacceptable."
"The European Union should also facilitate the conclusion of an appropriate Readmission Agreement between Russia and Ukraine, otherwise illegal immigrants from Russia who enter the European Union through this country will be returned to and remain in Ukraine."
"The establishment of good relations is a two-way process."
"It is paradoxical that the European Union and Russia have at this time concluded the Agreement on visa facilitation."
"As we all know, visas are documents that grant the right to cross national borders; however, Russia refuses to conclude agreements on borders with Latvia and Estonia, and therefore also with the European Union."
"In order to continue to establish constructive relations, Russia must sign and ratify these agreements with Latvia and Estonia, without any pressure on the legally elected parliaments and governments of these Member States."
"The Agreement on visa facilitation between the European Union and Russia cannot come into force until Russia concludes agreements on borders with all Member States of the European Union."
"With regard to visas, it is also important to ensure that the residents of the European Union’s frontier regions are granted relief arrangements for entering Russia."
"This would facilitate both the economic development of these regions and contacts between people."
"It is very much appreciated that energy security issues of general interest were solved during the summit."
"Nevertheless, we hope that in the future greater attention will also be paid to the restriction of democratic freedom and human rights in Russia, where over the last few years there has been noticeable regression in the freedom of the mass media, in the activities of non-governmental organisations and in other fields."
"The strengthening of democracy in Russia is in the interest of the European Union, but most of all in the interest of Russia itself."
"Mr President, since May 2004, the European Union and Russia have found common ground in their relationship with each other."
"Last night, I read in a column by a Dutch analyst, who also happens to be a Russian expert, that according to the Russians, most of these areas or areas of cooperation can, by and large, be described as voids."
"This self-mockery is something the European institutions should take very seriously."
"After all, big joint pronouncements are of more use to Moscow than Brussels at the moment."
"A pragmatic approach to address real common problems has more chance of success."
"Access to Kaliningrad or visa arrangements bear witness to this."
"I would urge you, though, not to think twice about abandoning the illusion of a common neighbourhood policy with the Kremlin."
"Take Belarus, for example, where the idea of a common approach is simply absurd."
"I had to do a double-take when I saw that in a motion for a resolution."
"I have two concrete pragmatic questions for the Commission and Council."
"Has the security of the gas supply from Russia to European customers now been laid down in law and been made transparent?"
"Secondly, as the Austrian Presidency already touched upon this, what is the latest on the final border regulation between the Russian Federation and the two EU Member States Estonia and Latvia?"
"In the final analysis, this is about one of the Union’s common external borders."
"Positive responses to those two questions would certainly show the relationship with Russia in a more appealing light."
"Mr President, the 17th EU-Russia summit took place in Sochi on 25 May."
"The most important event was the signing of the agreement, which had been on the cards for a few months, on readmission and on simplifying visa procedures for European Union and Russian Federation citizens."
"No other documents were signed."
"Neither was any joint statement made."
"The summit in Sochi showed that the list of differences between Russia and the European Union grows ever longer."
"Controversial issues include policies on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, the situation in Russia itself, especially with regard to respect for human rights, and above all energy policy."
"It is becoming increasingly difficult to find areas where definite agreements which produce tangible results can be negotiated."
"At the same time, however, both sides are clearly trying to present their cooperation as friendly and constructive."
"They therefore avoid sensitive subjects in public and instead play up, sometimes out of proportion to their actual importance, the fields where agreements have been reached."
"I think this is the right direction to follow and I hope it is one that will allow us to avoid mistakes such as those made by Poland in its dealings with our Eastern neighbour."
"– Mr President, the last high-level meeting between the EU and Russia revealed certain aspects of EU-Russian relations, which were obvious before, but which had not been discussed openly."
"On Thursday, the European Parliament will vote on a resolution, in which it will indicate in its assessment of the results of the last high-level meeting between the EU and Russia that (and I quote), ‘the current EU partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic as common economic interests have taken first place, while it is not possible to achieve fundamental changes in the areas of human rights and the rule of law’."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is a qualitatively new evaluation as until now it was asserted that Russia and the EU are strategic partners, whose partnership is based on common values, respect for human rights and freedoms, democratic principles, etc. Until now almost all resolutions, which I have had an opportunity to vote on in this Parliament, were based on this very viewpoint – strategic partnership."
"On the other hand, it was obvious that these statements would remain as simply declarations, the hopes of the EU as post-Yeltsin Russia can hardly boast of victories in the areas of human rights or press freedom, rather the contrary."
"I believe that when the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently in force ends and a new agreement is being prepared, these aspects must be taken into account."
"I feel that the EU's priorities should be formulated differently."
"The second aspect, to which I would like to draw your attention, is the dialogue with Russia in the area of energy."
"Unfortunately, at the Sochi summit, which devoted a lot of time to energy, a breakthrough failed to materialise, and Russian representatives continue to maintain that they act according to market economy principles."
"Only Russia somehow applies those principles above all as a punishment for the pro-Western, pro-European orientation of some neighbouring states."
"Meanwhile, the EU's proposals for Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, proposals on transparency and the participation of EU companies in the management of Russian energy sector companies continue to remain a problem for which we must find a solution."
"Mr President, the hottest topic in EU-Russia relations at the moment is energy."
"Energy is a barometer of EU and Russian policy and the EU and Russian economies."
"Energy is also a possible cause of conflict between the European Union and Russia."
"Power cuts and interruptions in the flow of gas and oil immediately result in internal crises in many Member States."
"The interruptions in January left Europe in a partial state of emergency."
"What then could be done about this?"
"The problem could initially be solved with supply contracts."
"Russia wants long-term supply contracts so that it can focus on investing in equipment to guarantee its own energy supply."
"Many in the Union believe that long-term contracts harm competition."
"In this situation, however, in which there is always a shortage of energy, long-term contracts are hardly the biggest problem; rather, they could offer both parties a common goal."
"Contracts guarantee the position of both buyer and seller, and they create stability in the energy supply."
"At the same time, the Union could have an influence on increased investment in the Russian energy sector, which in turn would have an impact on reliability of operations."
"The aim is obviously at some stage to open up the two energy markets to competition, both the Union’s and Russia’s."
"Action could be taken during the Finnish Presidency, as we in Finland have had a long energy partnership with Russia with very long-term agreements, and there have been no worries about reliability of operations, even though Russia has had a couple of revolutions in the last 15 years."
"All the while, the electric power, the oil and the gas have been arriving in the volumes agreed."
"It therefore makes life easier for both parties and creates predictability, which should be the correct starting point between neighbours."
"Mr President, it is, of course, excellent that we have regular fora and mechanisms to develop and deepen our partnership with Russia."
"However, this type of summit, like the one held in Sochi, is perhaps not the best way of doing things."
"Such summits tend to be excessively hyped up – they produce high levels of expectation but furnish quite meagre results."
"At this particular meeting, for example, there was not that much by way of results."
"On the other hand, it is better that we do make slow progress and attempt to achieve quality in the relations that we do have."
"We do, of course, have a lot in common with Russia: trade, the environment and energy."
"This is clear, now of all times, in connection with the scandalous and disgraceful blackmail on Russia’s part using its control of energy as a negotiating tool."
"As regards the fight against terrorism, organised crime and a number of conflicts, there is a need for increased cooperation between Russia and Europe."
"It is gratifying that Russia is on the same side as the USA and ourselves in respect of the negotiations with Iran, but it is less pleasing that Russia is playing solo when it comes to Belarus, Hamas and other matters."
"As many of my fellow Members have already pointed out, we must be extremely clear when it comes to any evaluations we make of our relations with Russia."
"The trend that we have witnessed in recent times in terms of human rights and democracy is very worrying."
"Things are moving backwards, not forwards."
"Foreign Minister Lavrov visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs a month ago."
"He said that Europe and the European Parliament have a very emotional view of human rights."
"He expressed the opinion that we are a little too fixated and that we focused only on this issue."
"In my view, his comments were an excellent compliment, but they were not meant as one."
"It is incredibly important that we are clear when we bring up the situation of voluntary organisations, the increasingly dwindling freedom of the media and the concentration of power in the hands of Mr Putin."
"All this is very serious indeed, and it must be pointed out constantly."
"In our resolution on Russia, which we voted on almost exactly one year ago, we highlighted the need for a very clear, well thought-out and values-based strategy towards Russia."
"Unfortunately, the hope that we expressed at that juncture is still just hope today."
"Mr President, it is self-evident that the relationship between the European Union and the Russian Federation is of huge importance."
"Attention was drawn a moment ago to the energy aspects, to the need for further democratisation in Russia and also to the aspects of international politics."
"We have also noticed that the European Union, Russia and the United States increasingly join forces on the international stage."
"Even following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is still a major world player."
"That also applies at regional level, but we notice that there is still considerable tension between Russia on the one hand and, on the other, the states that have freed themselves from the shackles of the Soviet Union."
"As examples of this, I would cite the continued difficult relationship with the Baltic Sea countries, or the situation in Chechnya, and there have also been the interventions in Ukraine that were designed to nip the Orange Revolution in the bud."
"Democracy in Russia itself is precarious to say the least; one need only look at the problems that NGOs are experiencing."
"In the dialogue between the European Union and Russia, we should therefore constantly draw attention to the need for better compliance with human rights, transparency in energy policy, the fight against corruption and the need for less centralism in general."
"Another problem that deserves much more attention is that of the decommissioned nuclear power stations, which are under hardly any surveillance these days, and from which terrorist groups could well derive benefit."
"That is a point that should always be on the agenda when we talk about relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Mr President, Russia remains, geographically of course, the largest country in the world and enjoys a strategic partnership with the EU through the ‘four common spaces’."
"Russia, for all its faults, remains a democracy, albeit an increasingly authoritarian one."
"It still enjoys vigorous debate in its many media outlets, even if the control by the Kremlin through self-censorship is becoming more apparent in recent years."
"The judiciary, like in many former Soviet countries, still lacks the degree of independence seen in the EU and tends to bend to political pressure."
"But it is not always so."
"I remain an enormous admirer of the contribution to European culture made by Russia, and believe strongly that we must not destabilise this massive Eurasian country, whose confidence is now on the rise again with the recent massive inflow of petrodollars."
"Undoubtedly, Russia has seen violations of human rights by its military in the north Caucasus."
"But we must also recognise the threat posed by Chechen militant Islamic groups eager to capture Muslim population in Russia, which now accounts for around 17% of the population and is rising rapidly."
"Al-Qa’ida is eager to put down roots in the region."
"Clearly also Gazprom the ‘gas weapon’ – used as an extended arm of Russian foreign policy – always seems to upset my friend, and understandably so, particularly in Ukraine, Moldova and the Caucasus."
"Russia must be seen as a reliable energy trading partner and not as a trade bully towards its neighbours and those countries nearby, as we saw recently over the ban against Georgia and Moldova in the importation of their wines and mineral waters, or, even more bizarrely, on the ‘bilateral issue’ with Polish farm products, which I always thought was the Commission’s prerogative, covered by the monopoly on external trade."
"I would also call on Russia now to follow Ukraine’s lead in allowing visa-free travel to all EU citizens in order to boost tourism and facilitate a better public knowledge of this giant eastern neighbour of ours."
"Lastly, I call on Russia to support the EU and the US in preventing nuclear proliferation by Iran."
"– Mr President, according to the President-in-Office of the Council, President Putin has said that the possibility of the energy charter being ratified cannot be excluded in the long term; what that means to me is that it is not going to happen, and that, in fact, was also what the Russian foreign minister told the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Russian ambassador has just said the same thing to us when we discussed energy with him."
"If that is indeed the case, then we must, of course – for is there any alternative? – accept that we will have to shape the relationship established by the treaty between Russia and the EU accordingly, insisting, for a start, on symmetry in the opening-up of the markets."
"It is the very opposite of clear why we should open up our markets while the other party does not."
"We are not, in fact, opening them up completely, so both sides probably need to do more as regards more joint projects, not only for the extraction of crude oil and natural gas, but also as regards putting in place the routes whereby they are to be transported, in the shape of pipelines and so on."
"Secondly, we can be sure that Russia also raised the subject of nuclear technologies and of the trade in them; this is another area where an agreement will probably be needed in order to sort matters out."
"Thirdly, we must of course tell the Russians that we want to diversify, and it is quite clear that we also have to tell them that we want to build other new pipelines in order to make ourselves less dependent, to choose who to depend on, and to create alternatives."
"I believe that energy policy is certainly one area in which we have to say, loud and clear, ‘yes’ to cooperation with Russia, but ‘no’ to dependence on it."
"Mr President, I just wish to address the issue of human rights."
"I see that note was taken of the human rights consultations at the summit on 25 May 2006."
"On 27 May 2006 I had the dubious pleasure of being present at the event organised by Gay Pride, which has been banned, and saw with my own eyes how the Russians feel about freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and protection of the human rights of gay people."
"Frankly, I am not impressed and I would call on our EU leaders to show much stronger leadership when it comes to human rights."
"I have specific questions for the Commissioner."
"Did you raise the issue of the Gay Pride march with Mr Putin two days before the event, when it was already known there would be problems?"
"Did you put pressure on the Russians?"
"Why was the issue not raised at the meeting between President Barroso, Mr Schüssel and religious leaders two days later?"
"Will you raise the issue at the next opportunity, which I believe is the G8 meeting?"
"Will you reply to the chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who responded to the events in Moscow by saying that rather than reminding the Russians that human rights are universal we should not impose our western, liberal values on Russia?"
"In fact, we should be promoting human rights in all our external relations."
"I should like to hear how you intend to do that, Commissioner."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"We should welcome the progress made at the latest EU-Russia summit and the willingness shown by both sides to talk."
"It is important to strictly maintain that line during the negotiations on the future partnership agreement."
"While energy policy is a priority for Europe, it is equally vital that we be careful to ensure that a fully democratic space is created, based on respect for human rights and for ethnic and religious minorities."
"Effective cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the many other conflicts still smouldering on our borders, in the southern Caucasus in particular, cannot in fact work without a basis of common, shared values."
"We therefore call on Russia to become more open in that regard."
"On more than one occasion, the European Union has expressly called for greater synergy in promoting transparency in the exercise of authority and in combating civil and human rights abuses, particularly in difficult regions such as Chechnya, which today still complains of insufficient access to international aid and inadequate development in the region."
"Madam President, I think the essence of today’s debate is that our approach to Russia has been too pragmatic."
"As we observe a clear trend away from civil society and democratic freedoms, it is of paramount importance to strike a convincing balance between economic and strategic interests as the core values on which our partnership with Russia are officially based."
"The resolution drafted by the European Parliament points to several key issues which need to be resolved: the problem of Transnistria, the conflict in the Caucasus, and the need to achieve progress on three other common spaces, besides a common economic space."
"We welcome the Commission’s assistance for recovery in the Northern Caucasus."
"However, it is important to make sure that this assistance has really been reaching the people in need."
"I think it is the view of this Parliament that the human rights dialogue should have the status of a central element of partnership in the future."
"It is not enough to raise human rights issues while still believing or pretending to believe that, in spite of all the alarming facts, Russia is continuing on its way to democracy, Russia is fulfilling its commitments to the Council of Europe signed ten years ago, demonstrating real progress in building a rule of law society and implementing the verdicts of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights – verdicts which the Russian Government has so far ignored."
"That should be a precondition for a new PCA, which will be signed next year."
"Commissioner Rehn has raised the question of interdependence."
"I fully agree, but we are not more dependent on Russian gas than Russia will be dependent on the revenues it receives from its gas."
"– Madam President, international and regional developments confirm the need to formulate new integrated strategic relations between the European Union and Russia."
"No one disputes that the conventional framework of relations dates back to 1994 and cannot respond to the new geo-strategic and geo-economic circumstances."
"From this point of view, the European Union and the European Commission in particular must take specific initiatives, so that we do not wait for the 1994 agreement to expire in December 2007, but take initiatives from today in the direction of strengthening strategic relations with Russia."
"Madam President, the European Union needs its own independent strategy towards Russia."
"On the basis of this assumption, it must repel any attempt to create conditions for a new cold war of confrontation, as being sought by certain powers in the US Administration."
"The recent statements by the US Vice-President Nick Cheney may serve the interests of the United States, but they should have no bearing on the interests of the European Union and its Member States."
"From this point of view, the construction of relations of mutual trust and mutual dependence between the two European strategic partners is a and will also help the new Central and Eastern European countries to overcome the fear and insecurity of the historic past."
"– Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to describe Russia as an important and significant partner is not merely formulaic, for it currently holds the presidency of the Council of Europe and of the G8, and it is also very much in our own interest that we should develop a strategic partnership with it commensurate with its own mass and of the energy and other raw materials that it possesses, not to mention its geographical position."
"Even though Russia is no longer the Soviet Union, so it is not without its problems as regards the process of transformation and some models of conduct."
"We do see, though, just how important Russia can be where Iran is concerned, where the prospect of having it in the same boat with us and being able to drag Iran to the table for negotiations that might well prevent it from building an atom bomb is a powerful argument in favour of maintaining good relations with such a country."
"I believe that that summit also affords us a good opportunity to make headway on the issues of visa relaxations and the arrangements for the return of immigrants, and will enable further progress to be achieved over the coming year as regards the partnership and cooperation agreement, which is needed in order to put our partnership on a firm footing, to develop the four-area-strategy, and achieve results in energy security in particular, for Russia too must know that the partnership is possible only if it recognises not only the freedom of all nations in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond, but also that they may not be allowed to become victims on other grounds."
"We do, of course, regard what is going on within Russia – where the freedom of the press is concerned, for example – with some concern; is it well-advised to go back to having such a concentration of big businesses in state ownership, even though the present high energy prices mean that they are currently bringing in plenty of money?"
"Can that result in self-sustaining economic development?"
"I have my doubts, just as I do when it comes to human rights – another issue that has to be addressed."
"There are critical questions, but we should resolve them through dialogue, and thus be in a position to breathe life into this partnership."
"Madam President, those who are familiar with Russian politics and style are well aware of the fact that we can achieve more results using a more realistic, pragmatic policy that is more ready to compromise, than by exerting pressure."
"Hungary has managed to achieve a complete turnaround in this respect over the past four years, with mutual apologies and concrete, pragmatic steps."
"Russia was wrong to penalise Ukraine by shutting off gas taps, even though Western European consumers were not affected."
"It is important that Russia does not employ such double-edged measures in the future, and the European Union should not allow itself to become hysterical."
"The fear that the Russians may obtain too large a share in the final phase of the European Union energy sector is exaggerated, because at this moment their share does not even reach 10%."
"Joint venture companies in Germany are working extremely well."
"It is not sufficient to hold Russia back, to persuade it not to exert pressure by withholding energy supplies or by restricting imports of Moldavian and Georgian wine and Polish meat; the European Union must help by acting as a mediator, to ensure that Russia’s neighbours take into account the geopolitical realities and the geographical closeness of Russia."
"."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see that time has almost caught up with us, but I can keep it brief."
"I am in fact in the very fortunate position of being able to say, at the end of this very interesting debate, that, although I do not of course agree with everything that has been said, I do agree with a very great deal of it, and that is very much the position of the Council too."
"I am grateful to Mr Eurlings and Mr Wiersma, and Mr Brok, too, said many things that struck me as quite essential and important, particularly in relation to the issue of partnership in international affairs."
"Reference was made to the issue of Iran, and it is also important that we should recall, as Mr Kelam and Mr Andrejevs reminded us, the self-evident fact that Russia must discharge its obligations to the Council of Europe, the presidency of which it holds."
"We are all familiar with the Ilaşcu case, and expect further progress to be made on it in the Council of Europe, particularly while Russia holds the presidency."
"I can do no other than agree with the last speaker when he says that what is needed in the final analysis is a pragmatic approach characterised by partnership, but one that does not involve us abandoning our principles."
"It goes without saying that human rights issues have to be addressed and must be addressed in plain language, but this must be done with one end in view; not that of bringing about a breakdown in relations, but that of achieving something definite and positive in terms of a better mutual understanding of what human rights are."
"That is what the Council is working towards; that is what the Commission is aiming for."
"I am glad to be able to say, at the end of this debate, that it is also an objective that your House shares, and so I do believe that, if we work together, we will, not least to our own benefit, be able to make this partnership with Russia into something very positive."
"."
"Madam President, thank you for a very serious and substantive debate."
"I fully agree with Mr Winkler in that regard."
"Mr Eurlings and various Members pointed out that we must not trade human rights for energy;"
"I fully agree."
"We want both human rights and energy."
"How can we do that?"
"We need principles, pragmatism and partnership."
"Let me point out that in the field of human rights we have established a set of formal consultations and we have had three meetings since the launch of these consultations in 2005."
"By way of example, the latest meeting focused on four issues: firstly, on the Russian law on non-governmental organizations; secondly, human rights in the military; thirdly, issues relating to the north Caucasus; and fourthly, racism and xenophobia."
"We also held a preparatory meeting with human rights non-governmental organisations, which we deemed particularly useful."
"I want to inform you that we will be holding the next meeting of these consultations in November in Moscow and will be pursuing the idea of closer involvement of NGOs."
"We want to make these consultations more results-oriented in the future."
"I can assure you that the Commission will keep human rights at centre-stage in our relations with Russia, not least as we are talking about the country which currently holds the Presidency of the Council of Europe."
"On energy, Mr Kelam referred to the interdependence between the EU and Russia."
"We can also say that we not only have interdependence but also import dependence, since by 2020 the EU will have to import around 70% of the gas it consumes."
"According to current forecasts, Russian production and export capacity will fall short of EU needs unless massive investment takes place in Russia."
"We are therefore working to ensure that sufficient additional quantities of gas can come into the EU and we will have to look at all possible sources and routes, including Turkey, incidentally."
"This requires strengthened cooperation and increased imports from Russia, as well as from other countries."
"At the same time, let us keep the big picture in mind."
"One of Europe’s greatest challenges will be to reduce dependence on energy imports and on fossil fuels."
"Therefore, it is very important that our energy policy and the external aspects of Europe’s common energy policy are very high on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency and, I trust, of all the future presidencies."
"Reference was made to Gazprom and its ambitions to purchase EU assets."
"In this regard the main concern within the EU is the apparent lack of a level playing field."
"EU companies which may invest in upstream assets in Russia do not have the right to independently access the Russian gas transportation infrastructure."
"Within the EU, the right to access gas transportation infrastructure is enshrined in EU legislation."
"In this context, the rules applicable to Gazprom, notably EU competition rules, would be no different to those applied to any other company."
"The fact that Gazprom is the exclusive supplier of gas from Russia to the EU would have to be taken into account in any objective analysis."
"Reference was also made to free trade and the PCA."
"I want to finish with this, because this is a very important strategic issue in EU-Russia relations."
"The objective of a free trade agreement was already included in the PCA when it was concluded in 1994."
"For a free trade agreement, Russian accession to the WTO is a prerequisite."
"In this regard, it is important to note that the WTO accession process is now coming to its final phase and we expect that this condition will soon be met by Russia."
"Reference to a free trade agreement was made at the Sochi Summit for further exploration."
"Our point of departure is that trade and economic integration will be core elements for the post-PCA agreement and our intention is to set up a broader and deeper free trade agreement, some kind of ‘FTA-plus’ achieving deeper free trade than normal, simple free trade agreements."
"Let me conclude now, because I know that many colleagues have more important things to do."
"Six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate have been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"I see that Mrs in’t Veld has a point of order."
"To which of the Rules of Procedure do you wish to refer?"
"Madam President, there was not sufficient time for both gentlemen to reply to my very precise questions and I would like them to provide this House with a written reply if possible."
"What we will do, then, is forward your question and request in the hope that you will then get an answer to them."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0224/2006)."
"We will take the following questions to the Commission."
"The EBRD is in the process of funding the project Sakhalin II devised by Sakhalin Energy, whose main shareholder is the company Shell."
"There are many areas where there is no scientific certainty regarding the impact of Sakhalin Energy's Sakhalin II project, for example the impact on wildlife from excessively noisy offshore geological surveys or constructions."
"However, the company will not take the precautionary approach and delay its operations."
"Given that the best science is not being applied by Shell, and recommendations are being ignored, how does the project comply with the EBRD's policy in support of the precautionary principle?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environmental policy of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which was approved in April 2003, is aimed at ensuring that the projects funded by the Bank respect the environment and the applicable legislative requirements."
"To this end, the EBRD reserves the right to reject any project presented to the Board of Directors if it believes that it does not conform to that policy."
"It is a publicly recognised fact – as you know – that the EBRD’s policy with regard to environmental standards and the precautionary principle is extremely rigorous."
"Since 2002, the EBRD has been paying particular attention to Sakhalin 2, in close cooperation with the company Sakhalin Energy, in order to assess all of the aspects of the project, in particular its environmental and social impact, and to draw up the appropriate monitoring and attenuation measures in accordance with the Bank’s environmental policy."
"Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that there have been, and still are, significant causes for concern in relation to the Sakhalin 2 project, particularly in terms of the protection of the population of western grey whales living in the area."
"The Bank has responded to that concern by contributing to the creation of a group of recognised scientists, with the participation of representatives of non-governmental organisations, in order to monitor the situation of the whales and to propose measures to reduce the possible negative impact of the project."
"The company has applied these measures, and the latest comments from the group have largely been positive."
"With regard to another difficult issue, the river crossing, the Bank has also been firm, calling for improvements to the company’s actions and, in particular, the drawing up of a river crossing strategy that imposes restrictions and ensures that there will be no net loss of salmon spawning areas."
"In short, the EBRD has put considerable pressure on Sakhalin Energy to improve the environmental quality of the project."
"We will soon have new data on the assessments and public consultations under way that will allow the European Commission's representative in the EBRD to take a position on the project's conformity to the Bank's environmental policy."
"Madam President, if I understand the Commissioner correctly, he is defending continued expenditure on Sakhalin II, despite the fact that it fails to meet most of the bank’s own criteria."
"The first criterion is that funding is only supposed to be given to projects that cannot otherwise be funded in a simple way."
"Shell, the owner of the company in question, last year recorded earnings of USD 23 billion. They have enough money to find the cash they need somewhere."
"The EBRD states that sustainable development is the highest priority. Yet, if this is so, what we have here is a case of building first and worrying about monitoring things afterwards."
"No heed was paid to the advice provided by the group of experts you mention until it was too late."
"No measures at all were taken in respect of the environmental problems;"
"I have a long list of environmental problems that were not dealt with. Nor was the ‘stakeholder dialogue’ implemented as set out in the programmes."
"Seventeen organisations were against what was proposed."
"That is a monologue, not a dialogue."
"."
"Madam President, Mr Schlyter, I have not said that the Bank has decided to fund it."
"I have said that the Bank is analysing the conclusions of the groups of experts which are to give their opinion on whether or not the situation corresponds to the criteria of the Bank's environmental policy."
"If the Bank is involved in the overall funding of the project, even if its contribution represents a small percentage, the Bank, as a result of a series of circumstances which I do not have time to explain, has a great capacity to apply pressure on the company to improve the environmental and social conditions of the project."
"If the company cannot ultimately conform to these conditions, however, the representative of the European Commission will act accordingly, and I am confident that the Bank will also do so, applying the criteria of its environmental policy which, as I said at the beginning, are generally acknowledged to be rigorous and transparent, since everybody has been aware of them since their approval in 2003."
"Commissioner, what about the indigenous peoples?"
"On paper, they were taken into consideration, but when it comes to discussing matters with them, their rights are seemingly not taken into account."
"Can you say a word or two about this in the context of this project?"
"."
"Madam President, Mrs Isler Béguin, I am also aware of the situation affecting the indigenous people of the area."
"Amongst other issues, the Secretary-General of the Bank, Mr Reichenbach, analysed and considered this situation on his visit to the area in January."
"I also believed that the question related exclusively to environmental aspects, but the social aspects and the impact on the population – which, on the one hand, is positive because employment is being created, but, on the other, may have consequences that are undoubtedly worrying – is of course being considered by the Bank."
"The question your colleague put to me related strictly to environmental conditions, and those are what I referred to in my first reply, but I can assure you that the Commission's representative in the Bank, Mr Lelakis, is perfectly aware of, and is monitoring the impact of, the project on the situation of the indigenous people of the area."
"Given the still unresolved issues surrounding the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (software patents), the question arises what the Commission will do next."
"What future measures does the Commission propose to take in this area?"
"Is it true that, in spite of the European Parliament’s clear rejection on 6 July 2005, the Commission is still seeking a solution in line with the rejected common position?"
". In its vote of 6 July 2005, Parliament rejected the Council common position on the directive on computer-implemented inventions, which implies rejection of the proposed directive."
"As a result, there are no Community legal texts which will regulate this issue."
"The vote and the far-reaching debate which preceded it demonstrated that the time was not ripe for a meaningful piece of legislation to be adopted on this issue."
"Therefore, a new proposal dealing specifically with the patentability of computer-implemented inventions would not be desirable."
"As a consequence, the legal framework applicable to computer-implemented inventions in Europe remains Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, which excludes computer programs as such from patentability."
"Earlier this year, the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Internal Market and Services launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on the future patent policy in Europe, with a particular focus on the structure of the European patent system."
"The deadline for the consultation was 12 April 2006, and preliminary findings will be discussed with stakeholders at the hearing in Brussels on 12 July 2006."
"Consultation is intended to ensure that any further possible action in the area of EU patents policy takes account of all stakeholders’ needs without discrimination."
"Parliament will be duly informed of the results of this consultation."
"One of the options presented to stakeholders refers to the Commission’s proposal for Community patent regulation."
"The Commission would like to point out that its possible adoption will not alter the substantive rules governing patentability which are set out in the EPC and would not extend patentability to software as such."
"Moreover, the new jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would improve the safeguards against the grant of patents in error to a computer program."
"Therefore, the Commission does not intend to present a new proposal along the lines of the rejected common position on CII."
"– Madam President, the Commissioner’s answer was brief, but comprehensible and clear, and for that I am obliged to him."
"I am very positively struck by the breadth of his concept of information collection and also of transparency."
"There is another matter, Commissioner, concerning which I would like further information from you."
"You said that this House would be kept informed."
"I believe that it should also be involved in this decision-making process, and for that reason I should like to know how you think it might be."
". The European Parliament will also participate in this consultation."
"As I said in my reply, we asked for a consultation on the whole area of patents policy."
"The closing date for submissions was 12 April 2006."
"There will be a hearing in Brussels on 12 July 2006."
"That will be a consultation about the whole area of patent policy and does not specifically refer to computer-implemented inventions."
"I said in the debate leading up to the European Parliament vote that if the European Parliament were to reject the proposal at that stage I would not bring forward a further proposal in the area, so I shall not be bringing forward a further proposal."
"I am very pleased to hear that, Commissioner."
"We made our position clear last year when we blocked the common position, which would have codified the EPO’s disputable software patent practice."
"That was the right decision, and your decision not to table a new proposal is also the right one."
"I should like to ask a question regarding the more general work regarding patent policy."
"We now have a lot of proposals on the table, such as the Community patent, a European patent litigation agreement and maybe even some suggestions for finally changing the EPC."
"What do you think the procedure should be for this?"
"Should Parliament have codecision?"
". As the honourable Member is aware, the proposal on the Community patent has been stuck at a certain stage and we have been unable to make progress."
"Therefore, at the end of last year I thought that, rather than waiting for things to evolve, it was important to have a general consultation as to how stakeholders felt we should move forward."
"As I have said at committee meetings, it is still my intention to give the Community patent one last try during my term of office."
"I will decide when I think is the best time to get that done and give it my best efforts at that time."
"I thought it was not good to leave things in abeyance and that it would be better to have this consultation about general patent policy, and that is what these consultations are about."
"The question the honourable Member asked regarding codecision is a matter for the Treaties."
"However, I personally favour codecision."
"Please, Commissioner, when we discuss this in the future, can we make sure that the small enterprises are more involved than the first time around."
"One of the reasons it was rejected was that many small developers felt threatened by this legislation and the big lobby organisations followed the big companies’ lines, which in most cases are contrary to the good healthy development of alternatives because they will be strangled by the patents of the big companies."
"So please make sure they have their voices heard from the beginning next time."
"If not, the next issue will be blocked the second time round."
"The Commission did in fact consult SMEs on the last occasion, but I will pass on your remarks to the next Commissioner."
"As I have repeatedly said, I will not be going into this area in my time as Commissioner."
"However, I will gladly leave it on file and it will be available for the next Commissioner who takes over this responsibility."
"In Belgium the company Serverscheck has instituted legal proceedings against Google."
"When the name Serverscheck is entered into the Google toolbar, the programme suggests following a link to an illegal pirated version of Serverscheck’s products."
"The company wants Google to filter this suggestion."
"Google said that it could not take any account of an unregistered brand name."
"Serverscheck is a trade name, which, according to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property – signed by the 25 EU Member States – should guarantee the same level of protection."
"What is the Commission’s stance on this case in which a company is not prepared to filter certain information that is harmful to both consumers and businesses, thus flouting a Convention that the 25 EU Member States have signed?"
"Is Google abusing its monopoly by refusing to cooperate in this case and failing to take account of European legal regulations?"
". In response to the honourable Member’s question on an alleged infringement of industrial property rights, the Commission stresses that it cannot intervene in a legal dispute between private parties pending before the court of a Member State."
"If a party believes that its industrial property rights have been infringed and sues in a national court, it is for the national judge to ascertain whether an infringement has taken place."
"It is also for the national judge to consider whether the relevant national legislation is in line with European Community law and with international treaties to which the relevant country is a party."
"European Community law governing the enforcement of intellectual property rights applies to trade names only insofar as these are protected as exclusive property rights in the national law concerned."
"In any event, the European Community is not a contracting party to the Paris Convention on the Protection of Industrial Property."
"The honourable Member should also note that Article 15.1 of the Electronic Commerce Directive prohibits the application of a general filtering obligation to Internet hosting services."
"According to Article 14.3 of that directive, it is only a court or an administrative authority that can require a given service provider to terminate or prevent a specific infringing activity."
"In addition, the Commission does not consider that the points raised by the honourable Member relate to the market power or the potential monopoly that the company in question may have."
"Commissioner, thank you for your response."
"I still think that there is an important European dimension to this issue."
"You know as well as I do that research has shown that the average consumer uses search engines to find the right websites, much more than by directly inputting addresses, because it is easier, but also because the consumer has faith in those search engines."
"It now transpires that this faith is not always justified, and it worries me that private firms are not, apparently, required to adhere to the rules."
"I therefore think that the Commission should take steps in order to ensure that consumers and enterprises, including small enterprises, can make use of those services in a safe manner."
"Of course I hope that small companies, and every other company, can use these services safely."
"However, the question put to me related to the Commission’s role in this matter."
"As I pointed out in my reply, this is in fact a matter for a national court, and is not a matter for the European Commission."
"That is the situation under existing law."
"According to a Commission press release (12 April 2006) concerning competition in the payment cards industry, there are large price differentials on the internal market."
"Consumers pay as much as 100% more in bank charges for using MasterCard and Visa in some Member States."
"Furthermore, throughout the European Union, the charges paid by businesses differ by as much as 500% for Visa and 650% for MasterCard."
"In view of card users' complaints about the lack of transparency and high charges associated with their transactions, can the Commission say whether it is looking into the matter?"
"Does it intend to propose any measures?"
"Can the Commission provide a comparison of the situation on the market in Greece and that in the other Member States on the basis of the data available to it?"
"On 12 April 2006 we published a preliminary report on the findings of the inquiry into competition conditions in the payment card sector in the EU."
"That report confirms that businesses and consumers do not yet benefit from a fully competitive internal market in payment cards."
"The large price differentials which exist within the single market are a clear sign of this."
"In the Commission’s view these price differentials, and the high levels of fees that are currently charged, indicate that there is scope for significantly reducing prices at least in some Member States."
"The Commission is now holding a public consultation on the interim report."
"We will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties, including the industry and consumers before we draw any conclusions on the way forward."
"If the preliminary findings on payment cards are borne out by this consultation, the Commission will consider action under EC Treaty anti-trust rules in individual cases."
"However, the Commission would also like to emphasise that it is important that market participants themselves help to tackle the problems identified in the inquiry."
"So it is now also up to them."
"There is a considerable lack of transparency in the current market."
"The preliminary result of the enquiry into the sector provides all stakeholders with substantial information on how the market functions, and the Commission sincerely hopes that this will help players in the industry to correct some of the problems themselves."
"The more the payment card industry does on its own initiative, the less it is likely to face action under anti-trust rules and, as we are aware, prevention is better than cure."
"The honourable Member refers in particular to the situation in Greece compared with other Member States."
"The inquiry indeed found that the fees charged to consumers and businesses in Greece are above the EU-25 average."
"At present the Commission has deliberately refrained from identifying individual countries or networks or banks as negative examples in this sector."
"The Commission prefers to encourage a generally constructive debate with a view to finding solutions to the problems from among stakeholders and from within the industry itself."
"The Commission will keep Parliament informed of the conclusions it draws, following the public consultation, and of any further action it considers appropriate in the light of those conclusions."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for the reply, although I note that you couched it in much more general terms in replying to the European Parliament than in the preliminary conclusion released on 12 April."
"I should like to ask you when the Commission intends to table and present specific measures."
"When will the study be finished and can you give us some figures for Greece or are they confidential?"
". In answer to your last question: no, not at this time."
"I have explained that, following the result of the preliminary findings, we shall be contacting those involved during the consultation procedure."
"Hopefully, they have already taken into account that there is something rotten in the state in certain circumstances and they will come up with certain decisions or proposals, or whatever, when we have finalised matters after the consultation, which will be before the end of the year."
"Then we will review the situation and either put forward proposals or just inform you that a couple of those that did not behave are reacting positively and correcting their behaviour."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, small and medium-sized businesses pay up to 70% more than large companies for the use of credit cards by their customers."
"This results in higher costs of the final product to European consumers and the creation of inflation, which may reach as much as 2.5%."
"As I have asked the same question as my honourable friend on a previous occasion, I ask you:"
"Does the Commission believe that the financial services sector should be integrated into the systems of the single market and the single euro payment area?"
". The honourable Member is correct when he says that, especially in the SME sector, there is something that you could call ‘paying too much’."
"Businesses, including SMEs, and consumers are paying several billion euros too much every year because banks do not compete enough, and that is one of the problems that we are facing and on which we have to act."
"Let there be no misunderstanding about that."
"Markets are still fragmented and we do not yet have a functioning single market for payments in Europe."
"That is the main purpose of our action: there will be change; there must be change, to be frank about it."
"All players, in particular in the financial industry, must work for this."
"You can be sure that your Commissioner will do her utmost."
"– Madam President, I should be interested to know what the Commission thinks about the problem with credit card charges still being graduated by reference to turnover, as a result of which small and medium-sized enterprises and especially small tourist businesses are put at a particular disadvantage."
"Do you believe that this is justified in terms of competition law?"
". Every time you use a card for payment you bear a cost of up to 2.5%, which is equivalent to a consumption tax."
"If the payment cards business becomes more competitive – and that is what we are pushing for – then every household could save up to several hundred euro per year."
"Competitiveness, competitiveness, competitiveness: that’s it!"
"In accordance with Community law, Poland recently introduced provisions authorising the parallel distribution of pharmaceuticals."
"Contrary to popular opinion, the price of many medicines in Poland is higher than in the 'old' Member States."
"Parallel distribution appears to be a good method of introducing competition in the market for proprietary products."
"Such competition should bring savings for the Polish Government and, at the same time, for the general public."
"It was recently brought to my attention that the opportunities for significant savings offered by parallel distribution in Poland cannot be fully taken advantage of owing to delivery restrictions which pharmaceutical producers have placed on wholesalers in countries with lower pharmaceutical prices."
"This behaviour strikes me as a flagrant breach of Community law."
"The Commission has recently been taking a firm stance in protecting consumer interests and ensuring competition in many sectors, including the automotive sector."
"So why is it being so circumspect about rigorously applying anti-monopoly provisions in the pharmaceuticals sector and protecting the interests of Polish patients?"
"."
"The Commission’s competition enforcement priorities in the pharmaceutical sector have two key objectives: one is to tackle intra-brand competition between the producers of patented prescription products and the parallel importers of those products; the other is to promote competition in innovation for patented medicines between the pharmaceutical producers, which has declined in Europe in the last decade, and to encourage intra-brand competition from generic substitutes after patent expiry."
"That should, in time, contribute to ensuring a wider choice of both patented and generic pharmaceutical products to European patients at affordable prices."
"Due account is taken of the need for the industry to recover its research and development costs, given the industry’s heavy dependence on innovation for its further competitiveness."
"In that context, the honourable Member can be assured that the Commission is not circumspect about rigorously applying the anti-monopoly provisions in the pharmaceutical sector, for generic competition is an area which has suffered from under-enforcement in the past."
"However, the importance of the generic segment for the provision of affordable medicines in the enlarged Union cannot be ignored."
"That is why the Commission will give greater priority to competition in the generic sector in the immediate future."
"On the issue of parallel trade, the Commission has always taken an active approach to combating restrictions on parallel trade in pharmaceuticals."
"In the Commission’s opinion, parallel imports are a legal form of trade between the Member States, constituting an alternative means of supply in the import countries."
"The Commission is aware of the supply quota systems put in place by several pharmaceutical companies."
"Under those systems, pharmaceutical companies unilaterally allocate a quota of medicines to their wholesalers."
"In principle the quota covers domestic demand for the medicines in question in a particular Member State."
"The European courts have held that such unilateral supply quota systems are not within the scope of Article 81 of the EC Treaty when there is not enough evidence that they are the result of an agreement with wholesalers."
"However, another type of practice aimed at curbing parallel trade such as ‘dual pricing systems’ – which, as you know, are systems where prices differ according to whether the product is for local consumption or for export to the other Member States – has been held to infringe Article 81 in, for example, the Glaxo-Wellcome decision of May 2001."
"The Greek national competition authority has initiated proceedings against restrictions on parallel trade on the basis of Article 82, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position."
"There are also parallel civil litigation proceedings pending in Greece, dealing with the same matter."
"The Commission is monitoring these developments closely."
"Article 152 makes clear that the organisation and the delivery of health services and medical care are the responsibility of the Member States."
"The competent national authorities are free to make their own decisions on pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, provided that these decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not create barriers to trade."
"The Commission understands that in Poland the price of reimbursable pharmaceuticals is subject to a Ministry of Health decision following representations from the industry."
"In discharging that duty, the Polish authorities could and do use prices in other EU Member States – including low-price countries – as a reference point."
"It should also be noted that the Commission has recently launched a project under the pharmaceutical forum, which addresses the issue of national pricing and reimbursement practices."
"That project will take account of the interests of patients, Member States, wholesalers, manufacturers and other stakeholders."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the Commissioner for her detailed response."
"It is the first time I have ever received such a specific reply to a question."
"However, I would still like to explain that the situation in Poland is such that we cannot take full advantage of parallel distribution methods because pharmaceutical manufacturers are forcing pharmaceutical wholesalers to ban imports of cheaper medicines and therefore ..."
"The Commission certainly knows that it has traditionally taken a proactive approach and has adopted several decisions under Article 81 prohibiting restrictive agreements between the pharmaceutical companies and the wholesalers aimed at impeding parallel exports."
"Earlier Commission prohibition decisions – for example Johnson [amp] Johnson in 1980 and Sandoz in 1987 – concerned agreed export bans."
"The Sandoz prohibition decision was appealed against in the European Court of Justice, but the Court upheld the decision."
"So we are aware of your point."
"I have a question for the Member of the Commission."
"The situation in Lithuania is similar to that in Poland."
"In our country, pharmaceuticals are often more expensive than in the old European Union Member States."
"For example, there is a paradox that on the other side of the Baltic Sea in Sweden, where living standards are significantly higher, pharmaceuticals are cheaper."
"Therefore, I would like to ask directly if the national governments are guilty that such a situation has come about, or if it is the influence of the European Union's activities, including the work of the European Commission and imperfections in legislation."
". Article 152 makes it clear that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care are the responsibility of Member States, as I mentioned before."
"Competent national authorities are free to make their own decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical articles, provided that these decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not create barriers to trade."
"Member States therefore play a key role, as do the national competition authorities."
"However, they need to be transparent in the decisions they take in that national context."
"Despite the fact that the Commission takes the view that the merger between Suez and Gaz de France complies with the EU mergers regulation, this concentration continues to be a source of great uncertainty in Belgium."
"The merger threatens, after all, seriously to distort competition in the Belgian energy market, given that the new group produced by the merger will control the entire energy market in production, sales and storage."
"Can the Commission say what effects the planned merger between Gaz de France and Suez will have on competition in the Belgian energy market?"
"What steps will the Commission take to protect consumer interests in this market and, in concrete terms, will the Commission require the new merged group to hive off activities in Belgium (production, distribution) in order to safeguard competition?"
". As we are all aware, there are quite a number of issues to be dealt with."
"But first let me first correct one point in the oral question by the honourable Member."
"Contrary to what he is implying in his question, the Commission has not yet formed any opinion on whether the proposed merger between Suez and Gaz de France complies with the EC merger regulation."
"The proposed merger was indeed notified on 10 May 2006 and the Commission will take a decision by 19 June 2006 as to whether or not a thorough second-phase investigation under the EU merger regulation will be necessary."
"This assessment will be based on the wide-ranging market investigation currently under way."
"The honourable Member can rest assured that the Commission is investigating this case very carefully – like all other cases, by the way – in order to assess the impact of this operation on the European energy sector, and in particular in Belgium and in France, where those parties have a very important market position."
"The Commission cannot prejudge the result of the investigation – you would not blame me for that."
"The extent and gravity of any possible competition problems can only be established after the market investigation; but, should this investigation confirm the existence of any competition problems, then the parties would have the opportunity to propose appropriate remedies, and this is in line with the usual practice."
"Finally, the Commission would wish to recall its extensive experience in assessing remedies based on earlier cases, especially in this sector."
"Commissioner, very briefly, I know you want to err on the side of caution and you refer to remedies, but you must realise, of course, that you are the most important guarantor of prices remaining affordable for Belgian consumers and for Belgian enterprises who buy gas and electricity."
"Could you at least confirm on this platform that you intend to intervene, and can you enlarge upon the nature of those remedies?"
"Can you also confirm that you can promise that competition will be guaranteed, that there will not be a monopoly and that the merged company may well be required, depending on the outcome of the inquiry, to divest itself of some of its activities in Belgium?"
". I will not prejudge what could possibly come to light during those inquiries."
"We are in any case acutely aware of the fact that we are talking about an eventual merger that will constitute one of Europe’s largest energy groups."
"This means that, with this conclusion – which a child could draw – we are all too aware of the fact that we will need to exercise extreme caution and that we will need to assess in good faith whether everything is in line with European competition rules."
"You can rest assured that the consumer plays a key role in competition policy, because in the final analysis, the consumer benefits a very great deal from our approach, which involves fair competition and a good positioning of groups within the market."
"At no point does the answer to Question P-1238/06 indicate the specific results of such measures as exchanges of ideas and best practices, visits to Member States and the organisation of conferences, etc., or what solutions they are intended to lead to."
"Particularly in the case of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, it remains unclear what strategy is being pursued in order to establish a partnership and which stakeholders are being invited to participate in the project."
"Can the Commission say whether it is pledging its active support to an initiative which has already reached an advanced stage and which seeks the establishment of a European influenza task force, and can it state what role the Commission will play in this knowledge centre, which is to bring together existing expertise and facilitate structured cooperation among all parties concerned?"
"I am afraid that this is my second interaction today with the honourable Member, Mr Staes, and I have to disappoint him for a second time in one afternoon."
"Even though the idea and the proposal are very interesting and would have been worth exploring in the past, we have already reached a very advanced level of cooperation at various levels within and outside the European Union on avian flu, not only as regards a possible pandemic but also on the animal health side."
"Therefore, we feel that, at this point, it would not offer any added value to have any more coordinating bodies."
"I should like to assure the honourable Member that the tasks this task force would have performed are already at very advanced stages – if not completed – in the European Union."
"That also applies to the WHO, WHO Europe, the G8 and other international organisations."
"We therefore feel that adding another coordinating group could have the negative effect of confusing responsibilities which have already clearly been defined."
"We believe strongly in close collaboration with our different partners and we have already reached an advanced stage there."
"We hold joint meetings of the chief health officers, the chief veterinary officers and all the experts on animal and human health."
"We are also funding various research projects."
"For example, we have launched a major initiative on the development of pandemic influenza vaccines."
"On the availability of research data, the European Centre for Disease Control is already active in making such data available and early-warning networks for outbreaks in humans and animals are already in place."
"The creation very recently of an EU-wide network of media officers is also a major step."
"In the area of seasonal vaccination coverage, I remind health ministers repeatedly of the WHO objectives and the advantage of extending and expanding the coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination in readiness for a possible pandemic."
"In terms of global partnership, the European Union is actively engaged in close collaboration with China and the United States – these are the two international initiatives brought together after the Beijing conference."
"Only last week we had the follow-up meeting in Vienna, in which we discussed practical ways of taking this forward."
"It is true that there was a delay in delivering the funds pledged in Beijing."
"Nevertheless, the decision has now been taken to proceed as quickly as possible."
"It is very appropriate that the next meeting on this issue will take place in Africa, which is a region that has recently been affected."
"Nevertheless, and in conclusion, I should like to say that we are always open to suggestions."
"We do not have any prejudices and are not afraid of sharing views, responsibilities and cooperation."
"We are always open to ideas and suggestions that would improve both the effectiveness of our preparedness measures and collaboration at both EU and international level."
"Commissioner, thank you for your response which is, indeed, somewhat disappointing, especially because it contradicts Mr Adamou's report, which we discussed today, and Article 23 of which specifically asks for a task force such as this, or an influenza working party."
"You claim that this will not add any value, but all scientists I have spoken to during preparations of the Adamou report claim that there is indeed a great deal of expertise, but that it is very widespread and that an influenza working party would certainly add value and would even be more effective than the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which is currently carrying out some of the tasks."
"Could you, then, explain once more why this working party would not add any value?"
"."
"I noted the paragraph in the report we were discussing earlier today, but the fact remains that at this stage we feel that we already have the structures and mechanisms to take advantage of the knowledge, expertise and experience on both animal and human health, which is why adding one more body at this point would not offer any advantages but might, on the contrary, pose problems."
"I assure you that our criterion is purely a practical one and that we evaluate the best way to obtain practical results."
"We have no objection to the idea as such; it is just that we feel this point would not offer any practical advantages."
"Is the Commission aware of the disparities in car hire services throughout Europe, which can leave some holidaymakers in danger of paying out large excesses for unexpected extra charges?"
"Complaints from customers include being under pressure to take out expensive insurance, having to pay bills for damage that they didn't cause, unhelpful service, lack of documentation, and misinformation on basic procedures like dealing with accidents and refuelling."
"Is the Commission considering European action to address the lack of consumer protection in the hire car industry?"
"."
"The Commission is aware of the problems experienced by consumers in connection with car hire and we have legislation that could help to a certain extent."
"One such piece of legislation is the one on unfair terms of consumer contracts."
"It provides relevant protection."
"The implementation of these provisions lies, of course, with the Member States."
"Nevertheless, even these provisions do not offer sufficient protection, especially in relation to difficulties where pressure and unfair business practices generally are involved."
"For example, the honourable Member refers to complaints from consumers who have been under pressure to take out expensive insurance."
"We have new legislation in place."
"As you know, last year we adopted the legislation on unfair commercial practices. This covers pressure selling."
"Its provisions will come into force at the beginning of next year and it regulates aggressive commercial business, both misleading practices and aggressive practices."
"One advantage of this directive is that it has a list of criteria helping to determine whether a commercial practice involves harassment, coercion, including physical force, or undue influence, but also of course misleading representations."
"At the same time, I would like to inform the honourable Member that we are currently in the process of conducting a review of eight of the consumer directives."
"Some of them could be relevant to car hire."
"One which is very important is the one on distance selling."
"Unfortunately, based on a ruling of the Court of Justice, this does not cover car hire."
"Therefore we have included these directives in our review, but will also examine, through consultations, whether it is useful and necessary to amend this directive so as to cover car hire under these provisions, that is, distance selling."
"We are gathering evidence in this respect and are discussing it with stakeholders."
"The outcome of this debate and consultation will determine whether we should amend this directive."
"If this happens, then we will fill one gap in the legal protection of consumers when they rent cars from a distance."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that comprehensive reply."
"If should just add that – as you are probably aware – if you pay by credit card for something in a shop or for a room in a hotel, that information cannot be used retrospectively, with more charges being added on."
"However, this does seem to happen in the car hire industry."
"There are many companies who also charge people for damage that has not occurred or is very minor."
"This is an industry that affects Europeans who are travelling around Europe, so I very much welcome your commitment to look again at the consumer directives, distance selling, unfair aggressive practices, and hope very much that my colleagues and I can work with you, introduce amendments and address the current car hire situation"
"."
"Very briefly, I agree with the honourable Member."
"We are in the process of reviewing the and working on the distance selling directive – which has a problem, admittedly."
"That does not mean that the other two directives do not offer protection to a certain extent, which is why it is important for Parliament and the Commission to raise the issue with the Member States who are in charge and have responsibility for the implementation of Community legislation."
"Would the Commissioner agree with me that the car hire sector is one that should be a prime beneficiary of the Services Directive, and that the provisions of that directive, which we approved to encourage sectors to develop good codes of practice and quality standards, would be an ideal application in this case?"
"Perhaps he could take up the suggestion by my colleague, Robert Evans, with which I associate myself, to call the car hire companies together, present them with some of these disserving consumer reports and suggest that they might set up a Europe-wide set of codes of practice, standards and quality marks that really would benefit the consumer very quickly?"
"I think Mr Harbour is trying to get me into trouble."
"Every time we deal with the services directive it is always a risky business!"
"I shall be very happy to take up this issue with my colleague Mr McCreevy, who is in charge of the services directive."
"I see it more from the consumer protection point of view, which is what I referred to earlier."
"The reason for the exclusion of car hire from our directives is that it is considered to be a transport issue, therefore it has to be dealt with specifically under that legislation."
"But I shall be very happy to take up this suggestion with my colleague and see how we can make sure that both consumers and the industry benefit from European legislation."
"Since they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"The ban on Polish food imports into Russia has been in place for almost six months now."
"Talks on lifting the ban have been in progress practically since the day it was first imposed, but all they have produced to date is additional Russian demands."
"Despite having said that it would help to solve the conflict, the Commission seems thus far to have confined itself to the role of passive observer."
"In the meantime, Polish exporters are estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of euros."
"It should also be noted that this estimate represents only the value of half a year's imports into Russia and takes no account of the heaviest loss, namely that of the relevant segment of the Russian market, which it will be extremely difficult for Polish firms to recover in the future."
"Furthermore, there are many signs that this situation was in fact engineered with a view to permanently removing Polish food producers from the Russian market."
"During the last round of talks (26 April 2006) the Russian side demanded, among other things, that Poland should specify a border crossing for Polish agricultural products bound for the Russian market."
"This demand, which is out of all proportion to the offences allegedly committed by Polish suppliers and is, for obvious reasons, unacceptable to the Polish Government, is further proof that Russia is deliberately setting prohibitive conditions for Poland."
"Given this situation, the Commission has an obligation under the accession treaties to intervene in the matter."
"I should therefore like to know what practical steps the Commission is going to take in this connection, and when."
"What action has the Commission taken on behalf of the Union with a view to putting an end to the absurd embargo Polish meat exports to Ukraine and Russia?"
"."
"It is true that both questions deal with more or less the same issue, so I will cover them in one reply."
"I am aware of the problems raised regarding Polish exports to Russia and more recently Ukraine and the Commission is involved – and my services as well – in trying to sort out the situation."
"I had meetings with Russian officials and tried to emphasize that from the technical, the veterinary point of view, the Polish authorities are committed to the necessary measures to make sure that the Russian concerns are addressed."
"It is very important – and we insisted on this with the Russian authorities – that solutions are found as quickly as possible."
"It is also extremely important that the Polish authorities implement these agreed measures and convince the Russian authorities that they have been implemented and are now in force."
"In that respect, my services will visit Poland very soon to work together with the Polish authorities to gather this evidence which can be used in negotiations and discussions with the Russian side."
"My colleague Mr Mandelson has been dealing with this issue from the trade point of view, especially since, from a technical point of view, the requirements have been met, and it now becomes a trade issue."
"We also raised the matter in our discussions within the context of Russia's WTO accession negotiations."
"It is important that Russia's SPS measures comply with the WTO SPS Agreement."
"We are following this issue."
"We are in constant communication and coordination with the Polish authorities and now it has been agreed that the Commission will formally participate in the discussions with the Polish and Russian sides."
"At the beginning, given that it related to exports which fall under the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission was facilitating the discussions but could not be part of them."
"Nevertheless, not only has it now been agreed by both sides, but also, given that some of the issues raised by Russia relate to the exports of other Member States through Poland and also to European Community legislation as a whole, it provides legal standing for the Commission also to be involved in these discussions."
"As I said, our experts will shortly visit Poland to gather information and evidence to be used during the meetings with the Russian side."
"As far as the Ukraine measures are concerned, the Commission met with the Ukrainian Chief Veterinary Officer in April, and asked him to speed up efforts to get the problem solved."
"It that Ukraine has agreed to lift the ban, but it has not taken place yet."
"Today there was to be a meeting between the European Union and Ukraine – the Sub-Committee on Trade – and this issue would be raised there too."
"We will follow this issue very closely and will continue to play an active role, but it is also very important that Poland actively demonstrates to its trade partner that legitimate concerns are taken seriously and are being met."
"In that effort also, we will support Poland."
"Madam President, I would like to express my warm thanks to the Commission for its interest in the issue of Poland’s exports to the Russian and Ukrainian markets."
"I would, however, also like to point out that this problem has so far remained unresolved for seven months."
"Polish exporters have incurred extremely serious financial losses."
"If the situation continues, these losses will be even greater."
"Moreover, a number of exporters will be pushed out of the Russian and Ukrainian markets for good."
"We therefore urge the European Commission to take decisive action on this matter."
"First of all, this is not the first time – at least during my term – that we have had problems with exports through Russia."
"That is why it is extremely important for Member States not to give any excuse for the introduction of bans, because once they are introduced it is very difficult to have them lifted."
"Therefore, it is very important that both EU legislation and bilateral agreements are strictly implemented by every Member State so as not to give this initial justification for the introduction of bans."
"At the same time, it is true that it has been going on for some time, but there were problems in communications between Russia and Poland and, as I said, from the beginning this was a bilateral issue, so we could only facilitate."
"Nevertheless, we intervened, we brought the parties together and, through mediation, we managed to reach an agreement."
"Now we are following very closely the developments in this tripartite meeting, in which we will also be involved, and will try to resolve this issue as soon as possible."
"– Do you believe, Commissioner, that these problems will delay Russia's membership of the WTO?"
"."
"I do not think so, because it seems that Russia is ready to accept the WTO’s SPS requirements."
"Nevertheless, it is not enough for Russia to accept these. It has to implement them as well."
"Therefore, these ‘clouds’ over the negotiations, while not blocking them, certainly create an unpleasant atmosphere."
"It is for that reason that it is important for Russia to implement these SPS requirements."
"Commissioner, given that you are going to speak with our Russian counterparts, I should like to ask one more question, which is along the same lines, but which this time concerns Georgia."
"You are aware that Russia has imposed an identical embargo on Georgian wine."
"Given that Georgia is covered by the ‘new neighbourhood’ initiative and that an action plan has been put in place on its behalf, are you familiar with this matter and, if not, can you look into it with a view to finding out what response Russia intends to give to Georgia?"
"."
"I am not aware of it."
"It does not fall under my sphere of responsibility, but I would be very happy to refer the issue to my colleague who is responsible for that area and see what she can make of the situation."
"Mauritania, a member of the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, has been undergoing democratic transition since the overthrow of President Ould Taya's dictatorial regime on 4 August 2005."
"The Military Council has pledged to carry out the reforms required to achieve democratisation and to lead the country into free elections and has also promised to ensure that no member of the current government stands in the elections."
"Although reforms are under way and the election timetable has been set, Mauritania is appealing to the international community, and the European Union in particular, to assist it in its transition to democracy."
"Does the Commission intend to provide technical and political support for the preparation and holding of free and fair elections?"
"In its specific geopolitical position, joining black Africa to the Maghreb, is Mauritania able to apply to join the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly?"
"."
"The undertakings made by the Mauritanian Government as regards respect for democratic principles when the consultations were opened under Article 96 were centred on the re-establishment of a properly-functioning democracy and the rule of law."
"Commissioner, I can tell you that I am altogether dissatisfied with the response given."
"I regret that Mr Michel is not here because he is very well acquainted with the subject of Mauritania."
"I believe that the Commission could have provided more information in view of the in August, given that it proposed to dispatch a European Union delegation for the purposes of monitoring the elections being held there."
"I would remind you that a referendum is due to take place in that country at the end of June."
"Consequently, are you able to tell us whether this delegation will have a short- or a long-term mission regarding the elections?"
"As I am sure that the honourable Member is aware, the lateral timetable set by the Mauritania transition authorities is as follows: referendum on 25 June, municipal and legislative elections on 19 November, senatorial elections on 21 January 2007 and presidential elections on 11 March 2007 (first round) and 25 March 2007 (second round)."
"This 19-month schedule is tighter than the 24-month period initially planned by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy."
"Its aim is a return to constitutional and democratic rule by the end of May 2007 at the latest."
"When consultations were opened under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, Mauritania gave undertakings in the areas of respect for democratic principles, fundamental rights and freedoms, the rule of law and good governance."
"The European Union declared its willingness to provide support for the implementation of these undertakings and decided to support the transition process in Mauritania during the consultation period itself by means of institutional support projects."
"In particular, a EUR 6 million technical support project for the electoral processes was drawn up by the Commission and approved in April 2006."
"The European Community’s financial contribution of approximately 75% of total donor contributions will be implemented by the UN Development Programme."
"The project’s specific objective is to strengthen the capacities and resources of the national independent electoral commission, the Ministry of Justice and civil society."
"It is also aimed at helping to ensure that the elections are free, fair and transparent, are conducted efficiently and lead to results that are nationally and internationally recognised and legitimate."
"Regarding observation of the electoral processes, the Commission plans to send a team of electoral experts in early June 2006 around now to help with the constitutional referendum and, in July, a fact-finding mission to assess the advisability, usefulness and feasibility of future observation missions as well as, if necessary, electoral observation missions to observe the general and municipal elections in November 2006 and the presidential elections in March 2007."
"As you know, Mauritania is not a member of either ECOWAS, which it left in 2000 or UEMOA, but it is a member of the Arab-Magreb Union."
"The country takes part in the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean dialogue as an observer, and formally applied for membership at the end of May 2005."
"No response to that request can be given before the country returns to constitutional and democratic rule."
"What is the Commission's view of the situation for Christians in Nigeria, and what action is it taking, within the context of development cooperation, to strengthen the rule of law and freedom of religion in this important African country?"
"."
"The Commission attaches great importance to the rights of freedom of religion, belief and expression in its dialogues with third countries."
"Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief is one of the fundamental human rights and, as such, is enshrined in a number of international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In addition, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights makes clear that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that cultural, religious and linguistic diversity should be respected."
"Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law underpins the Cotonou Partnership signed by the ACP States and the Community and its Member States."
"Article 8 of the agreement indicates the topics on which regular political dialogues should focus, referring specifically to ethnic, religious and racial discrimination."
"There is no state religion in Nigeria."
"In 1999, the Constitution provided for freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the federal government generally respects those freedoms."
"The Constitution also prohibits state and local government from adopting an official religion."
"However, state governors have great autonomy and it is alleged that Islam has been adopted de facto as a state religion in several northern states."
"The return of Nigeria to democracy in 1999 has seen an improvement in the human rights situation, but it has also seen an increase in tensions and violent conflicts, which currently provide the most threatening challenges to the new democratic Nigeria."
"In this complex and unstable situation, the Commission has been trying to identify the most common causes of conflicts with the objective of helping to address and prevent them."
"Conflicts and violence have historically marked relationships between Muslims and Christians, particularly in the central states, where communities of different religions are numerically equivalent."
"It is generally not possible to cast Muslims or Christians systematically in the role of aggressor or victim, as they have historically been both."
"It is apparent, however, that conflicts always involve extremely poor people and that conflicts presented as religiously motivated are often triggered by other causes, including conflicts between traditional rulers, land and resource struggles amongst communities, political in-fighting, and tensions between state and federal governments."
"The significance of the tension between indigenes and non-indigenes is crucial to understanding the frequent cause of conflicts in Nigeria."
"A recent report by Human Rights Watch, 'They do not own this place', blames the federal government policies that discriminate amongst non-indigenes, defined as people who, no matter how long they have lived in an area, cannot trace their origins to the ethnic and genealogical roots of the original inhabitants of that area."
"In a country with more than 250 ethnic groups, these discriminatory practices spreading at state and local government level have relegated millions of Nigerians to the status of second-class citizens, increased poverty and created the conditions for intercommunal violence."
"According to Father George Ehusani, secretary-general of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 'poverty in Nigeria has assumed the moral character of war and that is what you see reflected in much of the ethnic violence in this country'."
"The Commission and the EU Member States are engaged in regular dialogue in Nigeria to promote respect for human rights, basic freedoms and the rule of law among communities, religious and ethnic groups, state and federal authorities."
"Since the first Niger Delta crisis in November 2004, regular visits of the EU Heads of Mission have been organised to various areas: the Niger Delta, some northern states and some middle-belt states."
"While one of the focal sectors of EU development cooperation with Nigeria is supporting and promoting good governance at federal and state level, the Commission is also engaged in financing Community projects in the Niger Delta and is about to approve a project to support non-state actors."
"Moreover, the EC budget lines have for years been financing projects to promote democracy and human rights."
"– Many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply."
"While I far prefer Commissioner Kroes to Commissioner Michel, that has less to do with him than with her, but I would nevertheless like to ask why he is not here today."
"Secondly, I would like to know what the Commission is doing about bringing up the specific issue of the introduction of sharia law in certain Nigerian states, and the acts of violence that are actually being perpetrated, including the killing of Christians and the burning down of churches in the central states, to which you have already referred."
"."
"You can be assured that this is something very important for my colleague."
"Mr Michel is most fond of the debates in your House, so I am not aware what the specific reason is, but I am absolutely sure that if he could have made it then he would have done, but I think he is travelling, perhaps to the regions you are interested in."
"I want to underline that the Commission is fully engaged in the effort to combat extremism of all types through its overall efforts to address the root causes of discontent and to promote peace, stability and security through its development cooperation and assistance."
"In addition, it is engaged in numerous specific initiatives to promote peaceful coexistence between peoples, as well as inter-religious and intercultural understanding."
"Political dialogue with the central government and support to institutional development is a main issue."
"Can the European Commission make a comprehensive statement as to how much financial support the EU is giving to combat Aids in Africa and explain the nature of this support as well as listing the countries who are beneficiaries of this financial support?"
"."
"The European Community's efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa are financed by the European Development Fund and the budget of the European Community."
"Within the framework of national and regional programming, the EDF finances projects to fight AIDS and projects aimed at strengthening healthcare systems."
"Since 2002, 15 national projects and three regional projects to fight AIDS and/or strengthen healthcare systems have been initiated in 13 countries and in the ACP region, representing a total commitment of EUR 244.6 million."
"The EDF also supports the implementation of national poverty reduction plans and therefore, directly or indirectly, the fight against AIDS by providing general budget support."
"Since 2002 the Commission has provided general budget support to 24 African countries with commitments representing around EUR 2.4 billion."
"Already EUR 1.5 billion of that has been spent."
"The European Community's budget has a thematic budget line to help combat poverty-related diseases – not only AIDS, but also malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries."
"The budget line is based on Regulation 1568/2003."
"Since 2002 the Commission has allocated on that line more than EUR 86.2 million to NGOs as a contribution to 25 projects combating HIV/AIDS being implemented in 16 African countries."
"A total of EUR 9.42 million has also been allocated to two research projects: one in central Africa and the other in southern Africa."
"A total of EUR 5 million has been allocated to large-scale awareness programmes, as well as to international partnerships, such as the International Partnership for Microbicides and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative."
"A second budget line relating to health, reproductive and sexual rights in developing countries, based on Regulation 1567/2003, also contributes to the fight against AIDS."
"EUR 73.95 million is available on this line for 2003-2006."
"Since 2003, the Commission has been able to allocate on this line EUR 17.5 million for 10 projects for the fight against AIDS implemented in eight African countries."
"The Commission's budget also finances projects to combat AIDS and strengthen healthcare systems in South Africa, on the basis of Regulation 1726."
"Since 2002, three projects are being undertaken in South Africa for a total amount of EUR 55 million."
"The EDF and EC budget are the two sources of EC contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"The European Commission has contributed EUR 522 million to the Global Fund since the latter's creation in 2001, and this amount has been supplemented by contributions from EU Member States."
"We are the leading donor to the GFFATM; 57% of the funds go to the fight against HIV/AIDS and 55% are allocated to African countries."
"Moreover, the European Community is devoting increasing funds to research programmes targeting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"For the period 2002-2006, the financing devoted to these three diseases, most of which funds go to HIV/AIDS, quadrupled, reaching EUR 400 million currently."
"Half of those funds are managed by the European Community, DG Research, and the other half, to which is added EUR 400 million from EU Member States and the private sector, are funnelled through the European and developing countries' clinical trial partnership."
"The Commission does not have any details on aid from the Member States to African countries in the fight against HIV/AIDS because this information has not been made available to us."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for her comprehensive answer to my question."
"Could the Commissioner tell me whether discussions or negotiations are taking place between the major pharmaceutical companies regarding the supply of antiretroviral drugs to people in Africa?"
"If so, how extensive are they?"
"Has any progress been made and have these drugs been made more widely available to people?"
"."
"I gather from the papers that discussions are being held."
"However, I should like you to permit me, Madam President, to ask my colleague to give you a written answer that is to the point and states precisely what stage the discussions have reached."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report (A6-0172/2006) by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13 September 2005 (Case C-176/03 Commission v Council) [2006/2007(INI)]."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by apologising for the absence of Mr Gargani, who is unable to be present by reason of illness."
"Members of my own Group have asked me to stand in for him today as rapporteur and to say something about the content of this report."
"I will start by observing that this ruling by the Court of Justice came as no surprise – at any rate, not to me."
"There may well have been many who thought that things would not turn out this way, but I actually see this as no more than a logical conclusion, since we have for some time in the past seen the Commission adopt varying – sometimes widely divergent – approaches to legislative proposals relating to criminal law."
"Drawing on my practical experience in the field of business law, I just want to point out that many past directives proposed on the basis of legal bases in the first pillar – for example, those on money-laundering and market abuse, or the provisions on insider trading – have included at least elements of criminal law."
"It is in fact perfectly right and proper that the Court of Justice should, very often in the past, and even when the facts of the case were different, have worked on the principle that the issue of which legal basis should be decisive should be decided by reference to the objective of the proposal as a whole."
"It was therefore perfectly obvious that the Court of Justice should, in this case, decide on the basis of a specific example from environmental law that, here too, it is not possible to take legal acts that in fact belong together and split them up in such a way that certain aspects are taken to refer to a part of the Treaties other than the actual objective that was originally in mind, where this falls under the first pillar."
"The result, then, comes as no surprise to me."
"What, though, are the consequences now?"
"In the first place, it does nothing to change the fact that criminal law is treated primarily as a matter for the Member States, for the national level, where Europe has powers only under exceptional circumstances."
"This being so, I too take the view that the European legislator – who may be able to make use of this instrument, but is not required to use it in a coercive manner – is well-advised, as a matter of principle, to refrain from legislation in matters of criminal law."
"In every specific situation, decisions must be reached on a case-by-case basis, on the basis of whether or not criminal law provisions are needed in order to achieve this objective, or whether it ought to be left to the Member States to decide these matters and regulate them."
"Caution, then, needs to be the order of the day for the legislator, whether that be Parliament or the Council, and that above all, I believe – and this is why the Treaties, from the outset, leave criminal law in the hands of the Member States – quite simply because the systems of criminal law in Europe are so very, very different, not only in terms of deciding what is a crime, but also in terms of how that crime should be punished."
"There are Member States in which the sentence is enforced in full; there are others in which, as a rule, only 50% is paid; others in which it is two-thirds; still others in which the courts order additional penalties of a punitive nature, which, in turn, do not exist in that form in other Member States."
"I do believe, then, that if Europe starts, where it is not necessary to do so, to lay down standard penalties for all manner of things, then the consequence of that will be unsystematic interventions in the criminal law systems of the Member States, and, since the usefulness of that is a matter of doubt, it is for that reason above all others that we should exercise a degree of self-restraint."
"I see the report that Mr Gargani has produced, and which has been adopted by the Committee, as putting that into effect, and see that as its essential substance."
"We are of course in favour of the idea that the Commission should now attempt to analyse, one by one, the proposals that need to be revised on the grounds that their division into two different legal acts no longer corresponds to the law as laid down by the Court of Justice, and should then come up with proposals as to how adjustments can be made."
"As for the amendments submitted in response to the Committee on Legal Affairs’ resolution, I am able to say, on behalf of my group, that some of these – particularly those tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – are acceptable, while others are not."
"Please do not expect me to go into details, for I have agreed this with the rapporteur, but I can say in general terms that there were no fundamental differences within the Committee on Legal Affairs when it came to evaluating these issues."
"The problems lie more in the nuances, perhaps in the issue of how far one should actually go in individual cases, but otherwise, the committee was in general agreement on this."
"I thank the House most warmly for its attention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gargani;"
"Mr Lehne, who is standing in for him this evening; and Mr Cavada, for the joint work that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs have done on this important dossier."
"I think that one of the qualities of this decision, which recognises the value added by the Community, is the fundamental role that the European Parliament will be able to play in important issues such as the application of criminal sanctions under the codecision procedure."
"As you know, the Commission adopted a communication on this subject last November."
"We believe that the scope of this decision goes beyond the single issue of environmental protection."
"I believe, in fact, that there is a broader issue and I generally agree with the content of the Gargani report."
"I have to say that the Commission’s outlook is a little more ambitious in certain fields and in certain aspects."
"For example, the report specifically says that the legislator must restrict the application of criminal sanctions to cases where the protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms or the protection of financial interests is at stake."
"These are certainly extremely important interests that must be protected."
"Nevertheless, we believe it would be possible to go a little further, although the Court’s decision places restrictions on the application of criminal sanctions at a European level, and I do believe such limits are necessary."
"For instance, as Mr Lehne said just now, we need to think about a European criminal sanction when it is truly indispensable for ensuring that Community law is effective, while respecting the principle of the need for the criminal sanction and the principle of proportionality."
"At the same time, I think that an absolute limitation of the fields involved would be dangerous and would restrict what the Court of Justice has stated."
"We have put forward a proposal for a directive laying down criminal sanctions in the fight against counterfeiting."
"You are aware how dangerous counterfeiting is for industry in European countries and for consumer health, apart from causing the exploitation of child labour to produce fake goods."
"In view of that, how can anyone claim that sanctions at a European level are not needed in this area?"
"This is just one example and, precisely because of that, I support the idea that Mrs Roure and Mr Cavada have expressed in their amendments regarding a rather more ambitious broadening of the structure adopted by the rapporteur."
"To conclude, I should like to express my sincere gratitude because I have found in the report a restatement of the principle of the so-called ‘bridging clause’ – which is the possibility of moving from the principle of unanimity under the third pillar towards a codecision and qualified majority procedure, in other words a Community procedure under the first pillar – in the area of cooperation in criminal justice and cooperation in police and security matters."
"That is something that the Commission had already said that it was hoping for and I think it is a positive sign that it has been reiterated in the Gargani report as well."
"– The criminal law of this ambitious Europe is still very much in its infancy."
"Loose consensuses and tentative progress show the Member States’ resistance to the future and the disgraceful contradiction of a Community policy that is on the one hand based on shared fundamental values but on the other leaves the law underpinning these values to the discretion of individual Member States."
"It was this irony that the Constitutional Treaty attempted to remove and that the Court interpreted as favourably as it could."
"Europe’s institutions have said that European criminal law is based on the simple principle of mutual recognition. Unless this view is reversed, Europe will never have criminal law or an area of freedom, security and justice in the truest sense, because Europe is a global justice project rather than a project based on preferential areas of justice."
"Yet what is emerging is that Europe lacks a common area with a shared project in the field of criminal law."
"It is, rather, a fragmented mosaic of borders; harmonisation has been piecemeal and low-level; there is no political or criminal-law programme to be followed; there has been harmonisation of the minimum level of maximum sentences. All of which illustrates our lack of courage."
"Harmonisation is only apparent in sentencing, and does not cover the causes of crime, alternative sentencing or methodologies."
"In a Europe that stands for the dignity of all citizens, for the values that underpin that dignity, for the rule of law, for proportionality and for equality, what is required is a criminal justice programme. Yet in terms of the way in which powers are distributed, what we have is criminal law that is absurdly removed from the values that it guarantees; it is criminal law that follows a hard line in the Council insofar as it is not shared democratically among the parliaments."
"What this shows is mutual recognition of individual criminal justice systems without any essential base of harmonisation. This is utterly iniquitous."
"We do not want this, but it is happening in Europe, because criminal law is the highest expression of values."
"We await the broader scope of the Treaty and more importantly, the strong political will that is taking a long time to materialise."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, even in his absence, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, although I do have to say that we in the committee would very much have preferred it if there had been some sort of negotiation between the groups to spare us the necessity of settling our various differences of opinion here in the plenary."
"I would also like to have seen greater account taken of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has been considering this matter with us."
"The consequence of that has been that we have had to table a relatively large number of amendments for the plenary."
"I hope that we will achieve a very broad majority when we come to the vote."
"This issue is of great importance for the further development of Community law, and I think that calls for a broad majority."
"Where, now, are the differences of opinion?"
"The rapporteur, in his original report, proposed a relatively restrictive approach in handling this ruling from the Court of Justice, but we, on the contrary, favour the Commission’s interpretation, according to which the Court’s ruling allows us to impose criminal sanctions in every area of Community law, albeit not subject to limitations, but with the conditions set down by the Court, and with the ultimate purpose of enforcing Community law."
"We on the Committee on Legal Affairs find ourselves dealing, time and time again, with issues around the application of European law, and we have to say that there are serious deficiencies in this area."
"We should not, at a stroke and once and for all, deny ourselves an option that the European Court of Justice has put in our hands."
"We do understand that there are particular concerns about the coherence of criminal law in the Member States, and these are voiced particularly by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice, who do not want ministers with first-pillar remits, so to speak, ruining their national criminal law systems; we have accommodated these concerns by means of amendments, particularly those adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As Mr Lehne has already said, we are largely agreed among ourselves on the need for a case-by-case examination of all legal acts, which are in need of renovation."
"We in this House have submitted one other, on which the deadline had not yet been reached, to the ECJ."
"If a new legal basis demands the codecision procedure, then this House will not be able to evade the necessity of using all its legislative prerogatives."
"We will not be able to accept a prior interinstitutional agreement in which we sign away our right to play a part in shaping these new legal acts, but that should not be taken to mean that we will not strive for good cooperation with the Commission and the Council if revision measures prove to be necessary."
"."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 relating to Community powers in the area of criminal law are so momentous that this judgment really marks a break in the development of Community law."
"It can even be assumed that under certain circumstances this precedent might have a negative effect on the sovereignty of the Member States."
"The condition for its application to Community norm-setting arising from the First Pillar of the EU will therefore be strict adherence to the principle of subsidiarity as established in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and in the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"This principle is directly connected to the need for European lawmakers to see that the enactment of criminal sanctions under the First Pillar is an exception, restricted to cases where there is an unavoidable need to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens and the main interests of the EU."
"It is also essential that the effects and overall impact of the criminal law norms passed on the basis of the First Pillar are thoroughly and painstakingly monitored and assessed."
"Another area where the Commission is proposing criminal sanctions is the protection of intellectual property rights."
"This area undoubtedly represents one of the main activities of the Community arising from Article 2 of the EC Treaty."
"I think, and I will say it again, that this area is so important and so rapidly developing that it requires a specific conceptual and systematic approach."
"I consider it essential to develop a well-rounded concept for protecting intellectual property rights, which will include among other things criminal law measures."
"Mr President, this issue shows up the most basic weakness in the whole EU structure."
"All countries agree to be bound by the same body of EU law, which they then undertake to enforce upon themselves."
"It must have been obvious from the start that some countries would apply EU law more vigorously than others."
"So what we are now seeing is the beginning of attempts to harmonise criminal justice, notwithstanding Mr Gargani’s request for checks and limits."
"The ECJ will have a wonderful time deciding whether national sentencing meets its criteria of being proportional and dissuasive."
"Mr Gargani acknowledges that it will be hard to achieve uniform enforcement."
"Indeed, do we really expect courts to behave in the same way in all 25 EU countries, including our new eastern European Member States and those who are yet to join?"
"I fear that politicians will agree to progressively harmonise enforcement, but the peoples of our different countries will not."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on 13 September 2005, the Court of Justice of the European Communities granted the Community legislator the opportunity to take legal measures so as to guarantee the effectiveness of the rules decreed by the Court."
"Everyone understood this to mean – at any rate, those in Vienna understood it to mean – that the Court had turned the principle of subsidiarity inside out like a sock in order to decide that, on the subject of Community law, there was no point in the Member States taking care to ensure that it was complied with since the Commission of Brussels was able to do so all by itself."
"The Commission has obviously not failed to step into this breach: while, strictly speaking, this new legal power only concerns the environment, a Commission communication of November 2005 makes more widespread use of this power to incorporate other subjects, including the four freedoms, the CAP and fishing."
"Mr Cavada, our draftsman, even extends this power to include discriminatory behaviour, which can cover all human activities and even the protection of the Union’s financial interests."
"It is here that one can see the danger of this umpteenth show of strength by the judges of Luxembourg."
"On 6 April 2006, scarcely two months ago, in fact, the European Court of First Instance ordered Mr Frattini – the Commission – to pay damages and interest to an official on the grounds of a serious and obvious violation of the requirement for impartiality."
"Violation by whom?"
"By OLAF, that is to say by the anti-fraud office, which is partly controlled by the Commission."
"Thus, to grant legal powers to this Commission, on the subject of which the Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 1 of 2005, notes that respect for the fundamental rights of persons subject to an inquiry is not guaranteed, means running the risk of creating, at the Berlaymont, a little centre in which people’s liberties are infringed, a kind of regulatory mini-Guantanamo."
"The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Cavada, is, moreover, aware of the problem since he is calling for the judgment to be applied with prudence and he might have added: with jurisprudence, the prudence of the law and, in particular, of the law of the Treaties, which does not permit the powers of the third pillar to be transferred to the first pillar."
"However, since 1962 and its Costa versus ENEL judgment, the Court has been imprudently and continuously carrying out a federal ."
"As the great British legal expert, Dicey, said: judges must be lions, but lions under the throne, being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty."
"Putting someone in prison is a matter for criminal law."
"It is not a trivial matter."
"Mr President, although I am a lawyer I am not here to accuse Commissioner Frattini of anything at all this evening, he will be pleased to hear, other than to say that I think this is such an important ruling that the consequences of it seem to me to be far from clear at this time."
"I believe there is a danger here of over-applying the principle of Community competence into national domestic criminal law and indeed, following as it does from the remarks of Chancellor Schüssel at the start of the Austrian Presidency calling for the ECJ to hand powers back to Member States, it does not seem to me to sit too easily in that context."
"I welcome, however, the generally cautious approach and the limited interpretation of the ruling which is to apply to a very few isolated cases set out in both the Gargani report and the Commissioner’s response."
"I think that the exercise of any form of legal precedent here must be controlled very strongly and effectively."
"I think that competence in criminal law is national, not European, in general terms, and I think the presumption must remain in that way."
"Whatever the general arguments, I disagree with the Commissioner."
"There is absolutely no justification to call for the activation of the passerelle clause in Article 42 of the Treaty on the basis of this ruling itself."
"Indeed, if we were to do that it would set quite a dangerous and unwelcome precedent."
"At the end of the day, my view is that whilst this is an unusual ruling, it has to be looked at on an individual basis and in a limited application."
"Any attempt by the Commission or the Court to try to use this in a more extensive way would be unacceptable and would call into question the operations of the ECJ in this field."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission for its communication on the consequences of the judgment of the Court on criminal sanctions and I agree with the conclusions it makes."
"Indeed, I believe that the interpretation of this judgment should not apply solely to the environment, and this so as to strengthen Parliament's democratic control and to thus enable Europeans to be better protected."
"The Court judgment has made it possible to clarify the powers in relation to criminal provisions between the first and the third pillar."
"It therefore stipulates that the aim and content of the act itself be taken into account in order to establish the need for criminal sanctions to be laid down."
"That allows us to conclude that the protection of fundamental rights is an area to which the consequences of this judgment can be extended."
"Special attention should be paid to fundamental rights and to the protection of the Union's interests when resorting to criminal sanctions."
"I do not believe, however, that we had to limit ourselves to resorting to these two areas alone, and Amendment 16, which I tabled with my colleague, Mrs Berger, is along these lines."
"That is why I call on you to support it."
"Finally, this judgment is a new signal calling on us to provide for, by means of Article 42, and as you have said, the communitisation of all aspects of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"I will say it this evening: this would make it possible to ensure greater legal certainty and, above all, more coherent criminal measures."
"Mr President, I rather think that the September judgment represents a very exciting challenge."
"I taught law for many years at various universities, and this report by the committee for which Mr Gargani was rapporteur would not be given particularly high marks by the Faculty of Law at the University of Copenhagen. Firstly, there is a contradiction, which is ignored."
"Point 47 of the judgment states that criminal legislation and the rules for dealing with criminal matters – that is to say criminal procedural law – do not fall within the Community’s competence. For all that, the judgment then takes a huge political leap forward by stating that this finding cannot, however, prevent the Community legislature from taking measures relating to the criminal law of the Member States under certain conditions in which such action is found to be necessary."
"It is my humble conviction that this procedure – whereby, in the absence of an existing legal base, we ourselves create a legal base on political foundations - is absurd. Moreover, it will most certainly meet with serious resistance in the best developed democracies in the European Union."
"In this connection I would be so bold as to refer to the Nordic democracies."
"These countries will not join a system that can manipulate the legal base in such a way, quite apart from the fact that it is, of course, perfectly reasonable for criminal legislation and procedure to fall within the competence of the Member States, this being – as was also said at the start – a state of affairs that, to a large degree, reflects a legal tradition that cannot be harmonised and should not be dictated."
"There is therefore no legal base, and I would for that reason recommend voting in favour of the amendment tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group."
"– Mr President, I am somewhat surprised at the Commission’s explanation of the Court’s ruling."
"In 2002, I backed the Oomen-Ruijten report and also the appeal against the framework decision, but at the time, the Commission repeatedly impressed on us that the directive and appeal against the decision should not be seen as a first step towards harmonisation of criminal law in other areas."
"It was on the basis of that guarantee alone that I was able to support the appeal against the framework decision at the time."
"It now turns out that the Commission is giving the ruling an interpretation entirely of its own, would like to extend it still further, and is also seeking harmonisation in other areas."
"This contradicts what we were told at the time."
"Had I known in 2002 what I know now, I would have voted against the Oomen-Ruijten report."
"The Gargani report does contain a few positive points, including paragraphs 8 and 13, but as long as paragraphs 4 and 5 are included, I, together with my group, have no choice but to vote against the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the creation of a unified legal system based on common values and the principles of the primacy of Community law and close cooperation between the Member States and the European institutions is imperative in order to facilitate the proper functioning of the single internal market of the European Union."
"All activities aimed at ensuring effective Community legislation based on the first pillar deserve our support."
"The first pillar is the only one that allows European legislation to be adopted while respecting democratic principles, and that ensures appropriate judicial control."
"The European Court of Justice ruling of 13 September is extremely important for the future development of Community law."
"The Court ruled that, in order to define clearly the legal basis of a document, a reference must be made to the aims and the content of the document itself."
"As a result, the Framework Decision on environmental protection was annulled due to the legal basis being misquoted as the third rather than the first pillar."
"In view of this ruling, current legislative proposals whose legal basis may be considered erroneous have to be withdrawn or modified."
"Furthermore, we must consider the possibility of starting a legislative procedure aimed at finding a new legal basis for legislative texts adopted under the third pillar which may now, in line with the ruling, be considered to have an erroneous basis."
"However, the Court’s conclusions should not be automatically extended to include all fields covered by the first pillar."
"They should be applied to areas which are covered by the basic principles, aims and competences of the Community and specific cases should be investigated on an individual basis within the framework of close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament."
"The Member States are in principle responsible for the appropriate implementation of Community law."
"That is why the premise for including criminal law articles under the first pillar should be clear and defined ."
"Mr President, someone is cruelly missing from this Chamber this evening, although he was here this afternoon."
"How can we tolerate the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that this crucial debate on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13 September 2005 is taking place in the absence of the main party involved, the Council itself?"
"Was it the Council that imposed this agenda so as to avoid having to publicly acknowledge the profound meaning of its defeat on 13 September in Luxembourg?"
"Allow me to act as its spokesperson this evening."
"Yes, the Council was defeated that day by a further judicial show of strength."
"Yes, despite the rejection of the ratification of the European Constitution that provided for it, the competence pillars have, in fact, just merged."
"There are no longer any intergovernmental powers in Europe."
"Yes, the Member States can see that an interpretation of the Treaties that they signed is being arbitrarily imposed on them."
"That is what the Chairman of the French Constitutional Council, Pierre Mazot, calls France’s vitiated consent."
"Yes, this uncontrolled communitisation of criminal law knows no bounds because, while it was at it, the Commission decided to annul nine framework-decisions, a move that, after the environment, will enable it to lay its hands on criminal law in relation to illegal immigration, to marine pollution and even to intellectual property."
"I ask you, ladies and gentlemen – and particularly the French Members among us – what purpose do our Interior and our Justice ministers now serve?"
"On behalf of my group, I tabled Amendment 1, which is a very sensible amendment and one to which every independent Member could easily be won over."
"It is an alternative that simply calls on the Member States to regain control of the treaties that they sign."
"Yet, how many independent Members are there in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen?"
"Continue to get round the nations with your federalisation of the legal system and your other plan B and you will see 2007 replicate 2005."
"Mr President, by means of the Framework Decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law, the Council aimed to respond to the worrying increase in crimes against the environment, and this objective should be applauded."
"However, we cannot applaud the way in which the Council has acted, as it has led to a dispute and a twofold dispute at that."
"The first dispute is institutional, as the Treaties in force do not provide a simple and clear answer as to who should do what in the EU."
"As a result, there is no clear division of competences between the institutions of the Union and particularly between the Council, the Member States and Parliament."
"The second level of the dispute concerns the legal basis cited by the Council when making its controversial decision."
"The Council mistakenly cited the third pillar as the legal basis when the subject matter does not fall under the third pillar but under the competences of the EU in the field of environmental protection."
"Therefore, the Council did not have the right to make the aforementioned decision."
"By doing so, it impinged on the competences granted to the Community on the basis of the Community Treaty and infringed the Treaty on European Union, which grants priority to these competences."
"Furthermore, by choosing an inappropriate legal basis, the Council prevented the European Parliament from having any influence on matters relating to the protection of the environment which, without a doubt, are Community issues and fall within its remit."
"I am sure that if the European Union had a constitution which set out the competences and defined who does what in the European Union, then this dispute would not be taking place."
"We would have clear legal guidelines and the European Court of Justice would not be required to intervene."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0192/2006) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters [COM(2005)0475 C6-0436/2005 2005/0202(CNS)]."
"."
"Mr President, the European Union is renowned in the world for the high level of protection of fundamental rights and, in particular, of protection of personal data that it guarantees its citizens."
"This principle is thus enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"In the Community context, two directives regulate the fair processing of these data in connection with the internal market, and when Europeans make a purchase via the Internet, for example, the company from which they make that purchase is obliged to request their permission to use their data in order to send them offers."
"Europeans are therefore informed of the way in which their data is used and, fundamentally, they can request that those data be rectified."
"However, this European area of data protection has a serious deficiency right now."
"There is no coordination among the 25 Member States when it comes to protecting the personal data used in the context of police or judicial work."
"At a time when we are working towards the implementation of a European area of freedom, security and justice, this coordination has become absolutely crucial."
"Indeed, the Member States' police forces need to work in close cooperation with each other and exchange information in order to combat organised crime effectively."
"We can enhance this cooperation, but we must make sure that data relating to Europeans is protected in the same way throughout Europe."
"I would point out that the European Parliament has, for many years now, been calling for an instrument designed to protect data in the context of judicial and police cooperation."
"Consequently, we welcome this proposal by the Commission, and the purpose of my report is to enhance this proposal so as to ensure coherence with the existing data protection instruments coming under the first pillar."
"We also want this framework-decision not to be limited to the information exchanged among the Member States, but to ensure a minimal level of data protection within the Member States themselves."
"Indeed, if that were not the case, we could thus have two different data protection systems being used in the same investigation."
"That would not only threaten the protection of Europeans, but would also complicate the work done by the police and the judiciary."
"We have enhanced the guarantees relating to the use of personal data by, and the transmission of personal data to, private parties when those parties process them in connection with public administration."
"We also want guarantees regarding the use of personal data by, and the transmission of personal data to, third countries."
"I would point out that the Court annulled this Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the United States on the processing and transmission of personal data, together with the Commission adequacy decision regarding the adequate level of protection of these data, and it did so on account of inappropriate legal bases, as you are aware."
"Mr Frattini told us that he wanted to submit a new proposal for an agreement on the basis of the third pillar."
"We therefore need data protection legislation for the third pillar, and I welcome the Commission’s support in this regard."
"When the directive on data retention was adopted in December 2005, the Council made a moral commitment before the European Parliament – I am keen to point this out - to swiftly adopt, while abiding by a form of sincere cooperation among the European institutions, the text on data protection."
"However, the adoption of this text has been severely delayed and there is now the danger that it will not be adopted in the course of this year."
"We therefore want the Council to make clear commitments before us today, especially on the crucial points for the European Parliament, and we are waiting for it to present us with a timeframe for the adoption of this framework-decision."
"I am very disappointed by the Council at the moment."
"If the Council were not to do this, then the European Parliament would feel betrayed and its confidence would be seriously shaken for the future, and we do not want that."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Roure, the rapporteur on this very important and well-balanced report."
"I recall that in the Hague Programme there is the clear obligation to ensure the exchange of law enforcement information under the principle of availability with effect from January 2008."
"At the same time, key conditions in the area of data protection shall be strictly observed."
"Therefore, the quick adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar is indispensable."
"Security policy, in particular anti-terrorist policy, must respect both the obligation of the State to protect citizens against serious crimes, including terrorism, as well as the fundamental rights of the citizens to their private and family life and to personal data protection."
"I believe that we must ensure that there is coherence and uniformity in the principles of data protection in the European Union, , between the first and the third pillar."
"The Judgment of the European Court on the PNR agreement, as Mrs Roure rightly said, shows the necessity of a coherent and complete data protection regime at European level, based on clear, substantial data protection principles."
"In this context, in my view, the framework decision would constitute an important step forward."
"The Commission has already proposed that the framework decision on data protection should be implemented by the end of 2006, before the application of the principle of availability."
"So I join the European Parliament and Mrs Roure in a plea to the Council to accelerate the agreement on the framework decision, taking into full account the position expressed by this Parliament."
"As far as the scope of the framework decision is concerned, as many chapters as possible must apply to domestic situations, as already proposed by the Commission."
"In my view Member States must agree on common data protection principles that apply to all processing of personal data by the police and the judicial authorities for the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, as the common basis for the exchange of personal data in full respect of such principles."
"As far as the Europol/Eurojust system is concerned, the Commission agrees that in principle further approximation and facilitation of the European data protection regime should be ensured after the adoption of the framework decision in consultation with all the bodies concerned."
"The concrete time schedule might need further examination."
"I am open to additional data protection safeguard specifications concerning biometric identifiers and/or DNA data and will look more closely at the European Parliament’s suggestions in this very important and sensitive field."
"Taking into account the position of Parliament, I will reflect on the concrete procedure for assessing the level of data protection in a third country or an international body."
"Now in the report you are to adopt a solution which would provide that the Commission, after consulting the Council and Parliament, may establish that a third country or an international body ensures an appropriate level of protection within the meaning of the framework decision."
"As you can guess, I am not personally against such a solution."
"We will have to work closely with the Council because we need unanimity so that the final solution in any case provides, first, a mechanism ensuring that when the other conditions provided for by the framework decision are met, an adequate level of protection exists; and second, that Parliament is consulted beforehand and that due account is taken of its opinion."
". – Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats attaches great importance to common guarantees for the protection of privacy at Union level."
"Not only will these nurture mutual trust between Member States with regard to the exchange of data, but will also benefit the prosecution of punishable offences and the willingness to exchange data for such prosecution."
"You are completely right when you point at the availability of data, because it is important that we can make real progress in that respect with a view to public safety."
"Before we can do this, this step must be taken to protect privacy."
"Looking back at previous discussions, I, on behalf of my group, should like to pay the rapporteur a huge compliment, for Mrs Roure has compiled a balanced report and the realistic and measured manner in which she handled the discussions with the Commission was a demonstration of her expertise."
"She backed us up all the way in a number of areas."
"Accordingly, we did not go as far as to want to ban the exchange of information with third countries."
"We came to the right decision together."
"Secondly, we refused to follow – and will refuse to do so in future – those who want secret services to fall within this remit."
"Thirdly, the rapporteur has not brought any pressure to bear on the Council either in order to stop the discussion of the reports on the Financial Information System (FIS) and the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) until this report has been completed."
"In doing so, Mrs Roure has done a great job."
"This is an even-handed report which strikes the right balance between protecting privacy on the one hand, and creating opportunities for the improved exchange of data on the other."
"This is something we owe to our citizens, if we really want the Union to do what it can to safeguard our security."
"Thank you once again, Mrs Roure, for your cooperation."
"Mr President, it makes eminent common sense in today’s world to have enhanced exchange of information and cooperation between our police services and, indeed, our judicial authorities."
"It is not possible, in my view, to combat transnational crime without such cooperation, whether the crime is driven by anti-democratic forces which use terror as a political weapon, or by straightforward self-enrichment through money laundering, people trafficking or drug smuggling."
"The cooperation needs to be both within the European Union and between the European Union and third countries, but it should not be allowed unless there is stringent protection for human rights and citizens’ freedoms."
"This is why I wholeheartedly support here tonight the proposal of my colleague, Mrs Roure, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Some of our Member States are resisting elements of the proposed cooperation, not on grounds of protecting human rights but on purely ideological grounds of protecting national sovereignty."
"This might at least be understandable if they were consistent."
"However, the selfsame states are quite happily prepared to accept at face value assurances from the US about its extraordinary rendition network, which transfers suspects from country to country, in and out of EU territory and even to third countries where we know that torture is used."
"This practice is trampling all over our Member States’ sovereignty and the US has even admitted that it does not accept our definitions of torture."
"Our Member States should cooperate while insisting on proper protection concerning the use of information and for the people about whom information is exchanged, as is proposed be done in this report."
"To be consistent, however, our Member States must in practice also insist that the US respect the civil and human rights of the people it has illegally transported, and follow up their call that Guantánamo should be closed by making it clear to the US that its approach is increasing the threat of terror and is the best recruiting sergeant that fundamentalists of all persuasions have had for many years."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Mrs Roure deserves warm thanks for this report, which has already received deservedly appreciative comments from various Members."
"As I see it, all the groups have worked together to put together a really outstanding document, not least considering the fact that some of them had been working towards this sort of report and constantly stressing the need for one long before I was elected to this House."
"The primary reason why this report is so much more urgently needed now than it was before has to do with the information age in which we are now living."
"It is worth bearing in mind that the total data stored by European authorities amounts, not to hundreds of thousands, or even to millions, but to billions of units of data touching upon the personality of every individual, in that the information stored could, with ill intent – which I am not, however, ascribing to any state – be brought together to compile profiles in order to find out what those citizens we disapprove of are getting up to."
"This report is made all the more urgently necessary by the prospect of these quantities of data increasing still further."
"Systems such as EURODAC and APIS exist already, but are yet to be implemented, and the visa information system is in the course of being developed."
"SIS – the second-generation Schengen information system – is in place, and there may well soon also be, in the third pillar, the storage and transfer of information on air passengers, and so these billions of data units will increase still further."
"To that one must add the Commission communication on interoperability and synergy and enhancing the efficiency of European databases, the effect of which in practice will be to connect these databases with one another, so that – once the technical problems have been overcome – the exchange of data will be made much simpler."
"The problem is, though, that the people who want to protect this data, are often depicted as a bunch of crackpots who are incapable of rationally balancing fundamental rights against the right to security."
"Thank heaven this House has not, in this instance, allowed itself to be pushed into this sort of corner and forced to play off fundamental rights against security, for what definitely does endanger public security is a reduction in fundamental rights."
"I am very grateful to Mrs Roure for saving us Liberals a great deal of work by incorporating an incredible number of amendments and proposals that originated from Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Commissioner, so that means that we are in full agreement."
"This House has but few swords to hand, and I think Mrs Roure has realised that, but the willingness, if need be, to halt the progress of SIS and VIS shows just how important this report is."
"."
"Mr President, like others before me, I would like to thank Mrs Roure very much on behalf of my group for the work that she has done on this report and the improvements we think have been brought to the initial proposal."
"I also welcome the Commissioner’s comments tonight in terms of his strong commitment to a rapid completion of the timetable for this framework decision."
"Parliament, like the Commission, also feels that as we move further down the road of data collection and data exchange, it is absolutely essential that we have safeguards in place."
"If more and more data is to be readily available on that principle – online and cross-border – we need those clear rules: not least for the agencies involved – they need to be clear about what it is they have and how it can be used – but equally, because people need to have confidence that this data will be used appropriately."
"They want to feel that it will be protected and not easily available to private parties."
"So we agree on the need for strict regulation and penal sanctions in that area."
"We are also clear – not least because of the recent issues about transfer of passenger data – that when we are handing data to third countries, when they are involved, we need clear safeguards as to where that data may end up and under what circumstances."
"We also welcome the fact that their data, too, will be assessed against fundamental rights."
"I think it is a tragedy that we have to think in those terms these days, but we do."
"Maybe what we are looking at here is a new definition of a ‘safe’ third country, at least in terms of its information."
"People also want to have confidence that data will be used appropriately and for the purpose for which it was collected, although we think it is totally appropriate that different categories of data, whether on suspects, convicted people, witnesses, victims, etc., are differently treated. Again, it gives clarity and facilitates communication."
"We also welcome the amendment stipulating that data relating to people not under suspicion should be used solely for the purpose collected."
"We hope that Member States would operate to that standard domestically, but I know of at least one where DNA data has been retained when it should not have been."
"So the additional safeguards concerning DNA and biometrics put into Article 6 are also very welcome to us."
"We need data we can trust – maybe that is something we cannot guarantee in a framework directive; but we also need to have confidence that the data collected is used appropriately and that rights are safeguarded while we are able to trace criminal activity more effectively."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in discussing the Roure report, we are debating a further measure in the interests of greater security for our citizens as the Hague Programme is realised, for which cooperation between police and justice authorities is needed."
"Such cooperation cannot be put in place unless the relevant information is exchanged and made available, but the whole scheme of things needs to be subject to appropriate control, and this is where the rapporteur deserves congratulation on having succeeded in striking the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the protection of personal data and hence of private life, and, on the other, the improved cooperation between police forces and justice authorities in the interests of public security, which is absolutely vital."
"There is no doubt that this report has also created the conditions for reflection on how data protection can be made more uniform throughout all our Member States."
"Thirdly, it also creates the conditions under which databases such as the Schengen information system and the visa information system – which will in future exist in a new form – can be used jointly and under which cross-connections can be established to the benefit of security."
"This report, then, endorses the principle of the interoperability of databases, and that is something I regard as a quite decisive quantum leap in terms of the European Union’s future security policy."
"This new security package, which we are discussing today in the context of the Hague Programme, will, however, be complete only as and when we have adopted the regulations on the visa information system and on Schengen II."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roure."
"However I also regret very strongly the absence of the Council tonight, because I am afraid too many of us are preaching to the converted: it is the Council that we have to convert."
"I want to add my voice to those who have emphasised how essential this measure is."
"That is why Parliament has been asking for it for many years."
"Now, however, in the era of all the EU databases such as the Visa Information System, the Schengen Information System, Eurodac and the whole question of access by law enforcement – the policy of interoperability – and, of course, the question of the transfer of data to third countries, including the air passenger data agreement, it is more vital than ever."
"It is a great mistake to think that data protection somehow obstructs police and security work: it actually enhances the prospect of cooperation by increasing trust and confidence, including public confidence."
"So I believe Parliament will do everything it can to achieve this measure."
"As the rapporteur on the Visa Information System, I see a triple package: the first-pillar regulation; the measure on access to the VIS for police and intelligence services; and this data protection framework decision."
"We have codecision on the first-pillar measure, so the message I want to send very strongly to the Council is that it needs to take account of that."
"I want the VIS to be on the statute book as soon as possible; but we need to have the other elements in place as well."
"– Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has long been seeking a new legal framework for data protection under the third pillar, comparable with the rules in force in Community law."
"We want to deliver the same level of protection, albeit taking account of the specific nature of police and legal work."
"We have to acknowledge that there is currently insufficient protection."
"The recent adoption of the proposed directive on retention of data was accompanied by a clear call for adequate guarantees to be adopted as part of this framework decision. As rapporteur on three legislative measures on the creation of the Schengen II information system, I sought to introduce the amendments needed to ensure the adoption of this framework decision."
"I also sent a letter to Mr Frattini, calling on the Commission to update the rules on data protection in the SIS II decision for the purposes of consistency. It is, after all, extremely important that the new laws apply both to SIS II and to the VIS."
"The resolution created by the judgment of the Court of Justice of 30 May, which overturned the decisions on the transfer of PNR data to the United States, will entail third pillar decisions, as Mr Frattini said last Monday."
"All of this reinforces the idea that it is of vital, pressing importance to adopt a legal instrument that ensures personal data protection outside the first pillar."
"Consequently, the adoption of this framework decision is both urgently needed and extremely important."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Roure on her report. I support the amendments that she tabled and that were adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Home Affairs."
"These proposals clarify the principles and guarantees that we would like to see safeguarded."
"I also support the rapporteur's request to postpone the vote on the final resolution until the next plenary session."
"Mr President, this framework decision is undoubtedly necessary."
"It is necessary in order to increase opportunities for cooperation between the judiciary in the Member States."
"It is also necessary because it will increase the scope of personal data protection, thus increasing the rights of private persons within the framework of third pillar cooperation."
"Following the terrorist attacks which shook our continent, we are aware how important such effective cooperation is."
"Unfortunately, there still seems to be a lack of mutual trust concerning cooperation between the judicial systems of Member States."
"In many cases this is justified, as the level of data protection often varies."
"However, if we want to build a common area of justice, freedom and security and achieve mutual recognition in future in terms of court rulings, decisions such as today’s framework decision are definitely necessary."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has tabled amendments to this draft which will certainly improve it and make it more precise, and bring it in line with what we already have in place concerning the protection of personal data under the first pillar."
"However, we should not forget two general issues when debating this matter."
"I hope, and this is the first problem, that personal data protection regulated by this framework decision will be in line with the data protection measures used when implementing the principle of accessibility within the framework of cooperation governed by the treaty signed in Prüm."
"On the other hand, I hope that adopting this instrument will mean that the European Union institutions will no longer have any reason to postpone the work on the VIS and SIS legislative package, as adoption of the latter is very much in the interests of the new Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0187/2006) by Mr Varvitsiotis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the European enforcement order and the transfer of sentenced persons between Member States of the EU [07307/2005 C6-0139/2005 2005/0805(CNS)]."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Varvitsiotis."
"I welcome this initiative from Austria, Finland and Sweden, which aims to apply the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving the privation of liberty, for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union."
"The initiative will facilitate the social rehabilitation of offenders."
"It should in fact allow for rehabilitation measures to be taken in the state of nationality or permanent legal residence."
"One of the most controversial issues to arise in the discussion of this proposal in Parliament and the Council is the issue of the consent of the offender."
"I generally agree with your view and that of the rapporteur."
"More precisely, I consider that consent is not necessary for transfer to a Member State to which the sentenced person is to be deported or transfer to the Member State of residence of the sentenced person."
"However, consent should be necessary for the transfer to the Member State of nationality of the sentenced person if that Member State is not the Member State of residence of the sentenced person."
"Finally, I fully subscribe to your amendment aimed at adding a provision that the victims of the crime shall also be informed."
"The Commission also considers it necessary that victims be informed, but only at their request, of the transfer of a sentenced person, because in this scenario the enforcement of any claims for damages becomes more complicated."
"I once again thank the rapporteur and can assure you that I will support most of your amendments during the discussions in the Council."
"Mr President, the question we are debating tonight is not new."
"It was first raised in March 1983 in the Council of Europe Convention, which all the Member States have ratified."
"This Convention made provision for sentenced persons to be transferred to serve the remainder of their sentence only to their state of nationality and only with their consent and that of the states involved."
"However, due to bureaucratic formalities, this system did not bring about any results, hence the need for the additional protocol of 18 December 1997, which did not require the sentenced person's consent."
"However, this protocol has not been ratified by all the Member States."
"This resulted in the initiative of Austria, Finland and Sweden, which aims to speed up the procedure in their Member State of origin or permanent residence."
"The transfer of sentenced persons to serve their sentence aims mainly to make their life easier in prison and to make their reintegration into society easier once they are released, because it is logical that a sentenced person in a prison in his state of nationality will find it easier to interact with other prisoners, to speak his own language and not just that: he will also be able to attend vocational training courses, which will contribute to his smooth reintegration into society, and it will be much easier for him to have contact with his family and friends."
"Support for his family will be an important element in this."
"Simplifying procedures, so that the transfer of sentenced persons is as flexible and with as little bureaucracy as possible, is our basic objective."
"I believe that what has been achieved is that the transfer criteria have been determined better, the principle of and the principle of specialty have been strengthened and the rights have been supported of victims, who must be informed about the whole procedure, including the order to transfer the sentenced person."
"I agree with the Commissioner, who says that victims should only be informed on request; however, in order for victims to know about this, they must first be told that such a procedure is under way."
"The proposal by the Member States refers only to 32 serious crimes and is based on a procedure for converting the sanction to another penalty which is compatible with the right of the executing state."
"These positions, as unanimously voted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, simplify and make more flexible the proposal by Austria, Finland and Sweden, which made provision for the Member States to permit the transit of a sentenced person on receipt of numerous documents."
"We also amended the deadlines set for each stage of the procedure, in order to make them more realistic and, at the same time, to allow a considerable period of time for the sentence to be served in the executing state, so that the reintegration procedure is more complete and more effective."
"We also regulated the issues of amnesties and pardons, which are raised following consultations between the issuing state and the executing state."
"I think that this proposal is another important step towards the convergence of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union, which is an ambitious objective, but an objective which we must bear in mind, so that we can, at some point, unify criminal law."
"Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups and everyone who tabled amendments for their excellent cooperation."
"I think that the Committee on Civil Liberties has taken a huge step in the direction of the unification of criminal law with this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my home country, Sweden, is one of the countries that has taken the initiative with this proposal."
"My party pushed this issue very hard in the election campaign."
"We are therefore very pleased and very grateful that it has now got to this stage."
"I would like to say a particularly warm thank you to Mr Varvitsiotis for his constructive work."
"In Sweden, we have a good deal of crime that is committed by people from across the Baltic Sea."
"For us, it seems quite reasonable for many of these criminals to be able to serve their sentences in their home countries."
"What is more, it is possible to observe that it can perhaps sometimes be more of a deterrent to apply this principle."
"In Sweden, we have discovered that our prisons are regarded as having a very strong international ‘force of attraction’."
"I think it reasonable for it to be possible for criminals to be transferred to the countries with which they have the strongest connections and for them then to serve their sentences there."
"The rapporteur developed this line of argument very well and also discussed the important social side of the issue, namely the family and social attachment, which is a strong and important argument."
"Since we are now developing the entire area of penal law and the police, we must, of course, ensure that we can transfer convicted criminals in a simple and less bureaucratic way."
"Quite simply, we need a flexible mechanism for carrying this out, something which this framework decision will certainly contribute to."
"The framework decision under discussion here also establishes the right of sentenced persons to state their opinion, which is of course important, while at the same time the criteria governing transfers are admirably robust."
"I would like to conclude by pointing out how unreasonable I believe it is that the Council is not represented here this evening."
"To neglect the debate in Parliament, which represents the interests of the people, when we are discussing such important issues rooted in an initiative from the Council itself I regard as an institutional affront, particularly when we are debating data protection issues, which are such a hot topic all over Europe."
"I deeply regret the fact that the Presidency is not present."
"."
"Mr President, with a view to fighting all kinds of crime in the European Union, we should promote mutual trust between national judicial authorities and strengthen the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters."
"The initiative by certain Member States aims to speed up the process for transferring persons sentenced in one Member State to another Member State of the European Union to which the person is in some way connected."
"For example, they may be a citizen of that country, have leave to remain there indefinitely or be closely linked to that country in terms of prison sentences, or other security measures, handed down to them."
"Moreover, the decision to transfer a sentenced person to another country to serve their punishment depends on the likelihood of better conditions being provided for their social rehabilitation."
"This is something that I would like to stress."
"However, we should pay close attention to the differences in the sentences meted out in different Member States."
"It is important to ensure that the sentences handed down in one Member State take account of the justice system implementing that sentence."
"The victim or the person harmed by the convicted person should be informed about the transfer of the sentenced person to another Member State."
"This was the position adopted by the Council in its framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings."
"Their equal treatment must be guaranteed, as must their dignity and right to participate in the trial, and account must be taken of their situation in the event of claims for damages."
"We should do all we can to ensure that the transfer procedure for sentenced persons is efficient, by getting rid of unnecessary red tape and creating a clearly defined, binding legal framework."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the very cooperative arrangements he established, which enabled our committee to arrive at its conclusions."
"Commissioner, I have a little story for you."
"Imagine two prisoners, both of whom are citizens of the same Member State and who are both in prison in another Member State."
"They have committed the same crime."
"They have received identical sentences."
"After several years, both are eligible for transfer back to their home Member State."
"One has behaved beautifully, has been a model prisoner, has repented, has learned and has changed, while the other has behaved very badly, is unreformed and needs more help."
"However, and this is the problem I want to draw your attention to, the information on the two prisoners cannot be transferred back across the borders with the prisoners, because present-day data privacy laws prevent the transfer of data across frontiers."
"This means that the receiving Member State has no idea as to which of the prisoners is a continuing threat, and which is safe to release back into society."
"Commissioner, could you please take action to ensure that the data can travel with the prisoners when we get to that stage?"
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to improve standards in the quality and efficiency of justice."
"This is a very sensitive area that varies appreciably across the Member States."
"Hence the need to strengthen mutual trust whereby legal decisions are mutually recognised."
"Confidence in the quality and efficiency of the legal system of other partners in the Union contributes towards the gradual development of a European legal culture."
"This framework-decision is a further step in this direction and will also help strengthen the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty."
"Speeding up the transfer of sentenced persons to another Member State of which they are nationals or to a particular State with which that person is linked in some way increases the potential to achieve social rehabilitation."
"I wish to commend Mr Varvitsiotis on his report and on the excellent proposals that he submitted to us, which I support in full and which are worthy of the unanimous support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The sentenced person does need adequate guarantees such as a prior hearing before the sentence is delivered, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out."
"The principle of speciality, whereby the person is not tried for acts other than those for which he is serving his sentence, must also be upheld."
"The victims of sentenced persons must also be kept informed both of the existence of an application for the recognition and transfer of the sentence, and of the result of the trial and the nature of the transfer."
"I also agree that under no circumstances should it be possible to convert the sentence into a financial penalty or to increase the punishment imposed by the Member State in question."
"Mr President, under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which has been ratified by all the Member States, sentenced persons may be transferred, to serve the balance of their sentences, under three conditions: to their state of nationality, with their consent and with that of the states involved."
"The current initiative differs in that it provides a fast-track mechanism for the recognition and enforcement by a Member State of sentences involving deprivation of freedom or security measures imposed on that person by a court of another Member State."
"According to the text, the person has to be a national of that Member State, be legally resident there, or have close links with it."
"There is a need for some form of clarification, and for the criteria to be made more distinct, in the sense that, at least as laid down in the text, there is not always a clear distinction between nationals, legal residence and close links."
"There is also a need to further clarify what is meant by ‘close links’."
"To conclude, may I refer briefly to a scenario in which the transfer of a sentenced person is to be recommend for humanitarian reasons relating to that person’s family."
"I was recently approached to evaluate the possibility of whether Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, who is serving a sentence in Scotland for the Lockerbie tragedy, could serve his sentence in Malta."
"In this scenario, that would only be possible if the criteria were distinct and the concept of ‘close links’ were interpreted very broadly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0124/2006) by Mrs Brepoels, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction [COM(2005)0399 C6-0256/2005 2005/0166(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important this evening that we are having a debate on the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon."
"This is a successful European agency, which has shown itself to be particularly effective at implementing our European strategy for preventing and combating drug addiction."
"I should just like to mention a few figures on drug-taking in Europe, which I find quite shocking."
"These are data from the Lisbon monitoring centre itself."
"Every month, 1.5 million European citizens use cocaine, 9.5 million use cannabis, and 3 million use this drug on a more or less habitual basis, meaning every day."
"Moreover, the use of mixtures of drugs, often taken with alcohol, is rising sharply."
"Lastly, the use of ecstasy has also increased, and sadly it is being produced more and more often in Europe."
"There are over 1 million Europeans who use ecstasy on a regular basis."
"I am pleased to note that this proposal is based on Article 152 of the Treaty, which allows Parliament to play a full role in this area."
"I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for her report, which I consider important and well-balanced, and for her efforts to reach an agreement on the Commission proposal at first reading under the codecision procedure."
"I believe that the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur will be accepted, thus making it possible to bring this report to a successful conclusion."
"I can say in advance that I agree with most of the amendments, with a few exceptions that I should like to mention quickly."
"I am worried about Amendments 8, 15, 18 and 32 to 39."
"I shall just make a brief comment on Amendment 15, which provides for the European Parliament to issue an opinion on the centre’s three-year programme of work."
"The interinstitutional agreement gives Parliament a legislative role and not an executive role, and so I think that issuing an opinion or approving the programme of work of an executive centre would mean departing from Parliament’s role of political control."
"Amendment 18 concerns an issue that is subject to the Commission’s horizontal competence, relating to the regulation of some 18 European agencies."
"This amendment cannot be accepted, not on questions of merit, but because political agreement is currently being sought on the horizontal proposal."
"Lastly, Amendments 32 to 39 make me hesitate because they seem to have no bearing on the compromise that has been reached among the three institutions, in that they would give the Lisbon centre a practical evaluation role, which I think is frankly alien to the actual role of the Lisbon centre."
"The main purpose of this centre is to provide instruments to facilitate evaluation and monitoring by the Member States and the Commission."
"Consequently, I think it would be inadvisable to give the centre an autonomous evaluation role."
"Apart from these objections, I support both the report and the rapporteur’s amendments."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the proposal we are discussing here today has been around for some time, for the legal discussion goes back to late 2003 when the Commission submitted its initial proposal."
"Parliament subsequently issued an opinion in April 2004, whereupon, following discussions in the Council, it was decided to change the legal basis, whereupon the codecision procedure became applicable."
"This Commission proposal covers a number of aspects."
"In fact, it regulates the codification of three previous amendments, extends the Centre’s role and has made changes in line with the new European reality following the enlargement by the ten new countries."
"Accordingly, the Centre will in future focus more on new trends in the area of drug use, including the combination of legal and illegal psychoactive substances."
"In addition, the proposal also aims to introduce a few changes with a view to bringing the bodies of the Centre into line with everyday practice and, as I said, the EU’s enlargement."
"We are convinced that the proposed amendments are all changes that will benefit the Centre’s efficiency."
"Accordingly, it is true that we back the request for more objective and comparable data, for the executive bureau to be anchored in the Centre’s rules, for regular assessments of the Centre’s activities and also for the Reitox network of national focal points."
"Finally, we set great store by six-yearly external assessments."
"During the discussion in our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, a number of important points were added."
"Since the Centre’s principal role is collating and distributing information on drugs and drug use, Parliament believes that the exchange of information on best practices in tackling the drugs issue could add value to the Member States’ policy."
"With regard to the composition of the executive committee, it appears appropriate, alongside the chairman and vice chairman, to send another two members of the Management Board who represent the Member States, as well as two Committee representatives."
"In that case, of course, decisions need to be taken by consensus."
"It also strikes us as desirable that along with the Centre’s Director, the Centre’s Chairperson can also be heard by Parliament."
"We also take the view that far-reaching cooperation of national focal points with organisations that are active in this area allow for a prompt and adequate follow-up of the European drugs situation and enable the Member States to respond more adequately to new developments and phenomena involving drugs and drug use."
"The main points of discussion with the Council in this dossier concerned the composition of the scientific committee and the procedure to appoint the Director."
"Indeed, the scientific committee is tasked to issue advice about scientific issues regarding the Centre's activities."
"Parliament takes the view that this committee must be restricted to no more than 15 members who are selected on the basis of their expertise via an open procedure, rather than on the basis of where they come from, namely one representative from each Member State, as had been the case in the past."
"Since at the moment, as the Commissioner already stated, a proposal applicable to all agencies is pending in respect of the procedure for the appointment of the Director and the extension of his mandate, it was decided to revisit the provisions of the regulation establishing the Centre and await the outcome of these negotiations."
"Since the start of the discussion of this dossier, it has indeed always been our intention to reach agreement between the three institutions, hence also with the Council and the Commission, at first reading."
"I am delighted that, after much debating, we succeeded in this."
"After all, the proposed compromise contains nearly all Parliament’s proposals and we are therefore convinced that there is actually nothing that stands in the way of us reaching agreement or approving the same tomorrow."
"I would expressly thank the Austrian Presidency, but also the Commission and certainly also my shadow rapporteurs from all groups for the very constructive working relationship."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for the report that has been presented."
"We must all agree that the topic of drugs and drug dependency, not only in the Member States of the European Union but also across the wider world, is a delicate topic which has an enormous social and economic impact on society."
"Precisely for this reason, it is surely essential and highly desirable to have the closest possible cooperation between all interested sectors of society."
"Even though this aim is clearly stated and shared by all, it is very often difficult to agree on how to achieve it."
"I welcome the positive changes that appear in this report."
"First of all, I appreciate the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, specifically those relating to closer cooperation between the Member States of the Union."
"One example of this closer cooperation would be the task of the Centre to provide information on proven approaches, as well as assisting in and facilitating the exchange of information between Member States."
"It is accepted that drugs know no borders, and this surely applies doubly to the borders of the EU, whether internal or external."
"I regret that the proposal for intensive cooperation with non-EU Member States in suppressing the movement of drugs and the trade in drugs has not been included in the final report, despite the fact that it is precisely from these numerous non-Member States that the greatest volume of drugs flows into Europe."
"On the other hand, I welcome the inclusion of the proposal for exchanging data between the European Centre, the UN and the World Health Organisation, which will be an effective means for preventing duplication in data collection and ensuring easier processing."
"I also welcome the proposal to introduce active cooperation with Europol, which will be extremely helpful in fighting and suppressing the criminality that is linked to drugs."
"The proposal for the Centre to have a duty to provide information to Member States in respect of developments and new trends in drug use is certainly of key importance and will enable higher levels of preparedness and ability to respond on the part of the Member States."
"The cooperation between the Centre and the European Parliament, and the increased influence of Parliament, for example in developing a work plan for the Centre, filling the post of director and assessing the work of the Centre is in my view one further step towards the democratisation of European institutions and towards closer monitoring of the work of the European Centre in the future."
"I consider the report, as presented by the rapporteur, to be extremely well-balanced and I recommend that it be adopted."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, the first thing this report does is to endorse what is simply a technical necessity, that is to say, the adaptation of this drugs monitoring centre, but what I see as far more important is what the rapporteur does in the other part of the report, which addresses the issue of how the work of the Monitoring Centre on Drugs can be organised in a more efficient way."
"I do not think it is enough for a drugs monitoring centre to do no more that collect data and then publicise them every year in an illustrated document."
"There are many more possibilities, and this report, and the rapporteur’s proposals, go much further."
"What we need is for the data to be, at last, comparable; there needs to be more analysis of them, with the various drugs policies evaluated in order to make it possible for a recommendation to be made to the Member States on the basis of which strategies are successful and which are not."
"What is needed is more cooperation with other organisations, such as the World Health Organisation or the UN, in order, quite simply, to avoid overlaps and duplications, as well as cooperation with Europol in order to tie drugs offences in with the crimes with which they are associated."
"This report gives us a chance to extend the Drugs Monitoring Centre’s powers, at least to some degree, which is desirable if the monitoring centre is to carry more weight and offer our Member States real help in the fight against drugs."
"."
"Mr President, the work of the EMCDDA is, for me, one of the best examples of the EU having a common goal, a joint interest and an added value, because drugs and drug addiction have a damaging effect on society."
"They are a source not only of crime but also of social problems, instability and health hazards."
"The policies of various Member States vis-à-vis these problems vary greatly."
"I believe that it is in the interests of our citizens, especially the young ones, that we Europeans should be big enough to want to learn from one another, to want to ask, without any ideological bias, which policies are the most effective."
"Questions that we could have debated in this discussion about the EMCDDA are, for instance: what about the option to provide heroin under medical supervision to the group that is most heavily addicted?"
"Is that something that helps?"
"Is cannabis really not dangerous to the health of our citizens?"
"Have we ever really investigated this?"
"I am from a Member State that has chosen a somewhat peculiar policy on both of those issues."
"I would be one of the first to welcome a very thorough inquiry."
"I would also be one of the first to want to do away with those policies if they are not effective."
"We have not discussed any of that, unfortunately."
"We have discussed other things, such as how much influence the Member States will have on the Scientific Committee, how we are going to elect the chairperson of the Management Board, who gets to sit on the Management Board, and whether the European Parliament will have a say on the Executive Committee – not to be confused with the Management Board, which is something completely different."
"I want to thank the rapporteur, because she has managed to engage in this institutional debate without jeopardising the goal of the Centre, which is the benchmarking of various Member States’ policies – still very much in this report."
"I praise the EMCDDA for the work it has done so far, and wish it the best of luck in its work in future."
"."
"Mr President, I can be very brief, because most of what needed to be said has been said."
"I also wish to thank the rapporteur and express my admiration for all the work she has done on a dossier which has not been easy, for the reasons that have just been outlined by my colleague, Mrs Mastenbroek."
"This is an area which is very sensitive and very heavily charged with ideology and national traditions as well."
"The aim of the rapporteur to come to an agreement with the other institutions has our full support, and it has had the full support of all the groups from the very start."
"It has not been easy, because the text before us is a compromise."
"Let us accept that."
"Many people in my group would have liked to go much further, like many people in Mrs Mastenbroek’s group, but we have all had to swallow a little bit in order to achieve this compromise."
"One of the things we have achieved in this compromise that was very important to us was the independence of the monitoring centre and we all know that there were very strong pressures in order to put the Scientific Committee effectively under national control."
"However, we have managed to avoid that, and that is really an achievement worth supporting."
"I have been hesitating until the very end, but I can tell Mrs Brepoels that she has our support."
"However, in order to keep the compromise alive, we need the support of all the groups and, therefore, I am seeking clarification from the Socialist Group as to whether it will support the compromise, because it is essential to know that before we go to the vote."
"In any case, you can count on our support."
"."
"Mr President, as I have one minute to speak, I would simply like to draw your attention to the conclusions of the report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"It is regrettable that these conclusions have not been implemented."
"The values espoused by individuals and their behaviour are influenced by what the people in question view as the norm in their social environments."
"The second conclusion was that a monitoring policy has more influence on social norms than media campaigns and an educational approach."
"If young people in particular view experimenting with drugs as normal and socially acceptable, this is a key factor influencing their values and their behaviour concerning drug consumption."
"It is regrettable that such conclusions came at the cost of millions of drug addicts and the deaths of thousands of young people as a result of fatal, experimental liberalisation policies which divided drugs into soft drugs, which were supposedly harmless, and hard drugs."
"This policy continues to this day."
"Speaking of soft drugs as being safe is a very dangerous form of manipulation which facilitates dependency on drugs and the spread of drug addiction."
"– The problem of drug use, in particular cocaine, is on the increase, and the number of young people experimenting with drugs in Europe is also growing. This clearly demonstrates that much remains to be done in the fight against drugs."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has played an important role in compiling and publishing information on drugs and their use and has encouraged organisations in the Member States to communicate and exchange best practices."
"As Mr Pirker has pointed out, however, there need to be common criteria and standard data-collection methods, since that is the only way of ensuring that data relating to drug issues are objective, reliable and above all comparable."
"A solution needs to be found quickly to the problem of data being unavailable or hardly comparable in some Member States, which hampers general monitoring of the European drugs situation."
"I should like to commend Mrs Brepoels on this report and on the excellent outcome that she has achieved."
"We are adopting this proposed review of the regulation at the end of three years of negotiation, which primarily involves amending the originally agreed legal basis, putting Parliament in the position of co-legislator."
"I should like to express my satisfaction at the more prominent role given to the Monitoring Centre, which will take account of emerging trends in poly-drug use, including the combined use of licit and illicit psychoactive substances, and the move to adapt the operation of the Centre's bodies in order to take account of enlargement."
"Lastly, I should like to draw attention to the global nature of drug use, which means that we have to place European analysis in a broader context."
"It is also important to step up cooperation with non-EU countries, especially as many of the drugs that enter the EU do so from non-EU countries."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot fail to welcome your speech, Mr Frattini, because it has accurately highlighted how serious the drug problem is in the European Union."
"I agree with what Mr Coelho and Mr Pirker have said, because the fight against drug taking and trafficking has to be an ever increasing priority for the Union."
"It is in fact impossible to address this growing emergency, which has worldwide implications, without the involvement of all the supranational institutions and without constant updates on a situation that is changing all the time."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s proposal to strengthen the activities of the European Monitoring Centre, in order to make the exchange of information on the measures adopted by the various Member States increasingly effective and to achieve closer cooperation with Europol."
"The consumption of drugs and substances that create dependence varies over time."
"Whereas heroin used to cause the greatest alarm in the past, cocaine now prompts more concern because of the way it is spreading among young people, together with the lethal mixes with alcohol that are being used in clubs."
"Understanding what is changing in order to prevent and fight the drug problem more effectively is a criterion that we should apply when assessing the monitoring centre’s role."
"However, we have a duty in our anti-drug measures not to give in to the permissiveness that so far has only caused an increase in dependence."
"For example, it was unacceptable for an Italian Government representative to state that he favoured the possibility of controlled drug use through what are known as ‘injecting rooms’."
"Decisions of that kind have never given young people back their freedom."
"In that regard, I agree wholeheartedly with the words of Don Gelmini, a priest who is a leading international figure in the fight for the rehabilitation of drug addicts, who said that fighting drugs with drugs is an aberration; it is like reopening lunatic asylums to cure the mentally ill."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0189/2006) by Mrs Ždanoka, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all [2005/2191(INI)]."
"."
"Mr President, the report on the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, which has been adopted by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is a synthesis of the efforts of all those involved, including the representatives of all the large political groups."
"I am very grateful to my shadow rapporteurs, and to other colleagues, for their constructive suggestions."
"I hope that the proposals we have drawn up in the framework strategy for providing the equal and effective participation of all persons in the economic, social and political life of Europe will become the key factor to overcoming the recent negative tendencies which are undermining the prospects for the sustainable development of Europe in the 21st century."
"Ignorance of the multicultural and multiethnic nature of modern societies leads to dangerous social tensions."
"The ethnic, social and linguistic diversity of European society should be perceived not only as a challenge for sustainable development but also as a source of creative potential and for the dynamic stability of modern Europe."
"What are the key elements of the framework strategy?"
"Firstly, there are different ways of understanding the concept of discrimination, depending on whether it is viewed from an individual or collective point of view."
"At the same time, upholding the rights of citizens as individuals does not require the same action as upholding the interests of groups of individuals."
"We therefore stress the need to adopt specific measures intended to prevent or to compensate for the disadvantages linked to one of the grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty."
"Such measures should be extended to all sectors in which serious inequalities are found, whether in education, healthcare, housing, access to goods and services, or any other area."
"Secondly, the detection of indirect forms of discrimination must be based upon reliable statistics relating in particular to certain groups with special characteristics."
"There is no conflict between personal data protection and the monitoring of discrimination through statistical means, insofar as the objective of such monitoring is to gain a better understanding of the over- or under-representation of certain groups in particular sectors or at certain levels and to measure progress in order to identify the need to act and to select the most effective course of action."
"We also stress the need for supplementary legislation."
"We greatly regret the fact that, despite repeated requests from the European Parliament, the Commission does not intend at this stage to come forward with further legislative proposals based on Article 13."
"We insist that a new legislative tool, incorporating all the forms of discrimination set out in Article 13, and having the same scope as Directive 2000/43/EC, be submitted before mid-2007."
"We also call upon the Commission to take urgent action against Member States that have failed to transpose Community law prohibiting discrimination, considering that new Member States which have not transposed the anti-discrimination directives must be subject to infringement proceedings in the same way as the established Member States."
"We also ask Member States to take on obligations, without any reservations or restrictive declarations, under human rights treaties in the field of non-discrimination and the protection of persons belonging to minorities, as well as to honour such obligations in good faith."
"We consider that traditional national minorities urgently need to be protected by various forms of self-government or autonomy in order to overcome the double standards arising from the Copenhagen criteria, on the one hand, and the lack of any rules in the Member States, on the other."
"I am convinced that the European Union must in fact have one of the most advanced framework policies in the world for combating discrimination."
"."
"Mr President, Mrs Ždanoka, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Ždanoka, for an excellent report."
"We have an opportunity here to discuss a topic very close to my heart, which is the fight against discrimination and support for equal opportunities and diversity."
"The right of individuals to equality before the law and to protection from discrimination constitutes a basic right which is an essential precondition for the proper functioning of any democratic society, and we are all aware of how this right can help to increase economic and social cohesion in our countries and thereby also our prosperity."
"The goal of the Community is on the one hand to ensure the uniform application of the law in this area and on the other hand to back effective policies for fighting discrimination and upholding equality in cases where the law is not being applied in a satisfactory manner."
"As you yourselves have already emphasised, there are a whole range of structural obstacles preventing the achievement of a more just society."
"The aim of our initiative is therefore also to change attitudes and behaviour."
"I am pleased that your report to a great extent supports the approach taken by the Commission."
"I noticed that you drew attention to areas where progress was needed, and advanced some interesting suggestions as to how such progress might be achieved."
"Your report in the first place emphasises the importance of collecting data."
"A certain amount of progress is essential if we are to improve our understanding of discrimination, enabling us to propose effective measures and especially to monitor the way they are implemented."
"The Commission is pressing for this and at the same time taking steps to ensure that the law is enforced in the area of protecting personal data."
"As the Commission stated in its framework strategy, a handbook on the extent of discrimination will be issued at the end of 2006."
"A conceptual framework will also be developed soon for measuring progress in the fight against discrimination and evaluating the statistical data that are available both at a Community level and at a domestic level."
"There is, generally speaking, nothing in the Community’s legal basis to prevent the relevant data from being obtained."
"Your report also emphasised the need to reinforce positive measures in the fight against discrimination."
"The Commission greatly respects your comments and has already requested a group of its legal experts to draw up a paper on the positive measures currently being applied in the Member States."
"The report also stressed the importance of multiple discrimination, and with good reason."
"This topic deserves greater attention."
"We very often underestimate the number of people that are exposed to it."
"For this reason I have requested that a study be produced, the aim of which will be to improve understanding of the causes and consequences of multiple discrimination."
"There promises to be a major boost for our anti-discrimination policy from the forthcoming European Year of Equal Opportunities."
"I hope that by the end of 2007 more European citizens will understand the social and economic benefits that diversity can bring to us, and that they will be more aware of what rights they have."
"Finally, your report requested that a new legal instrument be put forward which would cover all of the reasons for discrimination, as mentioned in the framework strategy passed in June last year."
"The Commission has begun a far-reaching study into the suitability and operability of the new measures which are intended to supplement the existing legal framework."
"Until we have the results of this study the Commission will direct all of its energies towards monitoring the implementation of existing directives by the Member States, in the interests of the highest possible levels of justice."
"In this context the Commission will of course take all the necessary legal steps that the situation demands."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to your debate with interest."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the subjects discussed in Mrs Zdanoka’s report are important and commendable; however, as regards the content of the report, there are a number of questions and objections."
"Firstly, I would like to ask why the report selectively highlights only two groups in society, namely migrating Roma and non-citizens, as groups which may be experiencing unfavourable conditions and which should be paid special attention to."
"Yet refugees, asylum seekers and citizens of third countries who are arriving in Europe in increasing numbers are not mentioned as experiencing difficult conditions, and there is also no mention of their integration as being a matter of concern."
"Secondly, I cannot agree with the proposition in point 11 of the report to the effect that migrating Roma and non-citizens should be initially involved in elections at all levels without first ensuring that these residents have been integrated into society."
"This idea runs contrary to the historic experience of Europe and European values."
"I would also like to ask another question: were those Moslem youths who burned cars and vandalised shops in Paris last autumn not French citizens?"
"The majority of them were, but can we put our hands on our hearts and say that they were integrated into that society and shared its values?"
"As a result, it seems to me that Mrs Zdanoka’s report puts the emphasis on the wrong aspects, and therefore is misdirected and biased."
"Mr President, Mrs Ždanoka has produced a report that has one very important underlying idea, which is that effective action to combat discrimination is not easy, but that it is vital for governments, public authorities and multinational companies to take effective action to combat such discrimination."
"It is not an easy option, as we heard from the last speaker, as it causes controversy, but it is absolutely critical."
"As the Commissioner said, in order for the year of Equal Opportunities 2007 to mean something – I know he and his staff are working hard on it – we need to make proper advances."
"Mrs Ždanoka’s report does that. It is another step forward."
"She talks about active intervention and positive action."
"Positive action is one of the most misunderstood concepts."
"What positive action means is not necessarily affirmative action giving unfair advantages, but action to remove the barriers which cause discrimination."
"It is sad to see that ethnic monitoring still meets with such controversy and resistance in the European Union."
"It is now commonplace in the United Kingdom, and in multinational companies with operations in the United States and across Europe, to ethnically monitor their staff or to monitor them on the basis of disability or age."
"Why?"
"Because this enables one to understand which people are being promoted and retained in employment and whether there is indirect discrimination."
"The whole concept of indirect discrimination is being misunderstood and it is important for this concept to be advanced in reports like that by Mrs Ždanoka, because it works."
"If one looks at the institutions present here today – the Commission, Parliament and Council – where there is no ethnic monitoring, one can see what is happening."
"There are very few people who are non-white employed in those institutions, including in Parliament."
"My presence makes the percentage slightly higher today, but that is because the Chamber is empty."
"Article 13 contains an important concept."
"I know the Commissioner’s heart is in progressing Article 13, but what Mrs Ždanoka’s report states, very importantly, is that we need comprehensive legislation and we need to implement the Racial Equality Directive and Employment Directive and make them mean something, rather than leave them unimplemented."
"It is the same with the Framework Decision on Racist Offences, for which the Council has a responsibility."
"Finally, in answer to the last speaker and regarding the concerns over paragraph 11, I should say that the effective participation of minorities in public and political life is a precondition for good integration."
"It is important."
"Just two categories have been mentioned, but there are many other categories in many other countries where people can enjoy effective participation."
"We cannot ignore this issue."
"We must pay attention to it and we must take it forward."
"Overall, this report advances what I think should be a comprehensive Year of Equal Opportunities."
"We back the Commissioner in the strong action that I hope he will take in 2007."
"I want to thank Mrs Ždanoka for an excellent report, to which the Socialist Group will give its full support."
"."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we are discussing the excellent report by Mrs Ždanoka tonight, but I should like to remind you that tomorrow, unfortunately, we will be discussing a resolution on rampant racism and homophobic violence in Europe."
"Between the Ždanoka report and tomorrow’s resolution, we become painfully aware that there is still a lot to be achieved."
"Therefore I should like to make a proposal to the Commissioner."
"We have been talking a lot about anti-discrimination measures – and there are lots of very concrete proposals in the Ždanoka report."
"When I was preparing my remarks tonight I thought back to March 2000, when the political leaders of Europe launched a very ambitious strategy to make Europe the strongest sustainable knowledge-based economy in the world."
"They were very ambitious."
"Perhaps they over-reached a little bit, but ambition is a good thing."
"Why can we not be equally ambitious in the fight against discrimination and in the promotion of fundamental rights and equality in the European Union?"
"Those are, after all, our shared values."
"What we need here is not just one measure and then another, but a comprehensive and, most of all, very ambitious strategy."
"We need a roadmap and we need to put fundamental rights and equality at the heart of European policies."
"I would like to remind you that about a year and a half ago this House gave its confidence to President Barroso and his Commission, because he promised us that fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination would be top priority; it would be the cornerstone of the European Commission’s policies."
"I know that the Commissioner is personally very committed to that, but I have to say that, on the whole, the track record of the European Union in the last couple of years has not been very impressive."
"I know that the biggest stumbling-block is the Member States."
"The speed with which they adopt measures, security measures, for example, on data retention or PNR data, is remarkable."
"They manage to take decisions within three or four months."
"But when it comes to the framework decision against racism and xenophobia, they have still not reached agreement after five years!"
"That is an absolute disgrace."
"I call on the Commission to form an alliance with the European Parliament and come forward with a roadmap for fundamental rights and equality, based on the proposals in the Ždanoka report."
"We urgently need concrete measures."
"We need legislation."
"It is all very well to have awareness campaigns, but people who are discriminated against need a legal tool so that they can go to court."
"We need this framework decision."
"We need a mechanism to monitor the fundamental rights situation in the Member State."
"All of that we would qualify as better lawmaking."
"That is also in Mrs Ždanoka’s report."
"Better lawmaking is not just about repealing legislative proposals in the internal market policies; it is also about proposing things that are good for the citizen – something that Parliament has been calling for consistently."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights needs to become legally binding if it is to have any meaning."
"With regard to the European Year of Equal Opportunities, it is wonderful that we pay lip service to equal opportunities but, frankly, the budget allocated for the year is pathetic."
"If that is any indication of the importance that the Member States give to equal opportunities, we still have a long way to go."
"I am counting on the Commission’s cooperation with the European Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report, coming, I would remind other Members, from the committee and not simply from one individual."
"So I think the questions that were asked should be addressed to the committee as a whole."
"It was their choice as to which groups they particularly wanted to focus on, and they could have added many other amendments had they chosen to."
"We have legislation which already covers the vast majority of groups within the European Union."
"As others have said so eloquently this evening, we do not use it."
"But this inclusive approach coming from the idea of non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all is, I think, extremely important."
"As people have said, it is about fundamental rights, the dignity of the individual, the respect with which each individual should be treated, and the right of individuals to participate in society."
"There seems to be a huge expectation that individuals should be participating in society."
"They need the tools to be able to do that, they need to be included, and that includes, in my group’s belief, the right to political participation as well."
"As others have said, it is socially important: social cohesion is one of the aims of the Lisbon Agenda."
"It is part of the European treaties, it is an important thing we are looking at, and that society needs all the talents and all the skills that we can bring. It is not often that I quote business, but business will tell you it makes good business sense in a diverse society and a globalising world to have a workforce which is diverse and which includes all the talents."
"As the report so eloquently says, we need to use and extend the good practice we have."
"The European Union has invested heavily – not as heavily as some of us would like – for example in the Equal Programme, which brings many important lessons, not least from the asylum-seeker strand, in terms of preparation for work, language acquisition, a whole list of things we are talking about in terms of integration."
"We need to disseminate such results and exchange good practice."
"Many NGOs would be willing to share their experience, but they need the necessary network and support to do this."
"That could be one of the outcomes of the Year of Equal Opportunities for next year, and maybe Member States would like to invest even more in that."
"As we know, there are still far too many people suffering discrimination, and the full implementation of the Article 13 directives becomes urgent, as does the setting-up of national anti-discrimination agencies that have proved their worth, not least, for example, the Irish Human Rights Agency."
"And we need data."
"It is not discriminatory, in order to collect data, to see whether our policies are changing situations, or whether we are simply working on the basis of our personal beliefs and prejudices, rather than sound statistics and information."
"Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, in Parliament, we very often talk – and quite rightly so – about non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all."
"I welcome both the debate and this report."
"I can only hope that the Member States implement practical measures and that the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a success, so that we are able to achieve a society that really is for all, irrespective of disability, gender, ethnic background, sexual orientation and so on. In this area, we need to cooperate with voluntary organisations and make use of the knowledge that they have to offer."
"The fact that various forms of discrimination are often debated here in Parliament is due, I believe, to the fact that such issues are very important and complicated, but perhaps it shows, above all, the very large amount there is still to do."
"However, I have one more observation to make, and that is that it is never the groups that are actually discriminated against who get the opportunity to put forward their views."
"I therefore ask myself how many members of this Parliament, or of the national parliaments, are, for example, disabled, members of a minority group or from different ethnic backgrounds."
"Most of us belong to that population in the Member States that sets the norm."
"As long as this continues to be the case in political assemblies, industry and training, as well as socially and economically, I believe that special measures must be implemented."
"It is my view that discrimination has continued, all along, despite all the talk of change."
"If we are to change this situation, we must be able to apply positive discrimination."
"At present, we actually apply the opposite of such a policy – what might be called ‘negative discrimination’ – which means that disabled people, minority groups and women have to be better, more capable and everything else if they are to compete with the groups that set the norm."
"It is absolutely not a question of equal conditions applying."
"The situation is contrary to democracy, whereby everyone is supposed to have equal opportunities."
"I therefore advocate quotas as a means of changing this situation."
"Commissioner, colleagues, a few observations regarding inaccuracies in the report."
"The report calls for favourable measures to be adopted with regard to non-citizens whose rights are supposedly being infringed."
"There is a paragraph calling for guaranteeing and expanding voting rights at all election levels for Roma and non-citizens only."
"I agree that Roma are experiencing unfavourable conditions in many parts of Europe, but there is no reason to single out non-citizens."
"It is also unclear why the rapporteur is concerned about the social and political rights of only these two groups."
"It is surprising that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has not recognised the inherent bias in this report."
"It has even ignored the report’s discriminatory nature, as it makes no mention of migrants of any origin, third country citizens or religious minorities."
"And now about the true situation of non-citizens."
"The annual statistical report of the Secretariat of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, released a few days ago on 9 June, noted that, compared to other groups, non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia are a privileged category of people who enjoy rights and protection similar to those of citizens."
"Furthermore, special reference is made to the effect that the provisions of the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons cannot be applied to Latvian non-citizens."
"This is in contrast to the false claim made in Section K of the report that non-citizens are denied rights and that their rights are being infringed."
"I would like to ask: which rights are being infringed?"
"Does this group of residents not enjoy rights to education, housing, and access to goods and services?"
"Non-citizens in Latvia have all these rights."
"This group not only enjoys these rights, but also has the opportunity to obtain Latvian citizenship in Latvia and Estonian citizenship in Estonia, thereby being guaranteed political and social rights."
"Therefore, the absence of citizenship is a question of will and attitude among the non-citizens living in these countries."
"It would be strange, even absurd, if the European Parliament, when voting on rapporteur Zdanoka’s report, accepted her unjustified exaggerations, which do not reflect the true situation."
"I invite Members to assess the above-mentioned circumstances carefully, and to amend the biased and even false sections of the report."
"Mr President, the framework strategy for non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all applies to various fields of action."
"It seems that, in view of social consequences, the strategy mainly applies to young people."
"Lack of access to schooling and difficulties encountered by young people with regard to assimilation of the curriculum and finding a career reduce their chances of success in life from the outset."
"This is particularly the case in disadvantaged groups, ethnic groups and national minorities."
"In these cases, the actions of local governments, social organisations and the state are extremely important."
"I can give you an example of how to deal with these problems in the form of action taken in New Zealand."
"Maori children were significantly underachieving at school."
"As a result, the authorities began to analyse the reasons behind the problem, namely whether the teachers or the school were at fault or whether the children themselves lacked talent."
"A research team was set up to find answers to these questions."
"It turned out that the children were talented but that their mentality and traditions called for a modified style of teaching."
"The necessary changes were made, thus giving them equal opportunities within society"
"Action must be taken in the European Union to create adequate learning conditions for Roma children."
"Special attention must be paid to young people from disadvantaged families whose learning or career opportunities, as well as the likelihood of escaping their environment, are very limited."
"Educating and preparing disabled children for a career and for their future life is also problematic, as their situation depends, to a great extent, on the financial status of their parents and the society in which they live as well as on the job market."
"The problem is serious and requires specific assistance from the government, local authorities and social organisations, and support for the poorest regions of the EU in particular."
"It is especially difficult to create opportunities for children who, as well as having a disability, come from disadvantaged backgrounds or ethnic groups."
"Within the framework of measures to support this group, special conditions should be created for these children."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ždanoka, for drawing up a much-needed document."
"Mr President, the fight against discrimination must be fought daily; this is clear, not only from the report of Mrs Ždanoka, but also from our debate here in this House."
"I would like to emphasise one of the issues mentioned in the report: the protection of the rights of national minorities."
"The situation of national and ethnic minorities in both old and new Member States is rarely problem-free, and they are often facing direct, as well as indirect discrimination."
"It is clear that the prohibition of discrimination is not sufficient to resolve this issue."
"The creation of equal opportunities requires positive measures, as well, especially in order to combat indirect discrimination."
"I am convinced that the Commission could encourage the Member States whose legislative environment does not allow them to change this situation."
"New legal instruments are also required, as Mrs Ždanoka has pointed out, so that we can put an end to the unacceptable policy of double standards, because while the Copenhagen criteria regarding compliance with minority rights are applicable to candidate states, Member States do not have internal laws in this respect."
"I think that this situation is truly untenable."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Ždanoka, the rapporteur."
"This is a particularly important report."
"We have to clarify certain important concepts, because there are still many contradictions between the two European Union Directives."
"There are further, numerous contradictions regarding the relationship between anti-discrimination and equal treatment, as well, because we do know that they mean different things."
"My colleague Claude Moraes has already mentioned the need for positive action today."
"But we have not yet clarified the concept of positive discrimination, that is, the relationship and connection between equal treatment and preferential treatment, because if we apply the same standards to unequal groups, this will only create further inequality."
"Therefore we need positive actions, positive discrimination and preferential treatment, to enable us to counterbalance unequal opportunities in society."
"Another extremely important point is that discrimination never affects individuals."
"Those affected are not discriminated against because of their personality, but because they are old, they are women, they live with a disability, they belong to a sexual minority or to a traditional or new national minority."
"Therefore efficient protection requires more than just the protection of individuals: we need to protect entire groups."
"One of the greatest merits of this report is the protection of traditional historical minorities, which are entitled to political participation, autonomy and self-governance."
"The European Union does not have a minority protection system in place at this time, even though one in seven European citizens belongs to a traditional national minority."
"And finally, as regards the debate: the Roma and those without citizenship must be given increased protection, as a minority within minorities, and it is a shame that in several Member States there are several hundreds of thousands of people without citizenship."
"This situation must be remedied, and Commissioner Špidla deserves our thanks for wishing to move forward in combating discrimination."
"Mr President, I would like to call attention to an essential problem, which may have caused serious concerns to the rapporteur, who has indeed been very successful in including in the report certain issues and concepts with the emphasis they deserve."
"Such issues are, for instance, positive discrimination, and as regards traditional minorities, the issues of autonomy, self-governance and political presence."
"However, I want to call attention to a very important phenomenon: unfortunately, under the general policy of prohibiting discrimination, we cannot find solutions for all minorities in different life situations."
"If we are really looking for solutions and not just for window-dressing measures, it is very important to address the concerns specific to each minority seriously."
"I would like to stress that we must differentiate between traditional and new minorities, sexual minorities and other minorities."
"If we do not clarify these concepts and Community problems – each of which are considerable in themselves, and require serious measures at Community level – then we are not contributing to finding a solution, but to the creation of conceptual confusion and misleading issues."
"– The report encourages the complete eradication of discrimination on grounds of nationality or origin, restrictions on minorities or non-citizens and inequality in the areas of education, health and living standards within the European Union as soon as possible."
"The Commission ought to take action against states, which are unable to implement EU anti-discrimination legislation."
"Europe's movement forward will be smoother if people, who do not have EU citizenship, integrate into European society."
"They are very varied – emigrants from Islamic countries in France and other old EU countries, the Russian speaking minority in Latvia and Estonia."
"Lithuania does not have this problem, but we are more sensitive to our neighbours' situation than others."
"The demographic situation in the two countries mentioned is unique; it came about under particular conditions, which have not been experienced by either the old or the new EU Member States."
"Therefore, the progress of incorporating non-citizens into local communities must go hand in hand with their resolution to accept that they live in Latvia or Estonia, that they are becoming citizens of the European Union, and not some other union."
"While retaining their own distinctive culture, which makes Europe a richer place, they must respect their state, be proficient in its language and have the knowledge of its history and traditions."
"It is the duty of politicians to create the conditions appropriate for this."
"The ever increasing participation of non-citizens in elections is logical only if they participate constructively as well as more and more actively in the social and political life of their country."
"The report being considered makes an important encouragement for the states to establish institutions to fight discrimination."
"The statistical data being compiled by the Commission and national government institutions will help greatly to assess the damage caused by discrimination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although my political group does not share the same positions as the rapporteur, I should like to thank Mrs Ždanoka for her work and her contribution to this subject, which I hold dear."
"The rapporteur has demonstrated her desire to advance further in the collective and daily fight against discrimination."
"This political will is, in fact, crucial, and I should like to take advantage of this opportunity, once again, to remind the Council, which is still blocking the framework-decision against racism and xenophobia, that this interruption is altogether unacceptable."
"My group is not completely satisfied with the report: several paragraphs are long, unclear and the proposed definitions may give rise to misinterpretation."
"Two points trouble us in particular."
"Firstly, paragraph 11: my group cannot accept the rapporteur's proposal to grant migrants of Roma origin and non-citizens the right to vote in all elections, as that is going much too far."
"If migrants or non-citizens wish to participate in the life of the country in which they are settled, then they can quite simply request to become full citizens of that country, provided that the country helps them to gain access to citizenship."
"Secondly, paragraph 30: it is obviously crucial to treat all forms of discrimination on an equal footing."
"Combating homophobia in our societies is therefore of the utmost importance. That is why the first part of the paragraph concerned is entirely satisfactory, but we will not vote in favour of the second part calling for the principle of mutual recognition to be applied to same-sex marriages."
"We must respect the rules and the laws of the various Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the message that our Parliament must send out is clear: yes, we must respect each individual, and yes, we must promote tolerance, equal opportunities and diversity, but we must do so while respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, the report we are discussing this evening has significant implications for the citizens of the European Union, as it concerns the fight against all kinds of discrimination, which is something we still commonly encounter even now in the 21st century and in countries that are highly developed economically."
"The social and economic consequences of discrimination against citizens are very serious."
"This is why the fight against discrimination should be based on providing education in the broadest sense of the word at a very early age, and on effective information campaigns based on best practices."
"The Commission’s decision to declare 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities is a step in the right direction in the fight against discrimination."
"Let us hope that this will encourage protection of individual rights and an increased awareness of different forms of discrimination."
"However, the funds earmarked for the Year of Equal Opportunities are not sufficient to achieve the expected results."
"These actions should therefore also be continued in years to come."
"Member States should aim to guarantee equality, in terms of social and political rights, for everyone living in the European Union."
"Being different cannot be understood as being worse and therefore all citizens of the European Union should have the same right to a dignified life and equal opportunities for career development."
"That is why I strongly support Mrs Ždanoka’s report and congratulate her on a well-prepared document."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion which has just taken place and which clearly expressed the will of the European Parliament to back a series of measures in the area of equal opportunities, the fight against discrimination and the struggle for equal rights."
"You spoke from various standpoints, covering various aspects of this sustained effort from the European Union, which, as I have already stated in my introduction, is one of the foundation stones on which our Union is built."
"I hope you will allow me to comment very briefly on some of the points raised."
"Regarding the issue of positive measures, I feel that it is incorrect from any standpoint to talk about positive discrimination, since the measures discussed are really there to remove disadvantages and not to provide unfair advantages to anyone."
"European legislation facilitates such positive measures."
"We therefore decided through the medium of the work group to gather and assess examples of positive measures from individual Member States, and I think that this will prove to be of some importance."
"There was also mention of the important issue of data collection."
"I have already stated this in my introductory statement, but nevertheless I hope you will allow me to say it one more time."
"European legislation does not prevent collection of the relevant data."
"Data protection is naturally important from the viewpoint of the individual, but we can of course use duly and correctly processed anonymous data, so it is therefore a question of formulating the right methodologies."
"I mentioned the reports through which we would like to formulate a method for measuring equality of opportunity or, as the case may be, for assessing levels of equality of opportunity, and in this respect we do of course need the required statistical data."
"I think that it is consequently a question of the appropriate methodologies."
"As I have already said, there are no structural obstacles from the standpoint of European law."
"One important issue receiving a positive assessment was the year 2007."
"I think that this represents a real chance for assessing equality of opportunity from all possible viewpoints and for significantly raising the profile of our efforts, giving a very strong impulse for development in the years ahead."
"Concerning legislation – at present there are two basic directives in force, and these directives mark a very significant advance."
"I have to say that it is now apparent that precise and reliable implementation on the part of the Member States still has not been achieved in many cases, although Member States are clearly devoting considerable energy to getting the directives applied."
"The European Commission will therefore push for the use of all legal measures at its disposal because, as I have already stated, it is hugely important to apply these measures fairly so that they may bring about a real result."
"There is of course the open question of new legal instruments."
"As I have already mentioned, we are looking into this matter."
"In my view the clear principle applies that if legislation is necessary it should be introduced."
"On the other hand, however, it is always very important to assess whether the same effect might not be achieved through existing applicable instruments."
"We are considering the question of possible further legislation very seriously and we will produce our conclusions in 2007."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank you once again for the discussion and for the report."
"I do not know, of course, what will result from the report being debated and adopted by Parliament, but in any case the discussion that has taken place has been clear and rewarding, providing the Commission with a good guide for its future work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report of Mrs Ždanoka includes, among other things, several issues affecting the Roma, which are important for ensuring equal opportunities."
"I would like to talk about an area that is very important for the Roma community: statistical data collection."
"In view of historical and legal aspects, in Hungary it is very unpleasant to talk about the collection of ethnic data involving the Roma."
"In my opinion, the research of discrimination using statistical methods may provide data that may be useful to the Roma community, and obviously to other ethnic and minority groups, as well."
"These data are already available to us, albeit indirectly – for instance, in Hungary we can delimit the areas where the Roma live by examining the under-schooling indicators and the statistical figures of underdeveloped areas – and they may become statistical figures reflecting the efficiency of employment, housing and education programmes affecting the Roma."
"In this respect, statistical data may be used as evidence in the evaluation of the efficiency of initiatives."
"They may also become an excellent instrument in the fight to eliminate indirect discrimination, by presenting an authentic picture of, for instance, the extent to which a Member State has been able to apply the anti-discrimination directives transposed into its legal system."
"We must recognise the possibilities provided by monitoring, especially because the numerous available programmes of the last decade, aimed at helping to improve the quality of life of the Roma, have hardly made any changes in their situation."
"This was also due to the fact that we did not have an empirical method to prove the positive or negative outcome of the initiative."
"This excellent report has managed to present a comprehensive and detailed picture of the problems related to discrimination, mentioning painful areas and further actions to be taken."
"One of the most important instruments in the fight against discrimination is because learning may provide an opportunity for the disadvantaged to break out of their situation, and on the other hand, without an accepting, accommodating and respectful attitude, even the best-intended help offered by the majority society may have a destructive effect. have been created by equal treatment."
"Positive measures that facilitate a balanced representation in all areas of society are very important to those who suffer from cumulative disadvantages."
"I am glad that the report emphasises the necessity of regarding those in especially disadvantaged situations, such as the Roma, because the increasing exclusion of the Roma and their segregation in schools is typically a new Member State phenomenon."
"We welcome the fact that the regulation regarding the European Social Fund has become open to a wider social acceptance, including the financing of programmes facilitating tolerance and the social acceptance of minorities."
"However, positive legislation and the creation of programmes is only one side of the coin."
"An increased control of the adoption of European Union laws is required, to ensure that Member States are implementing them appropriately; on the other hand, such control would create a possibility for detecting efficiency and the necessity for any changes."
"The Fundamental Rights Agency could play a special role in this, but unfortunately the creation of the Agency has been postponed indefinitely, due to the disagreement of the Council."
"The report draws attention to the importance of fundamental European values and to the fact that they must be incorporated into the national laws of all Member States, and enforced."
"I believe that the 2007 Year of Equality should be publicised more widely than it has been so far."
"All European citizens should become aware that every person in Europe is entitled to freedom from discrimination and to equal opportunities."
"This means that citizens should be made aware of the relevant legislation and possibilities for legal redress."
"The dialogue between cultures is already needed in 2007, because it may be an instrument in the fight against discrimination, as well as an instrument for social integration and for strengthening European identity."
"Since discrimination is caused, to a large extent, by a lack of knowledge, we must start to address the problem in its early phase: it must be addressed in education, to ensure that children become aware of the importance of tolerance and diversity at an early age, and to ensure that tolerance and diversity become a value; fear of one another and the resulting aggression should not be allowed to become the characteristic feature of relations between cultures."
"I agree with the rapporteur as regards the necessity of additional legislation, and would I ask the Commission to fulfil actively its obligation as guardian of the Treaties, as described in paragraph 26 of the report, and to prepare comprehensive legislation as soon as possible in the area of combating discrimination."
"At the same time, I would also like to press for practical steps to be taken, and propose that within an open coordination system, Parliament, too, should call to account Member States in respect of concrete programmes for 2007-2008 and their results."
"I would also like to emphasise, separately, the importance of the media, and the possibilities it provides for combating discrimination, because our objective is to address as wide an audience as possible, and to ensure that our policy in this area becomes reliable."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council to take place in Brussels on 15 and 16 June, including the next steps in the period of reflection, and on the oral question to the Commission on the next steps in the period of reflection, by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (O-0033/2006 – B6-0208/2006)."
"For this purpose, Mr Winkler is here, on behalf of the Council, as is Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, accompanied by Mrs Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days’ – even hours’ – time, the Austrian Council Presidency will experience a high point in the shape of the European Council, which will give us the opportunity to address and discuss a whole range of issues to which our Presidency has been attending, and to lay down results."
"During the Austrian Presidency, a great many issues have been addressed, and a great many such issues and problems have been solved – very often together with you, the European Parliament."
"The topics for this European Council are very diverse, and so I shall have to confine myself to a brief outline of many of them."
"I am not claiming to cover everything, as I naturally wish to avoid encroaching too much on the speaking time of the Members of this House."
"The forthcoming Summit will be a working Summit."
"There are no epoch-making decisions on the agenda, but the Austrian Presidency’s harvest – where it has not already been brought in – will be just outside the barn door."
"The barn door is wide open, and now we want to bring the harvest in."
"In recent weeks and months, the Austrian Council Presidency has started work on a dual approach to bringing Europe forward – and this also applies to the forthcoming European Council."
"Firstly, this has involved addressing specific issues with the aim of making progress on the ones that are closest to the people: issues relating to prosperity, economic growth, job security, internal and external security, social security, energy security and much more."
"Secondly, this approach has involved reviving the continuous debate on the future of Europe."
"This dual approach combining specific issues with the future of Europe will also shape the agenda of the European Council."
"Therefore, the Council agenda will contain first and foremost a number of issues that all participants agree require European solutions. These are issues that present our societies and citizens with problems that, in a globalised world, cannot be sensibly addressed without a concerted effort from all the EU Member States and, I would add, by all the institutions of the EU."
"The first large group of issues concerns the area of security, freedom and justice."
"All the surveys on this, including the one by the Commission – and Commission Vice-President Wallström has also said this time and again – show that the public wants more Europe, expects more from Europe, in this particular field."
"In the last six months, a great deal of tangible progress has been achieved in this field: I shall make only brief mention of the counter-terrorism strategy, the enlargement of the Schengen area and the conclusion of visa facilitation and readmission agreements with various third countries."
"We have also invested a great deal of time and energy in a Strategy for the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs in the last six months – including making a start on developing a security belt, as it were, around the EU – and initiated a security partnership between the EU, our neighbouring countries, Russia and the United States."
"This Vienna Initiative, agreed at a tripartite Summit between the EU, Russia and the USA, will also be reflected in the conclusions of the European Council."
"Migration has been and remains a particularly important issue and will also be dealt with by the Council, on the basis of a number of specific cases."
"Time does not permit me to go into too much detail."
"This important issue warrants its own debate, where it would have to be examined from various points of view: not only from the point of view of the fight against illegal immigration and of judicial and police cooperation, but also from a development perspective."
"As the person responsible for development matters in the last six months, I can say that we have been doing considerable work on the issue of migration within the framework of the EU’s development strategy, too, and that this is an important approach that we must not forget, including in our public presentation of the problem."
"There is no doubt that individual measures will be of no avail in this regard: only an effective bundle of measures will help."
"Everything I have mentioned up to now is of course work in progress, and so the European Council is likely to invite the parties concerned to continue the momentum of work in all these fields."
"Europe should also bring greater security through its efforts to improve its emergency and crisis response capacities."
"Austria has been particularly committed to this in the months of its Presidency."
"The European Council will be presented with a report on this listing progress to date and making recommendations for further action."
"Former Commissioner and French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier has presented a very comprehensive, stimulating, forward-looking report, which will undoubtedly be examined closely by all the institutions of the EU in the coming weeks and months."
"It contains a number of good ideas for solving this problem to the benefit of public security."
"Another very important issue that cannot be sensibly solved without pan-European solutions is sustainable development."
"As we know, the EU has had a strategy on this since the Gothenburg European Council in 2001, whose objective is for all decisions to reflect the responsible management of natural resources."
"This guideline has now been completely renewed under the Austrian Presidency and further developed into an ambitious, comprehensive new strategy for a whole range of key fields such as climate change, clean energy, transport, and emphasis on sustainable consumption and production patterns."
"The issue of climate change, too, is on the agenda in this context."
"The issue of the Lisbon Strategy is, of course, another important topic for the European Council now to be held in Brussels."
"As Austrian Chancellor Schüssel also reported here, the European Council examined this strategy in detail back in March, and provided a good deal of specific guidance."
"Since then, success has been achieved in the form of two important milestones: the compromise on freedom to provide services, for which the Council owes Parliament a great debt of gratitude – I should like to make that absolutely clear and express my thanks to the House – and the agreement in principle on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"In the case of the Services Directive, the Council stayed as faithful as possible to Parliament’s compromise."
"This Directive is a good example of how the institutions of the EU, cooperating constructively and efficiently, can achieve tangible progress to the benefit of our citizens."
"The Austrian Presidency is particularly obliged to Parliament for this."
"It goes without saying that the issue of energy policy will be another important topic for the European Council."
"This issue has been examined and discussed on a large number of occasions, including in relation to third countries – and yesterday I had the opportunity to report to this House on the Summit with the Russian Federation."
"As regards the discussion within the Council, the main emphasis has been on the requisite internal measures, such as improving energy efficiency and moving over to renewable sources of energy."
"We now need to take external measures, too, and to this end we need a common, proactive approach that is properly thought out in geostrategic terms."
"On the instructions of the European Council, the Commission and Council Secretary-General Javier Solana have prepared a strategy paper that will be presented to the European Council."
"Another issue on which, according to surveys, the public expects more Europe is the issue of external policy, of the EU’s external relations."
"The majority of the European public wants the EU to play an important role on the international stage."
"In spite of the progress achieved in recent years – and I believe this to be considerable – the EU still does not have the weight befitting its economic power and its contribution to international trade."
"There remain a number of deficiencies to be remedied, and thanks are due to the Commission for preparing a concept paper on this, which makes a number of proposals."
"I am sure that the Commission President will also report on this."
"The issue of improving the functioning of the Union is also on the agenda of the European Council, of course."
"This rather grandiose title covers the efforts of the European Council to achieve tangible progress that is also measurable by individual citizens."
"This includes a number of initiatives that I should like to outline in brief."
"One initiative that is very important to the Austrian Council Presidency – and, I should add, to me personally – is the issue of transparency in the Council."
"These efforts are nothing new – progress has already been made in this direction – but the Austrian Council Presidency has attempted to find a global approach intended to create a new conscience about transparency, as it were."
"The core of this proposal consists in making the whole codecision procedure in all its stages open to the public."
"We believe that this is also a way of improving public confidence."
"We have not yet resolved all the reservations, but our Presidency is resolute in its intention to work towards this up to the last possible minute."
"Subsidiarity has been an important issue, as, in addition to a conscience about transparency, we undoubtedly need greater awareness of subsidiarity."
"I should like to make it absolutely clear – because I know that here in Parliament, in particular, scepticism is expressed time and again – that we are not talking here about a desire for re-nationalisation."
"I wish to make clear that our Presidency has been guided by a different objective."
"We are talking about helping to focus European action on the specific fields in which it is capable of producing added value."
"To this end, the Austrian Council Presidency organised a conference that was held in mid-April in St. Pölten, Austria, with the title ‘Europe begins at home’."
"This saw significant participation by Members of Parliament, of course, and you are familiar with the interesting proposals unveiled there."
"It is important to us that this issue now be a fixed item on the agenda and that it be borne in mind even more consciously than before."
"I shall mention only briefly the considerable progress we have managed to achieve – and I hope that this will indeed be the case – on the issue of comitology."
"This is about powers of scrutiny, it is about the Commission, Parliament and the Council interacting efficiently."
"If the proposal drawn up yesterday between the negotiators can now be pushed through – both in the Council and Parliament – we shall have achieved progress that, although on a rather dry issue, is nevertheless important for our cooperation."
"I should now like to move on to the last part of my speech: the future of Europe, the constitutional process, and the period of reflection."
"The period of reflection on which the European Council decided last June has meant that many Member States have taken more or less intensive initiatives to set in motion a real debate about the European project."
"The issue of European identity, too, has been examined from various starting points."
"I would remind the House of the ‘Sound of Europe’ conference at the start of the Austrian Presidency, and also of an event that, in my opinion, can definitely be called a success – the (European Café) event that was held at the same time in all the capitals on Europe Day."
"The Commission, too, has been very active, having developed its Plan D. I should like to express my particular thanks to Commission Vice-President Wallström for her constructive cooperation."
"We have had a good working relationship with the Commission, to the benefit of greater transparency and a better response to citizens’ demands and expectations."
"It has emerged that Member States would like to extend this period of reflection in one form or another by at least one year."
"The detailed arrangements and what should happen afterwards will be discussed intensively at the European Council and the relevant proposals made."
"Moving on to the subject of the Constitutional Treaty, we have succeeded in breaking the silence that reigned at first."
"It was not a foregone conclusion that this debate could be revived, but we worked hard at it and, in late May, succeeded in holding a discussion of this issue between Ministers for Foreign Affairs for the first time in more than a year."
"As one of the participants in this discussion, I can say that it was very open, wide-ranging and useful and did clarify the way forward on many points, even if no specific decisions were reached."
"It has become clear to all of us that the problems which the Constitutional Treaty is and has been intended to solve are still on the EU’s common agenda and that we must continue to pursue the constitutional project as a common European project."
"The discussion between Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Klosterneuburg also made clear that the time is not yet ripe for a definitive solution to the legal issues connected with the Constitutional Treaty, because not all Member States are ready as yet."
"Therefore, it will be a challenge for the whole of the Union and a particular challenge for the coming Presidencies to work to ensure that, by 2009, there is clarity regarding the legal basis of the EU of the future."
"After all, 2009 is a crucial year for various reasons: it will see not only a new European Parliament, but also one or two institutional challenges, such as a new composition of the Commission."
"It is not yet possible to determine the exact mandate the European Council will grant in this regard, whether a time frame will be fixed – and if so, what it will be – and how to proceed with regard to this; the Heads of State or Government will discuss and take decisions on this."
"I believe that that will certainly be one of the key topics at the forthcoming European Council."
"One thing is clear as far as the Austrian Council Presidency is concerned, however: we must work together with all the Member States and all the institutions to make progress on the key issues surrounding the future of the European Union."
"Finally, there is EU enlargement, another issue that will be given prominence at the European Council."
"I do not wish to go into detail on individual countries."
"You are familiar with the status of the respective negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, which – we all hope – will accede to the Union on 1 January 2007."
"You probably followed the progress made the day before yesterday at the accession conferences with Turkey and Croatia in the face of all the problems that had arisen in the case of Turkey, in particular."
"In Klosterneuburg, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs did succeed in reaching some agreement on further common action."
"The Heads of State or Government will continue this discussion and determine how to proceed in the coming months."
"It has emerged that, in the second half of this year, the Commission will be working out, among other things, a contribution to the debate on the European Union’s capacity to cope with enlargement – for which, as you know, there have been calls from Parliament, too."
"The conclusions of the European Council will mention the situation regarding the Western Balkans."
"As you know, this has been a particular priority for the Austrian Council Presidency."
"This issue is to be seen in the context of a policy of peace and stability in the Balkans."
"We shall be referring once more to the Salzburg Declaration by Ministers for Foreign Affairs and to the prospect of EU membership it holds out to the countries of the Western Balkans."
"A number of external –policy issues will be addressed at the European Council and declarations made on them: on the Western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and the Middle East, respectively; and the EU Strategy for Africa will also feature on the agenda."
"As you can see, there is an extensive menu in store for our Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission."
"I hope that you will agree that we have worked hard over the past months on making some progress on all of these important issues, and we hope that the European Council will succeed in rounding off several issues and stimulating such discussion of others as is necessary in the coming period in the interests of Europe and of our citizens."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the start of the period of reflection, it is time to take stock of matters."
"What stage are we at?"
"What can we do to move Europe forward?"
"What can one expect from the European Council?"
"I will begin by saying to you that a spectre haunts Europe: that of Euro-pessimism."
"While we already had the traditional Euroscepticism of those who have never wanted Europe to be a political project, we now have the pessimism of those who like to think of themselves as staunch Europeans and who very often sink into a state of ‘crisisphilia’, each one of them keen to demonstrate today that he or she has a better idea than the next person about the reasons why Europe is undergoing a profound crisis."
"What has caused this Euro-pessimism?"
"To a large extent, it has been the shadow cast by the 'No' votes in the referendums in two of our Member States."
"This shadow has raised doubts about Europe and about Europe’s ability to define a project for us to live together as Europeans."
"That is one of the reasons why we need to find a solution to the constitutional issue."
"I should like to make it perfectly clear: we, at the European Commission, are in favour of the principles, the values and the substance of the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is a question of knowing, firstly, why we need this constitutional text."
"What do we lose by not having a Constitutional Treaty?"
"We lose a clarification of the powers between the various levels, we lose an extension of the codecision procedure and an extension of qualified majority voting, we lose a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, we lose an EU Foreign Affairs Minister who would also act as the Vice-President of the Commission, and we lose more effective action in areas such as public health, food safety and even energy, because the Constitution was extending the powers in that area."
"We also lose an extra degree of consistency in external matters."
"On this point, I should like to say to you – and my one and a half year’s experience as President of the Commission confirms this – that we, in Europe, genuinely need what the Constitutional Treaty was providing us with externally: more effectiveness, more democracy and more consistency."
"The current Treaties do not allow us fully to achieve all of these objectives."
"Let us be clear, Nice is not enough."
"It is a question of knowing how to overcome this situation."
"Will we succeed in settling this problem by talking day in day out about the Constitution?"
"Will we succeed in settling this problem by restricting ourselves to a pragmatic approach?"
"I would say no; I would say that we need to avoid two traps."
"Firstly, the trap that consists in saying, as some people would have it, that the Constitution is dead and buried and that we should only do practical things: that would be dangerous for Europe."
"Moreover, it would also be dangerous for Europe, I should point out, if, at this point, we were to let ourselves get caught up in a purely institutional or constitutional debate, if we were to claim that we are being held up now while we await a solution to the constitutional issue."
"That is why we must progress on two levels, as is explained in our document of 10 May concerning the twin-track approach."
"The first level relates to a Europe of results, a Europe of practical projects, but – and we are coming to the second level – a Europe of results that is not in opposition, that is not an alternative, to political Europe, and that is, in contrast, a prerequisite for gaining the citizens' support for Europe as a great political project."
"Therefore, it is not about choosing between a Europe of results and an institutional Europe, it is about choosing them both."
"We need a Europe of projects and results if we are to have a great project for Europe."
"What is this Europe of results that is being proposed?"
"Despite everything, we have already achieved certain things."
"That is why I cannot agree with all those who say that Europe is at a complete standstill."
"I believe that, albeit unintentionally, they are compounding this crisis situation."
"I understand that it is the analysts’ job to say that Europe is at a standstill, but, as political leaders, we have a responsibility."
"Do you really believe that we are going to restore confidence among Europeans merely by sending out negative messages?"
"No."
"In order to move Europe forward, we must revive people's hopes, restore their confidence and demonstrate what progress has been made."
"The truth is that, even after the two ‘No’ votes in the referendums, we were able to settle the budgetary issue for the next seven years, and to do so for 27 countries."
"Thanks to the European Parliament’s contribution, we were able, despite everything, to find a political solution to the very controversial problem of the Services Directive."
"We were able, despite everything, to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment."
"We have launched a common energy strategy in Europe, something that was unthinkable two years ago."
"Let us therefore carry on making progress on the basis of practical projects."
"Let us achieve results so that we can create the right moment to deal with the institutional issue."
"In our document of 10 May, we make some practical proposals."
"Without wishing to go into the details of these proposals again, I shall point out a few of them. To see what is not working in the single market in order to protect consumers in Europe."
"To see what obstacles still stand in the way of fully completing the great European market. To review our social sphere: what are the obstacles to a more united Europe?"
"At the same time as making progress on the issue of the market, we must make progress on the social issue. On the basis of the existing Treaties, to make progress in relation to justice, cooperation and the fight against terrorism and crime."
"It is possible, on the basis of the current Treaties, to do more in terms of immigration and of the fight against illegal immigration, at the same time as dealing with issues concerning legal migration."
"This is a major issue."
"If the Member States want to do more, then they can do so on the very basis of the Treaties."
"Therefore, this is not simply an institutional matter, this is also a matter of political will."
"Let us therefore make progress in relation to justice and security."
"These are areas in which Europeans are calling on the Member States to do more, because it is obvious today that each one of us, on our own, cannot combat terrorism and cannot face up to the challenges of illegal migration: we must work together."
"A great deal more can be done, too, in relation to the external dimension."
"The right solution is the one included in the Constitution: a Foreign Affairs Minister, Vice-President of the Commission."
"We must pool our skills and our resources in external matters, but, in view of the fact that there is still no Constitution, the Commission presented a document a few days ago that contains practical proposals designed to increase the effectiveness, consistency and visibility of the European Union in external matters."
"Moreover, we have made some important proposals regarding subsidiarity, transparency and better regulation for Europe."
"We have there a series of practical projects, and that is without mentioning the two major areas that, in my opinion, will project Europe into the future: energy, following on from the Green Paper that we presented, and research."
"These are two key priorities."
"The truth is that our research budget will increase by 60% for the next seven years compared with the previous period."
"That is why we proposed to create a network-based European Institute of Technology, with a view to giving a European vocation to our research efforts and to attracting the best researchers in the world."
"Why are the best European researchers now based in the United States?"
"Why are we unable to attract the best Chinese, Indian, Latin American or American researchers here, to Europe?"
"We also need a symbolic project designed to harness our abilities in the field of research."
"Thus, let us rally around certain practical projects that can restore people’s confidence in Europe: this is the Europe of projects."
"The Europe of projects is not enough, however; we must settle the institutional matter too."
"What are we proposing on this issue?"
"We are proposing to move on now from the so-called period of reflection and enter into a commitment period."
"The first important stage is next year, when we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Community and the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome."
"I do not believe that the Heads of State or Government can let the 50th anniversary of our Union come and go without committing themselves to this project for living together as Europeans."
"There are two possibilities: either we make a declaration focused solely on the past, in other words a simple commemoration, or we make a declaration focused on the future, a way of renewing our commitment for the sake of our common project."
"As President of the Commission, I believe that I have the duty to ask the Heads of State or Government, who are the stakeholders of our projects, to renew their commitment."
"I believe that you too, as Members of the European Parliament, will have a right to ask our Heads of State or Government whether they wish to invest in this project for living together as Europeans, which is needed now more than ever in this globalised world."
"That is what we are going to do."
"That is why I have proposed a declaration that is not simply a new Messina Declaration."
"You will remember the Messina Declaration, following the failure of the project for a European Defence Community; that declaration made it possible to revive Europe and subsequently to create the European Economic Community."
"It was signed by the Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"That is no longer possible today."
"As I have already said: Europe will not be bureaucratic, technocratic or merely diplomatic;"
"Europe must be democratic."
"That is why all of Europe’s institutions must be involved and why I propose that this declaration be signed not only by the Heads of State or Government, but also by the Commission and by the European Parliament, which occupies a central position nowadays in the process of European integration."
"If we succeed in this undertaking, by putting all of our energy into it, we will have an opportunity next year to relaunch the European constitutional process and the process of building a Europe that is an enlarged Europe, and that involves a debate on enlargement."
"I do not believe in a miniature Europe, nor in a multi-speed, divided Europe."
"I do not believe that the response faced with the current situation and faced with the difficulties that Europe is encountering should be to say ‘let us divide up’."
"Are we going to let one or two countries create a more advanced Europe while letting the others lag behind?"
"I do not think so."
"I believe that it is our duty to do everything possible to make Europe, in its enlarged form, work."
"I say this to you in the light of some previous experience."
"If I compare the present situation with what was happening in 1992, for example, when negotiations were taking place with our US, Chinese, Russian and other partners, I can tell you that Europe is more respected outside its borders nowadays that it was previously."
"An enlarged Europe is a prerequisite for a powerful Europe."
"Let us hold a debate on enlargement."
"We recognise that some members of our public have doubts about the rate and the importance of enlargement."
"Let us hold a debate on the issue of absorption capacity, but let us do so by highlighting the added value that enlargement has already represented for Europe."
"That is the Europe that I so earnestly desire."
"An enlarged Europe, an open Europe, a more competitive Europe, a Europe that is much more than just a market, a Europe that has a political project, and a political project that is based on the idea of solidarity because, without solidarity, the very idea of a Union does not exist."
"That is the great project for the Europe of the 21st century."
"Not a closed Europe, nor a small, miniature Europe, but a great, enlarged Europe that is capable of shaping globalisation, instead of suffering the consequences of it."
"That is the great project for Europe."
"If it is to be achieved, it is vital that politicians emerge from the vicious circle of Euro-pessimism and can start to build the virtuous circle of trust, with practical results, of course, but also with this great vision of our great Europe."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have conveyed the good impression that the European Constitution is not dead but very much alive, and that there is the common will to bring this important European project to a successful conclusion."
"I believe that this Parliament can support wholeheartedly what we have heard."
"The Austrian Presidency has revived the constitutional debate."
"That is a good thing, and it has been hard work, but we can see that all parties are now back round the table and deliberating together how to proceed."
"I believe that many issues on the agenda at the Summit – from energy policy to development policy to the common foreign policy – and many other issues would be easier to resolve with the new Constitutional Treaty than with the old Treaty of Nice."
"For this reason, the constitutional debate we need is not an institutional, but an eminently political debate."
"We must also inform people of the costs of not having the Constitution."
"In our resolution, we ask the Commission President to present the people with a study showing everything we stand to lose by not having this new Treaty."
"This lunchtime, plenary will vote on a resolution containing a number of demands and also ideas for the next period of reflection and the further course of the constitutional process."
"The number one message to the Summit is that we once again need a declaration from all 25 Member States that they support this common project and are also willing to continue the ratification process."
"This declaration is necessary because other public statements have occasionally given the impression that the Member States concerned are distancing themselves from their commitments, and that would be a real crisis of confidence and a breakdown in loyalty among the Member States."
"I hope that the Summit can send out this message."
"The second point I should like to raise is that we would caution against breaking up this global compromise and cherry-picking or dismantling this Treaty."
"That would weaken the project of a political Europe and endanger cohesion."
"Thirdly, it is music to our ears that the Summit is to decide on a timetable."
"The EU has always been successful when it has been working towards a clear objective and a fixed date."
"That was the case with the internal market and with the euro, and must now also be the case with the Constitution."
"The dates 2007 and 2009 have been mentioned: these tally with those in our resolution, and we need this Treaty for the European elections."
"I would caution against going into the European elections with this crisis unresolved – that would strengthen Europe’s opponents and increase Euroscepticsm, perhaps even reduce voter turnout once again."
"We need to have succeeded by 2009."
"We believe that specific dialogue is needed with the two countries that voted ‘no’ in their referendums."
"It remains an open question how and under what circumstances these two countries could continue the ratification process."
"We cannot get around this point."
"The moment of truth will come following the elections in the Netherlands and France, if not sooner, and their partners need to know what the specific problem is with the Treaty."
"The ‘no’ was very vague, and it is not much use to us."
"We need a specific proposal for how we can help and what we should do."
"It is about time we saw a commitment to examining this issue more closely – it cannot be resolved by others; no one else can hold the debate in their place."
"The effort needs to come from the two countries themselves, but they do need to be asked."
"My next point is that the period of reflection is being extended, and indeed all parties should be committed to participating in this reflection."
"Some countries are still silent and are not becoming involved."
"That is bad for everyone, because these countries, too, still need to ratify the Constitution, and if the population does not know what it is letting itself in for and what is in store for it, that is bad for all the others."
"We believe that public involvement should be increased."
"Commissioner Wallström’s Plan D is good."
"We, too, must do our bit towards ensuring that even more money is made available."
"We simply need resources, and we also need cross-border projects rather than just national debates."
"We must continue to promote this element – from citizen to citizen, from Union citizen to Union citizen."
"We have had a very successful interparliamentary forum."
"This process requires the participation of not only the executive, but also the legislative bodies, the parliaments, and we, Parliament, are willing to continue this interparliamentary dialogue."
"It must be clear by the end of this debate that Europe is not just Brussels; Europe is all of us, wherever we live in our countries, regions and localities – and if we succeed in this, we have achieved real progress."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity, one year after the French and Dutch ‘No’ votes and only one day before the European Council, to answer Mr Leinen’s question."
"It also gives me the opportunity to outline the Commission’s position on the period of reflection and on the constitutional process."
"I partly replied to that question last month, when I presented this Chamber with the Commission’s two communications to the European Council – the assessment of the reflection period and Plan D – and the Citizens’ Agenda, to deliver results for Europe."
"As President Barroso has already outlined, we have set a Citizens’ Agenda with these concrete projects and the things we want to achieve."
"Before I come to the next steps to be taken, let me say this about the first steps."
"The Commission, as you have already heard, remains wholly committed to the principles, the values and the efficiency gains that the Constitutional Treaty would bring."
"We also welcome further ratifications, as from the Estonian Parliament recently, and as we have heard being announced from the incoming Finnish Presidency."
"I would also like to reply to Mr Leinen’s question and proposal to look at the effects of a ‘No’ to the Constitution or no Constitutional Treaty, and we are fully willing to do so."
"I think we should look at what would be the consequences and the costs of no Constitution at all."
"We cannot ignore the fact that right now we have no consensus, no common position among Member States on the fate of the Constitution and the institutional reform that we need so much."
"We cannot allow ourselves to be paralysed by this, and we are not doing so, as you have already heard."
"To begin with, the Commission intends to implement the ambitious policy-driven agenda to address citizens’ expectations and restore public confidence in the European project."
"After President Barroso’s outline, there can be no doubt about our determination."
"We shall deliver, and we will have to do that on the basis of the current treaties."
"We cannot afford to wait for what will shortly be 27 Member States to reach a consensus on the constitutional issue."
"At the same time, the Commission remains fully committed to debating and engaging in dialogue with citizens at European, national and regional levels."
"The methods we will use are set out in Plan D – as in Debate, Dialogue and Democracy."
"We should use that to explain the added value of the European project."
"We should use that to argue why we need a new Constitutional Treaty."
"We should use it to discuss the political priorities with citizens."
"Our two institutions may not always agree on every detail, but there is one fundamental belief that we share: our commitment to becoming a more democratic, transparent and effective Union."
"And that goes beyond any period of reflection."
"I also believe that European affairs suffer from a participatory deficit."
"Still, citizens have high expectations on delivery and policy content, and this places important demands on the Member States and on our institutions."
"We must involve citizens more in the policy process at all levels, particularly young people and women."
"Such initiatives should be concrete and seen as a permanent function of developing European affairs, and they should ensure that the feedback process is taken seriously – what do we do with what we hear in dialogue and engagement with citizens? – and that listening is followed up by concrete actions."
"I have said it before and I will say it again: Plan D is not a rescue operation for the Constitution."
"It is not limited to the reflection period – be it one year, two years or even more."
"It is a starting point for a long-term democratic reform process."
"We want to create a citizens’ ownership of EU policies to make them understandable and relevant, and to make EU institutions accountable to and reliable for those they serve."
"I see and hear of lot of nostalgic harking back to the good old days of the European Union, but nowadays it is no good having a few men shut themselves away in a castle somewhere trying to solve the problems of the European Union."
"Today we need to engage citizens; we need the support and trust of citizens and the confidence of citizens to be able to build a future for the European Union."
"We need to engage and create the participatory functioning of the EU institutions."
"As you pointed out in your motion for a resolution, we need a special focus in Plan D for the coming year, until the June 2007 Summit."
"I have already promised the Commission to come back after this Summit with a kind of mid-term review."
"I will pay close attention to the Summit’s conclusions in that review, and also to the resolution of this House."
"Delivering concrete results and reconnecting with European citizens will create the favourable climate that is necessary for successful institutional reforms; that is the way we motivate it."
"So far, Plan D has been a successful exercise in terms of setting off a wide range of activities, and I believe we have started to think and reason somewhat differently."
"We focus on what is our reality of today and for the future, how we need to interact with today’s and tomorrow’s citizens."
"Over 660 activities have been taking place in Member States; hundreds of thousands of citizens have visited the Europe debate website."
"For the future, I also think, as Mr Leinen does, that we need more of a citizen-to-citizen approach to allow citizens to meet across borders to discuss the European agenda."
"We should focus particularly on young people, the Europeans of tomorrow, and mobilise more women in the decision-making process."
"We need the whole of the European project to be more participatory, more transparent and more effective, and this ambition goes beyond any period of reflection."
"That is the only way we will be able to take the European Union into the future."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council spoke of a working Summit."
"After all, Europe will make progress only as a result of day-to-day efforts, of hard, specific work, and not as a result of brilliant feats of rhetoric – there is no shortage of soapbox speeches in Europe."
"I should like to wish the President-in-Office every success for the Summit."
"My particular thanks go out to the President of the Commission, however: not only for being here today – he could, of course, say that he is only present when the President of the European Council is here – but for what he has said today."
"After all, we recently heard great criticism of the Commission President by our esteemed fellow Member Mr Schulz and, as Mr Schulz is, of course, known for his objectivity, I am assuming he will be very complimentary about the Commission President’s speech in his own speech shortly."
"This dual path – defence of the principles of the substance of the European Constitution on the one hand and specific projects for taking Europe forward on the other – has our strong support."
"I wish to stress on behalf of our group that this has our emphatic support, and it would be good if the other group chairmen were to join me in stating that quite clearly."
"When we celebrate the anniversary of 25 March 1957 next year – on 25 March 2007 – our group will insist that this event not be a celebration of those Heads of State or Government who engage in mutual appreciation under or in front of pretty flags, but rather that it express Europe’s democracy, and that there be European Parliament involvement in the declaration and the establishment of our objectives for the 21st century."
"I am saying this for the benefit of the General Secretariat of the Council, as it does not actually tend to be the Heads of State or Government who obstruct things."
"I would call on the General Secretariat of the Council to give Parliament due involvement from the outset, as the Commission President has proposed – for which we should like to express our appreciation and thanks to him."
"My second comment concerns security in Europe."
"This, of course, is a delicate balancing act – on the one hand, there is the public’s need for protection against serious crime, against terrorism, against illegal immigration, and we expect specific measures to be taken on this, but, on the other hand, when it comes to immigration, we also expect respect for human dignity and a search for humane measures to deal with illegal immigration."
"We cannot accept the situation in which thousands of people are dying a wretched death in the Mediterranean and on the seas of this world, but instead must take specific measures on this, too – to prevent these human tragedies."
"A further point concerns the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the issue of the Services Directive, we have proved our good will, our capacity for action – and compliments to the Austrian Presidency for taking this path."
"We are in favour of a European Institute of Technology – provided that it creates a network rather than new bureaucracy."
"As regards energy supply, we are in favour of diversity: diversity with regard to energy sources – we cannot rely on just one form of energy, nor can any form of energy be ruled out – and also diversity with regard to supply."
"We cannot rely on a single country or a small number of countries for our energy supply, but need diversity of suppliers too, and the principle of solidarity among all Member States of the EU applies here – we cannot leave anyone in the lurch."
"Speaking of the concept of solidarity – and looking here at Mr Kasoulides – I consider it unacceptable for us to negotiate with Turkey at the present time – and that is a decision, and taking a decision means the Treaties must be complied with – when Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States of the EU, when it does not extend the customs union under the Ankara Protocol to Cyprus."
"This runs contrary to the solidarity that unites us in the EU, and for this reason we must insist that the customs union be put into effect."
"My last comment concerns the debate on the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"I have my doubts as to whether this is the correct path to take, and I ask that we reconsider."
"Of course, the Council of Europe has been presented with a report by Jean-Claude Juncker on this subject."
"Parliament needs to consider the best means of cooperation with the Council of Europe and also with its Parliamentary Assembly."
"The work that the Council of Europe does today, which has proved its worth, should not simply be transferred to the institutions of the EU; instead, we should concentrate on ways of complementing each other, since the Council of Europe is also a European community of states, with 46 members."
"We have 25, soon to be more, and the activities of each community must complement the other’s sensibly."
"If the Council Presidency takes that into account at the Summit, my praise for the success of this Presidency will be even greater."
"I therefore wish the Presidency every success for the Brussels Summit tomorrow and the day after."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start with a comment for the benefit of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The day before yesterday, this Parliament adopted an interim report on the Temporary Committee on the CIA."
"The voting in my group was fairly consistent, that in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fairly inconsistent, but nevertheless a majority recognised that the EU is founded upon the rule of law – and I would ask the President-in-Office to convey that message to the Council in preparation for the meeting with George Bush."
"The existence of the EU and its Member States is based on the philosophy of the rule of law."
"The EU is a place where the rule of law prevails;"
"Guantánamo and the CIA flights are places of lawlessness."
"A community based on the rule of law such as the EU, which defends its values, must say a clear ‘no’ to the abuse of our institutions by the US secret services and an even more emphatic ‘no’ to the existence of legal vacuums such as Guantánamo."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to convey that message at the Summit."
"Mr Poettering has made reference to my legendary objectivity, for which I am most obliged to him."
"He forgot to add that he was quick to join my criticism of the President of the Commission when he and Mrs Martens sent a joint letter with similar content to the Commission President."
"To Mr Schüssel, too – all of them members of the PPE-DE Group."
"It is not our problem if your own house is not in order, Mr Poettering."
"The President of the Commission has merited praise today, therefore – if he says the right thing, we are on his side."
"We say ‘yes’ to the need for this Constitution, and ‘yes’ to the reforms that the Constitution must bring in order to replace the inadequate Treaty of Nice."
"The fact that he is now stating that in public rather than always leaving Commissioner Wallström in the lurch, that he is declaring his support for it in front of this Parliament, represents progress."
"Bravo, you have done well, Mr President of the Commission."
"That alone is insufficient, however – something else is needed, something that has also been mentioned today."
"We need to ask those whose referendums are responsible for throwing out this Constitution what they are actually proposing, how we can surmount this obstacle."
"The Governments of France and the Netherlands should also be obliged to suggest to the EU ways of resolving this dilemma."
"I have a suggestion for France."
"I am fairly sure that, if Mr Chirac were to announce that he would resign immediately if the people voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution, we would be assured of overwhelming majority support for the Constitution from the French."
"One thing is clear, however: the EU’s crisis is also a crisis for some governments, and that is the reason time and again for the inability of the European Council to move forward on most points, as some governments do not want this Constitutional Treaty and others are hiding behind those who do not want it."
"Incidentally, that is true of Denmark, Portugal and all those with a difference of opinion from the three present and future Council Presidencies."
"The Prime Minister of Finland, Matti Vanhanen, is courageous in symbolically ratifying and declaring his support for the Constitution during the Finnish Council Presidency."
"I think that it is good that Austrian Chancellor Schüssel has declared his support for this Constitution."
"Although the proposal he has made for this referendum is not a new one and has already been discussed by the Convention, it does show that Austria wants this Constitution."
"The German Government, which will then hold the third successive Council Presidency, has declared its firm support for this Constitution, which is a good sign."
"Anyone who says that this Constitution is dead is mistaken."
"The Council’s proposal, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, to demand a solemn declaration from leaders of whether they do indeed wish to further European integration, whether they really support the principles of deepening integration, whether they still support the spirit of the Treaties of Rome 50 years on, is a good idea."
"The content is what makes the difference – it must state that the solemn declaration being made is one not of noble objectives, but of concrete action."
"It could read, for example: yes, we want the Constitution – its content, in particular – to become reality."
"After all, one thing is absolutely clear – and I say this on behalf of our group and of all its members: we want EU enlargement."
"We welcome the draft conclusions on Romania and Bulgaria."
"We know that the prospective accession of the Balkan States has a peacemaking effect there."
"For this reason, we declare our belief in the necessity of enlargement."
"Without the constitutional reforms and the associated division of powers, however; without the clarity of action or the democratising potential that the Constitution holds, this enlargement is impossible – unless we want to destroy Europe, which we do not."
"For this reason, we are all required to continue to fight for this Constitution, so that Europe retains its basis in the rule of law and acquires the economic strength it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"Mr President, the success of this week’s Summit rests, first and foremost, on delivering on one concept: democratisation."
"Democracy, transparency and accountability must be the building blocks that shape the future of our Union."
"Without a clear commitment to all three, we will be left with the piecemeal solutions that have stalled reform efforts hitherto and reinforced public distrust in the Union."
"Europe will be built with the support of the citizens or not at all."
"Addressing the democratic deficit means an end to the rubber-stamping of regulations behind closed doors."
"That is why my group congratulates the Austrian Presidency on building on commitments to make transparency the rule rather than the exception in EU policy-making and welcomes the willingness shown by the President of the Commission to publish the names of those who sit on thousands of European Union advisory committees."
"We still look forward to receiving them, Mr Barroso."
"We call on the Council to announce that all discussions on lawmaking by codecision will be open to public view."
"We know – as the journalist Meg Greenfield wrote – that everybody is for democracy in principle, but it is only in practice that it gives rise to stiff objections."
"We note that, whatever they say in public, those two old secret plotters, Britain and France – the two countries that nurtured democracy at national level and yet with her offspring now suffer amnesia – are still resisting openness in the Council."
"It is up to the other countries to pull them kicking and screaming into the 21st century."
"In the short term, the Council must put its faith in Parliament and allow us greater legislative scrutiny."
"Key initiatives, particularly in justice and home affairs, are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate."
"The time has come to apply the clause of Article 42 and shift policies from the third to the first pillar, as proposed by the Commission in its Communication of 10 May, for our reputation – indeed our influence – rests on upholding values like democracy, liberty and respect for human rights."
"Data protection in the third pillar is necessary to ensure protection of personal data."
"Likewise, minimum procedural guarantees for the European Arrest Warrant – which I had the honour to pilot through this House – have been held up in the Council since 2001."
"We want to see progress on all of those issues in order to make the European Union more democratic and more effective."
"Europe demands no less than an unequivocal drive to democratise decision-making."
"In the long term, only a constitutional treaty – as practical as it is ideological – can provide the institutional framework to democratise Europe."
"But it is also time to recognise that the sixteenth and final Member State likely to ratify the Constitution in its current form is Finland."
"We must recognise that France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will never ratify the 2004 text."
"Denmark, Ireland and Sweden cannot ratify in current circumstances."
"The Czech Republic and Poland choose not to ratify, and Portugal will find it almost impossible, while committed to a referendum."
"So there are two options: renegotiation or oblivion."
"The sooner we take steps to make structural and substantive improvements to that text and address public concern, the better."
"President Barroso, I welcome the vision and determination you are showing today."
"But I want to hear you say that louder and more often to the Member States."
"You are right – they are all shareholders in the enterprise, but they have been gripped by a fad for short-termism, and anyway the markets are falling."
"We need to hammer home to the Member States just how much they need the European Union."
"My group thanks the Austrian Presidency for its good work thus far."
"We wish you success with other important items on your agenda: migration and other aspects of the Hague Programme; social and economic policy; the fundamental rights agency that we so badly need."
"Make sure too that our Foreign Ministers have aid to Palestine and CIA renditions on their agenda."
"The fine wines that you served them at Klosterneuburg were a good aperitif."
"They now need to sit down to the meat."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased, Mr Barroso, that you have changed your mind regarding what you said a year ago and regarding the Constitution."
"I only hope that you do not change your mind again and that you can demonstrate the same determination to the Member States too."
"Firstly, if the declaration must be ready in March and if the European Parliament intends to contribute to it in some way, I believe that we ought to say something different regarding the matter on which we are due to vote tomorrow, which is simply that we need to retain this text and that this Constitutional Treaty is the only thing that the European Parliament can accept."
"Mr Leinen, this resolution does nothing to further the debate on Europe that we all want."
"If we intend to achieve a result, then we must also make the content of our proposal clear."
"The Member States have not succeeded in doing this but, unfortunately, neither have we."
"Secondly, on the subject of sustainable development, we find a number of very interesting statements in the final declarations that we have received."
"Nevertheless, we believe that there are practical things that need to be done and that are not even being proposed."
"A more decisive measure is needed on climate change, on transport and on biodiversity, and the European Union’s funds need to be used in a more environmentally friendly way."
"Instead, all that we are doing is taking a step backwards, with a set of proposals on air, on waste and on many other subjects that well and truly baffle us."
"We are pleased that the importance of transparency has been reaffirmed yet again, even though we believe that it is far more important to effectively monitor the application of Community law than to get tangled up in complicated and very costly impact assessment procedures."
"This trend is very fashionable, but we feel that getting tangled up in complicated and not particularly transparent procedures is a danger to our democracy."
"Furthermore, Mr Barroso, we are still encountering a whole host of problems in terms of transparency and accessing documents, with regard to which we do not feel that the Commission is doing enough."
"We therefore endorse what the Council has done, even though we know that words are one thing and actions are quite something else, and we have already made various proposals and requests that have not been exhausted to date."
"Thirdly, I wanted to address the issue of the external dimension."
"Mr Winkler, on the subject of energy, we are slightly concerned by the fact that the only priority mentioned in the conclusions relates to the acquisition of resources and to the transportation of those resources within transit countries, while no reference is made whatsoever to eco-efficiency and renewable energy sources."
"These elements have an external dimension, however, because the 15 international car manufacturers have an impact on oil prices that is perhaps equal to that of OPEC."
"I believe that this silence from Europe is a negative element."
"Furthermore, in the final conclusions you state that it is hoped that a negotiating mandate will be adopted for the Balkans."
"Yet who should grant this mandate, if not the Presidency of the Council?"
"I believe that, on this point, over and above hoping, you ought to be more specific."
"I shall conclude by addressing you, Mr Winkler, because when you spoke about Tunisia yesterday, we were very disappointed and surprised."
"You said that a number of funds for NGOs had been released."
"That is not true, and the Commission also confirms it."
"The sum of EUR 900 000 for the Human Rights League has not been released, and I regard the fact that the Presidency is claiming the opposite here as extremely negative."
"I urge you to check your sources and to let us know whether or not this corresponds to the truth, because this is a very serious example contributing to Europe’s lack of credibility."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Winkler, each of the main agenda items for the forthcoming European Council in its own way raises the issue of the meaning of European integration."
"Such is the case with regard to the results of the famous period of reflection and to the common energy policy, and Europe’s action in the world does not escape attention either."
"I shall begin by mentioning the period of reflection and its extension."
"The first part of the Brussels Summit’s draft conclusion is dedicated to this and is charmingly entitled: ‘Europe listens’."
"That is all well and good, but what is it listening to?"
"The document elaborates on the measures to combat illegal immigration, which, I might add, are most unfortunately juxtaposed in the same sentence with trafficking in human beings, terrorism and organised crime."
"It deals with the Union's intervention mechanisms in the event of a crisis."
"It stresses the need, in future, to take the European Union’s absorption capacity more rigorously into account before embarking on the road to any further enlargement, and so forth."
"These are so many issues that are, I agree, present in the debate with our fellow citizens."
"Strangely enough, however, the issue that is at the heart of the crisis of confidence plaguing the Union, that is to say the social issue, is, for its part, completely sidelined in the European Council’s draft conclusion, which, in the course of one sentence, merely calls on the Commission to draft a report on the situation by next spring."
"Saying that is not tantamount to sinking into crisisphilia, Mr Barroso."
"I would point out that the Austrian Presidency itself put its finger on this issue as far back as January."
"That is what we must discuss first in order to draw the necessary conclusions from it."
"The public’s trust is not given as a matter of course."
"It is won."
"Let us turn now to the European energy policy."
"Helping to address the 21st century energy challenge is, in fact, a European responsibility ."
"Unbridled competition and the race for profitability are, however, unacceptable in this context."
"Preparing for the post-oil period, making far greater progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, developing the research effort with a view to increasing energy efficiency and diversity, transforming the way in which transport is organised and affirming the right to energy for all are eminently political tasks that, if they are to succeed, cannot be restricted by the short-sighted calculations of the market."
"Finally, the same debate concerns Europe’s ambitions in terms of external policy."
"Who can oppose the desire to provide ourselves, as the Commission is proposing, with operational instruments and rules able to increase the consistency, effectiveness and visibility of our external action?"
"It is my conviction, however, that the fundamental reason for the weakness of Europe’s action in the world is neither technical nor institutional."
"It is due to the tragic lack of political will and common vision at the European Council."
"How else can we interpret, at this very moment, the staggering inertia of the 25 faced with the Israeli Government's irresponsible torpedoing of the initiative of the Palestinian President, in flagrant and continual breach of both the UN resolutions and the Quartet’s road map?"
"All of that reinforces our idea that the famous period of reflection and Plan D will only be useful if they represent an opportunity to hold a trouble-free debate in the open on the structural changes to be promoted so that Europeans might once again see a reason to be positive about Europe in the world today."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as the Vice-President of the Commission, for their presentations and contributions."
"I would like to deal briefly with a number of issues that I think we should be addressing in Europe, before returning to the issue of the period of reflection on the Constitution."
"The Austrian Presidency has proven over the last few months that when you deal with a particular issue in a certain way you can achieve success."
"When you try and bring the different players together you can achieve a result that nobody thought possible."
"We have already seen this on a number of different legislative fronts, both in the cooperation with Parliament and in the work with the Commission."
"I think that is what Europe needs today: a greater understanding that there is a return on the investment made in terms of time and effort."
"That return is not just about esoteric ideals, but about creating real solutions to the problems that people face in their lives."
"Unfortunately, too much of the debate is now determined by what media commentators are saying, rather than what the citizens of the European Union are saying, because when you speak to people and ask them what their needs are, and what kind of Europe that they want to see, they all reply that they want an internal market, greater job security, greater energy security, better personal security and safety, for their children to have a safer and cleaner environment in which to live and for Europe to play a responsible role on the world stage."
"Taking all these things together, why do we in this Chamber seem to speak about a crisis of confidence in Europe, when the level of crisis, fear and loathing which some people would have you believe exists is simply not there among the general public?"
"There are a number of key things we can do in the coming Council meeting to try and drive things forward."
"First of all, there must be a restatement of commitment and idealism in respect of the Lisbon Agenda, establishing the genuine goals and targets of having, by 2010, the most dynamic economy in the world and creating the investment, research and development that we will need to create new jobs and new opportunities."
"We also need to follow through on existing dossiers, be it the services directive, the protection of public services or the right to universal service, and bring these into being."
"With regard to energy, the President of the Commission has come forward with a good policy for a common energy policy in Europe, but we should also look at the alternatives, including the opportunity to use fuel crops to produce energy."
"Finally, as regards the period of reflection on the Constitution, I consider it wrong to call it a constitution, and was delighted that the Foreign Ministers said in Austria that it was wrong to do so."
"However, it contains some good points and I welcome the perspective outlined for us by the President of the Commission, and the Vice-President of the Commission in particular, in pushing the idea of a Plan D and taking up on those good points and moving forward."
"My only words of caution are that we should not jump ahead of what the governments are willing to do, because ultimately the governments are the key representatives of their peoples and national interests."
"Mr President, what we should do, rather, is start afresh and set up a new, directly elected Convention to devise proposals that can then be put to referendums in all the Member States simultaneously."
"In that way we would obtain the ground rules that voters want and we could call the EU a democracy and a union of democracies."
"The Summit’s document on openness is a fig leaf."
"Last year, the EU adopted more than 3 000 acts."
"Fifty-seven of these were adopted through a joint decision-making process."
"Complete transparency and joint decision-making were also decided on at the Seville Summit in 2002 and again at the end of Tony Blair’s Presidency."
"Now it is Mr Blair’s own foreign minister, Margaret Beckett, who is trying to block progress at the last minute."
"If the measures are adopted in any case, journalists will all be able to write the joyful story of how the Summit met people’s expectations by making progress towards transparency."
"The majority of EU laws will, however, continue to be adopted by officials in 300 secret Council working parties after having been prepared in 3 000 other secret working parties under the auspices of the Commission."
"Instances of openness and democracy will continue to be exceptions to the rule."
"The real progress made at the Summit is in terms of its support for the Commission’s proposal that, in future, all proposals should be dealt with in proximity to the people, that is to say in the national parliaments."
"It is a constructive proposal, and the initiative now lies with the national parliaments."
"I hope that they are ready to seize the opportunity."
"– Mr President, allow me to offer some constructive advice."
"Use your many means and your sensory mechanisms to find out what the European public really wants."
"The answer will presumably be security, justice, accountability and democracy."
"The field of security is not doing too badly."
"The field of justice – which can only be the product of the two last-mentioned fields, namely democracy and control – is sadly lacking."
"I am convinced that the breakthrough can only come if you make a break with the things that have previously failed, move away from the things that have not worked: away from the Constitution and towards the Basic Treaty, with subsidiarity, transparency and control."
"There is a very great lack of this."
"I would ask you to understand that, to very many Europeans, the elite gathered in Brussels and Strasbourg is currently as welcome as chewing gum on the cashmere sweater of society."
"This has to change."
"When it does, you are in with a chance."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when he awarded the Charlemagne Prize, Jean-Claude Juncker said, among other things: ‘Thank goodness other people are watching us who are not Europeans."
"Africans, Asians, even Americans never cease to marvel at European successes."
"The only ones to grumble about them are the Europeans themselves."
"I cannot understand it.’"
"Neither can I. We should stop talking ourselves into a crisis and instead work together on the requisite projects and solutions."
"The President of the Commission is right in saying that Nice is insufficient."
"That is why we had Laeken, however, and Laeken produced the Convention – and so we have already drawn up a new Treaty that needs to be transposed."
"He is right in saying that the two referendums with a negative outcome have plunged us into a crisis that is partly reinforced by our calling it one."
"That is the reason for the period of reflection we have had for one year now."
"That is why we want to salvage the political project of the Constitution."
"Indeed, it has already been ratified by 16 Member States."
"To the President-in-Office of the Council I would say that I most definitely expect this Summit to put an end to any talk of the death of the political project of a new Treaty, and to result instead in all parties declaring their support for the decision on this political project, concluding it in this parliamentary term and continuing the ratification process."
"I expect there to be no talk of the crisis of the European Union, only talk of the political projects; I expect to see not only analysis, but also the setting of dates, the establishment of projects, the issuing of work orders, the establishment of timetables and the involvement of the public."
"Let us take over the parliamentary forums and establish them in the national and regional parliaments, too."
"Let us increase transparency and make Plan D more specific. This will enable the successful implementation of the political projects and mean that the period of analysis is a thing of the past."
"Mr President, the Council’s agenda features an important topic in the shape of the EU’s enlargement."
"I should like to say a few things about Romania and Bulgaria, which will be in the limelight today because of a resolution that Parliament will be adopting later on today."
"Last month, we debated here with Commissioner Rehn Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession further to the Commission’s progress report on the preparations of those two countries."
"This week, the Heads of State or Government will be addressing the same subject during their meeting."
"Our group takes the view that the Commission has reached an even-handed verdict."
"The Commission shares our ambition to hold firm to 1 January 2007 as the accession date for both countries, provided they apply themselves to addressing the outstanding reforms."
"Like the Commission, we are convinced that this should be possible without any problems."
"Our group has always been consistent in its support of Romania and Bulgaria joining on the planned date of 1 January 2007."
"Those two countries must now concentrate on tying up loose ends in order to meet the accession date."
"I think that both countries have the political impetus to achieve this."
"They both appear to have learnt their lesson, as was also the reaction in those countries to Commissioner Rehn's report."
"The reactions from Sofia and Bucharest to his report were very much to the point, to the effect that they had both made a note of what was required of them and they were going to go off and do just that."
"This attitude further strengthens my optimism that Romania and Bulgaria will take their homework seriously."
"Moreover, both countries have made considerable progress over the past year, which is encouraging."
"As such, it is not relevant to speculate about deferring their accession."
"Both candidate countries have demonstrated recently that they both have resolve in what they do, which gives my group the confidence that preparations will be completed in time."
"As such, we have, at the moment, no fundamental objections to the Commission proposal not to arrive at a final verdict until next October when our final report is due."
"We would welcome it if the Council were to adopt the Commission’s attitude."
"In adopting this attitude, we all have our own role to play."
"The roles of Romania and Bulgaria are clear."
"In the past, we have asked the Commission to make an extra effort in order to help Romania and Bulgaria in their preparations, and to be clear about what they expect of the candidate countries."
"We would reiterate that request now."
"The Council, too, has the responsibility to reach an even-handed verdict, but it also has the responsibility to ensure that the EU countries finish the ratification of the accession treaty on time."
"As was agreed last year with the European Commission, Parliament too will remain involved in monitoring the accession process right to the end, and I am convinced that this will result in a positive outcome."
"– Mr President, I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that, at the end of the Austrian Council Presidency, his country’s government has another chance to rescue the Council from its helplessness, as his country’s Presidency has produced very mixed results so far."
"I very much welcome the initiative for greater transparency in the decision-making process."
"As Mr Watson said, the Presidency really has passionate supporters of this in the shape of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"On the other hand, the irony of the story, in a way, is that 2006, in particular – the European Year of Workers’ Mobility – has seen the adoption of a Services Directive that hinders that very mobility."
"As regards the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, however, the Council must understand that this Treaty has failed in its present form."
"If we are really serious about the ubiquitous profession that the focus of European policy must be on the citizen, we cannot simply ignore the ‘no’ in France and the Netherlands, nor can we ignore the fact that other Member States have already announced that they will not be ratifying this Constitutional Treaty."
"Europe needs a constitution – that much is perfectly clear – and the substance of this Constitutional Treaty is good, but specific proposals must be made for what can be changed."
"In this context, I was very pleased to read an interview with the boss of the President-in-Office, Wolfgang Schüssel, in the German newspaper – for two reasons."
"Firstly, he said that he supports Germany in the World Cup."
"I think that is excellent – now we are sure to win."
"Secondly, however, he took up the proposal to hold a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day in all the Member States of the EU."
"I think that is excellent, as such a step would really bring citizens and European institutions closer together."
"In addition, it would really be a historic event: a constitution that citizens had awarded themselves – that would really be an important Treaty."
"The President-in-Office said, in all modesty, that there were no epoch-making decisions on the Council’s agenda."
"Yet if he succeeds in putting the idea of a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day throughout Europe in front of the other Heads of State or Government and in winning support for it among them, he will be able to say, in all modesty, that he has produced epoch-making decisions."
"I wish him every success in this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow is the day when the Heads of State or Government come together to ceremonially extend their period of inaction and helplessness."
"Guy Verhofstadt called it a ‘deafening silence’: the din of cherry picking, subsidiarity and proportionality, of ‘emergency brakes’ and ‘core groups’ from the sandpits of technocracy – most of these terms not even translatable from the English."
"We have another year of this din in store for us."
"I wish to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that an interim report on the European debate is due to be presented at the end of his country’s Presidency in June of this year – but there is no debate."
"The Presidency has promised us a roadmap for overcoming the crisis in Europe – but does not have one."
"It has promised that Europe would listen – but its discussions have been held in closed circles among hand-picked elites, have been held with experts behind closed doors, and the Presidency has only heard what it wanted to hear."
"The citizens are not speaking about all of this."
"Having had one year to think things over, the President of the Commission comes here and gives the following answer to the question as to the causes of the Europessimism of the people: the cause is the failed referendums."
"The President is mixing up cause and effect."
"The failed referendums are the result rather than the cause of Europessimism."
"The cause is the failure of intergovernmental Europe, of its massive democratic deficit, of its weak legitimacy, of its becoming bogged down in unanimity and nationalistic rivalry."
"The Governments have been standing in the way of Europe."
"They want to rule Europe as a sideline."
"They are not able to come up with a social response to globalisation."
"These are the causes of the pessimism among Europeans."
"They are disappointed in Europe; and that is why a European democracy is needed."
"I hope that this understanding plays a role in the Council, too."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last year has been marked by numerous popular protests against the Services Directive, but also by campaigns against the dismantling of social services and the weakening of democracy."
"I need only point to the campaigns in France, Greece and Germany – in Germany, the protests by university-clinic doctors that have been going on for months already are still continuing – and all of this is connected with the politics we are pursuing at national and European level."
"It is time for not only governments, but also the Commission and Parliament, to realise at long last that, outside the European institutions, the EU public started long ago to develop its own conception of a different Europe, a different EU."
"Nevertheless, it has become apparent from the plans for and deliberations on the forthcoming Summit that have been seen to date that the European Council wishes to give the public the impression of having understood the ‘no’ to the European Constitution as a criticism of merely the style of politics, rather than of official policy and priorities."
"At all events, neither Plan D, a white paper on grass-roots communication, a great deal of paper, nor a number of new websites have changed the priorities of this policy."
"That is, unless the listening of which Commissioner Wallström has just spoken results in the requisite corrections at long last."
"Admittedly, if she were to understand the requisite measures of which she has just spoken in the sense of these corrections, she would have our wholehearted support."
"However, the reaction that we have seen thus far this year strikes me as showing lack of understanding."
"In my view, a further demonstration of this is the recent proposal by the Austrian Council Presidency to put the old text of the Constitution, without amendments, to a direct vote in the EU Member States."
"That is unacceptable – corrections must be made."
"Once this has been done, it is perfectly legitimate to consider holding a referendum."
"We must finally put an end to the situation seen up to now, in which the various countries have merely been engaging in ratification and glorification."
"In this respect, the opportunity of the 50th anniversary that has just been mentioned should actually be taken to hold a democratic debate on the EU’s plans and projects to date, and thus also to enable a new start for the European Union."
"I am sorry."
"If your group gives you two minutes’ speaking time, then you stick to those two minutes."
"This is not the beginning of the end of your speech, it is the end of your speech."
"Could people please stick to their speaking time."
"Mr President, the European Council will once again discuss the future of the Constitutional Treaty at its forthcoming meeting in Brussels."
"However, there is a saying that you should not flog a dead horse."
"The Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected in referendums by the French and the Dutch, is just such a dead horse, regardless of how many Member State parliaments ratify it."
"It is difficult to imagine that any French or Dutch leader would be willing to put the same document to their people again."
"Moreover, in the Treaty there is a clear attempt to move towards a single European state, although in recent years Europe has witnessed trends in quite the opposite direction."
"Before our very eyes, eight independent states emerged from Yugoslavia."
"One of those countries is now in the European Union and the others are knocking at the European Union’s door."
"In Spain, the separatist tendencies in Catalonia are hard to overlook, while in Belgium it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain unity between Wallonia and Flanders."
"It is therefore impossible to accept a text which appears to steer against these patently obvious processes."
"Let us therefore stop flogging this dead horse and deal with issues that are really important to Europe and its citizens."
"We need to support entrepreneurship and create new jobs, we need reforms to accelerate economic growth and increase tax revenues in order to allow greater spending on social programmes, education, public healthcare and pensions."
"If the European Union is effective in resolving these problems, then Europe will also function well without the Constitutional Treaty."
"Mr President, the European Council is once again returning to the issue of the draft Constitution for Europe, in spite of the fact that the text which it is stubbornly attempting to resuscitate is dead."
"Some commentators have referred to these actions as political necrophilia."
"European Union citizens do not want the Constitution and their wishes should be respected."
"This seems to go unnoticed by Commissioner Wallström, amongst others, who recently stated, during a meeting in Krakow, that it is vital for the European Constitution to be ratified."
"However, she did not say how the Constitution would resolve the specific problems of the citizens of the Member States or what would happen to the citizens of those countries which have already rejected this Constitution in democratic referendums."
"The Constitutional Treaty is a threat to democracy as it has nothing to do with the participation of citizens in deciding the fate of their countries or with the accountability of politicians to their electorate."
"Mr President, the people of France and the Netherlands are sticking to their guns."
"According to a British poll, 74% of French people and 75% of Dutch people do not believe that a single part of the European Constitution should be implemented, unless a decision is made to hold another referendum."
"This is a bitter show of dissent for Mr Sarkozy who, disregarding the vote cast by the French population, wants to make the congress vote again just on parts I and II of the Constitution."
"It is also a show of dissent for those who wanted to make the people of France and the Netherlands vote again on the Constitution, a Constitution accompanied by a social protocol designed to reassure the French and by a protocol on subsidiarity designed to reassure the Dutch."
"It never rains but it pours for the Euro-federalists: according to the same poll, 63% of French people and 68% of Dutch people want to take back a number of powers from the European Union or to leave it altogether."
"This is an act of revenge by the European nations on the ideological and irresponsible Eurocrats in Brussels."
"It is also the return of the right of the peoples and nations to follow their own destiny and to defend their sovereignty and their identity."
"Let us return to the Europe of realities and the Europe of nations, which the British and the Danes were able to retain so successfully."
"They rejected the Schengen Agreement and a Europe overrun by massive influxes of immigrants granted residence and work permits on the initiative of Mr Zapatero and Mr Berlusconi."
"They rejected the euro and its budgetary austerity pact, which curbs growth."
"They rejected the European Super-State, which is aimed at destroying the nations of Europe."
"The fact that a decision will be made during the forthcoming European Council in Brussels to extend the period of reflection by one year reveals – – if there were any need to reveal it – – the divide that exists between the nations of Europe and the self-proclaimed elites, who have not learnt a single thing and who act as though nothing had happened."
"They did not grasp the fact that Europeans were feeling deceived by this passive, ultraliberal Europe, which is all about fine words and slogans and which has the weakest growth rate in the world and the highest unemployment rate."
"They did not grasp the fact that the nations of Europe did not want Turkey in Europe and that the Turkish advance imposed by Brussels was creating an irreparable split."
"Mr President, this Summit is scheduled to be, in part at least, a stocktaking exercise on the European Constitution."
"Yet the Constitution, however you look at it, is to a large extent discredited."
"France and the Netherlands should not be asked to vote on it again, and the Dutch Prime Minister’s remarks should be taken very seriously."
"The longer this issue drags on, the more out of touch the European Union appears to be with its citizens."
"We must move on from the endless debate on constitutional mechanics and get on with delivering results, because if we do not do that, citizens will conclude that their leaders have learned nothing."
"Cherry-picking from the constitutional text, at this stage at least, would be unproductive."
"However, we certainly need a Europe of results, as President Barroso has rightly suggested."
"I personally also want to see a Europe of real reform, because without reform there can be no results."
"Progress has been made in economic reform and I congratulate President Barroso and his colleagues for the work they have done there."
"However, we need to do much more and be more focused, as Mrs Wallström said, on achieving the concrete results."
"There is one other thing I briefly want to mention."
"The British Foreign Secretary said that she will try to overturn decisions on opening up Council meetings to public scrutiny."
"This is absolutely astonishing and worrying and is a U-turn in British Government policy."
"Mr Blair constantly preached the virtues of more openness during his Presidency and we got a specific agreement that we would get openness in relation to Council meetings and Council processes."
"It is absolutely essential that the other governments give the British Foreign Secretary a short, sharp shock at her first Summit and ignore her attempts to preserve secrecy in this unfair and unacceptable way."
"What has she got to hide?"
"It is a shameful move on the part of the British Government and I hope it will be soundly defeated."
"Mr President, it has already been said that the forthcoming European Council will not have any dramatic decisions to take."
"Nevertheless, it could give out a very important twofold signal, namely ‘yes’ to enlargement, but also ‘yes’ to strengthening the institutions of the European Union, particularly in the context of the Union’s capacity to cope with enlargement."
"It never ceases to amaze me when some of our British fellow Members say that we do not need a constitution but we do need a lot of new Members."
"Equally, some Polish fellow Members – particularly on the right – are opposed to the Constitution, but believe that Ukraine must join as soon as possible."
"That will not be possible."
"There will not be majority support among the people, or in this House, for further enlargement unless the relevant changes are also made, including the EU’s capacity to cope with this enlargement."
"We need to face this fact."
"Anyone in favour, as I am, of setting further enlargement in motion will certainly be reflecting on how to make a place in the EU for Ukraine."
"He or she will also have to state quite clearly, however, that the EU first needs to be given the necessary strength."
"The fundamental content of this Constitution needs to be implemented, however, be it in the present or an amended Constitution."
"If there is a consensus on this and the Council also says so clearly, this will send out a clear signal, the right signal."
"As rapporteur for Croatia, I am also delighted that a clear signal has been sent out to Croatia."
"The country has long deserved its own negotiations."
"I will also be very pleased when we state clearly – including in relation to Thessaloniki, and maybe in even stronger terms than we did in Salzburg – that we have an obligation to the Balkans, not only in the interests of the countries themselves, but also in our own interests."
"If, however, we also state clearly and unambiguously that we first need to strengthen and reform our institutions accordingly – people will understand – then that will be an important signal; one could even say that it was an epoch-making signal that this European Council was sending out."
"As regards the partnership with the USA, the Summit with this country follows the European Council, and preparations will also have to be made for this."
"We have said time and again that this partnership is desirable and necessary."
"Yet it must be based on common values, one of which is respect for human rights, and that is why Guantánamo and the issue of the activities of the CIA are so important to us, why it is so important to us that these issues be on the agenda."
"This is not because we want to detract from the USA or from the fight against terrorism, but because we want to conduct the fight against terrorism alongside the USA – on the basis of these common values."
"Mr President, I have an appeal to make to the EU Heads of State or Government when they meet in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday."
"First and foremost, they should involve the EU in their national debates."
"When reforms are debated in the Member States, not a single word is said about the EU."
"The fact is that the EU really is a completely foreign concept when the welfare state is subject to review."
"In, for example, Germany, France and my own country, Denmark, we are currently debating what economic reforms are needed to secure welfare in the future."
"All national politicians – ministers as well as ordinary members of parliaments – should, however, be clear that a strong and effective EU is absolutely necessary and is a precondition for any welfare state."
"Why, then, this deafening silence?"
"What is the use of the Commission and Parliament setting all these resources aside for a dialogue with the people when national politicians let the side down in such a damaging way?"
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have constantly worked to bring about openness in the Council of Ministers."
"Why is the United Kingdom now suddenly faltering after Tony Blair promised here in Parliament to open up the meetings of the Council of Ministers?"
"It is simply not good enough."
"Openness about the work of the EU is an absolute necessity if we are to be closer to the people."
"I would therefore call on all the Heads of State or Government to open up the meetings of the Council of Ministers so that everyone can see how they proceed, can hopefully see that there is nothing to hide and can see whether ministers have actually been present."
"We should thus also avoid holding 25 different press conferences in which everyone is a hero."
"I am also looking forward to the Presidency giving a favourable reception to President Borrell’s call for action to bring about a one-seat EU."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, Mr Barroso, I should like to go back over one part of your speech."
"You said, with good reason:, that we must progress on two levels: The strengthening of the single market, on the one hand, and social solidarity, on the other."
"I would add: social justice and equity."
"I believe, Mr Barroso, that the rejection and the Europessimism are fuelled by a rather keen awareness of the fact that we are not actually progressing on two levels and that the action of your Commission, like, I might add, that of the Council, has been to prioritise the first level."
"I should like to tell you or to remind you that, under your Presidency, as, moreover, under the Prodi Commission, no new social legislation has been decided on by the European institutions."
"Furthermore, no new collective agreement between social partners has been decided on either."
"It is this serious imbalance – I believe – that is increasingly affecting one section of the population, the one which, as a result of globalisation, has the most uncertain status."
"It seems to me that the Council, Parliament and the Commission should respond to this situation."
"That brings me to my second point, which concerns the instruments designed to promote social solidarity or social justice."
"Mr Barroso, we will be unable to build an equitable model in the future if we do not have a fiscal policy at European level."
"That is the contradiction between those who are reluctant to pursue enlargement and those who want more social justice: maintaining unanimity on all fiscal matters amounts to standing in the way of a possible European fiscal policy."
"It has taken 15 years to have a directive on savings income, which is, for that matter, full of derogations, and we are not making any progress on common standards in relation to corporate tax."
"To conclude, Mr President, the European Union’s political project does not amount to a single market, which we need, but to a form of competition among national models."
"We need a more proactive approach and more common policies at European level in order to guarantee fairness and a European social model."
"Mr President, if we did not have a European Union, there would certainly be a need for a Europe-wide cooperative that contributes to a better life for those living in the border regions, to cross-border aspects of the environment, energy supply, consumer protection and to the protection of health against internationally tradeable dangerous substances."
"People want a Europe that helps remove the barriers for peace, social security, public services and international solidarity."
"This is quite different from adorning a world power or increasing the freedom of international corporations."
"People want a Europe that helps them solve their problems, rather than a Europe that causes inconvenience."
"People no longer recognise that Europe in the Union’s current phase."
"Voters in two countries have given us a signal that things must change."
"If we want to stick with the European Union that we have, it will have to be fed from the bottom up, by our citizens and their organisations."
"Continuing with constructions from the top down, dreamt up by the powers that be, will not solve anything."
"We will need to use enlargement and the increased involvement of our citizens creatively in order to make a new and better start possible."
"Mr President, the majority of the reforms required can be carried out without the new treaty."
"One example is the agenda of the forthcoming European Council meeting, which will address the extension of the Schengen area, the issue of rendering the debates of the Council more transparent, the negotiations on European Union enlargement and the reform of external policies."
"Let us not make the Treaty of Nice unpalatable to Europeans, as it is all we have today."
"We not only need to reflect on the new treaty, but also on the political will of Member States and their citizens in relation to carrying out common tasks."
"The problem is not the lack of a new treaty but the lack of shared beliefs concerning the future."
"We announce better legislation and yet we are adopting a Services Directive that is so vague that the European Court of Justice is rubbing its hands with glee at the prospect of the ensuing cases which will give it even more power."
"We announce common interests in energy matters, yet on a daily basis we are conducting an utterly selfish energy policy."
"We announce investment in research, yet the European Technology Institute is withering away before our eyes, ripped apart as a result of national self-interest."
"We claim to espouse the principle of subsidiarity, yet we are funding a framework research programme which will be cofinanced by all European taxpayers, even though some of the research concerned is illegal in many Member States."
"These are real splits which, if we wish Europe well, are regrettable."
"These are splits which place larger question marks over the state of the European project than the demise of one or other treaty."
"Mr President, the European Council must end the confusion about the status of the European Constitution once and for all."
"While one Member State declares the document dead, another Member State ratifies the Constitution as if nothing was wrong."
"I appeal to the Heads of State or Government to put an end to this confusion; if not, public confidence in the Union will wane even further."
"I support extending the period of reflection by one year, on the condition that we go back to the drawing board for a completely new treaty document."
"I would prefer a treaty document to a constitution, a manageable document that combines the previous treaties, a treaty in which the Union, within a defined space, demonstrates its added value in the area of cross-border policy challenges."
"I would particularly call on the Austrian Presidency to show leadership by finally removing the confusion that has come about and to give the emergence of a new treaty framework a shot in the arm."
"Austria is finally leaving its mark on this programme, something which I have waited for for six months."
"Mr President, we like to claim that the EU is a Union of values based on democracy and the rule of law."
"Yet when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, when the Irish voted against the Treaty of Nice in 2000, they were told to go away and try again."
"So much for democracy!"
"When the French and Dutch voted against the Constitution last year, we ignored their verdict."
"We are trying to revive a constitution which is dead in its own terms."
"We are implementing large parts of it with no legal basis."
"So much for the rule of law!"
"In our pigheaded determination to press on with the European project in defiance of public opinion, we show our brazen contempt for the voters and for democratic values."
"The voters are starting to notice."
"Amongst my East Midlands constituents I sense a growing concern and, indeed, anger against the European project."
"So, press ahead with the EU Constitution if you must, but be warned: you are fuelling public resentment, which will blow the European construction apart."
"Mr President, illegal immigration has become one of the European Union’s major challenges."
"In Spain, for example, according to all the opinion polls, it is seen as the country’s second biggest problem."
"I would therefore have liked to have heard the Austrian Presidency say something more decisive, more ambitious and more concrete about the progress you expect from the next European Council in this field."
"Besides the provision in the draft Constitution, we could – and in my view we should – continue to make progress on the communitisation of measures to combat illegal immigration."
"I am well aware that some people will say that certain governments take decisions against the wishes of their European partners, ignoring the Commission, and then, when problems arise, they want them to be resolved amongst all of us."
"I would like to say to those people, however, that, with a Community policy on immigration, there would never be mass regularisation without control, and the 'pull factor' which we are currently so afraid of would not therefore exist."
"Legal immigrants must be guaranteed integration and equal rights and obligations."
"By the way, we could consider transitional measures for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who – I too am sure – will soon be Community citizens."
"Moving on to other issues, the Presidency referred in passing to the document requested of Michel Barnier."
"Since last summer, Parliament has done a lot of work on natural disasters; we have visited the areas affected and, as noted in a resolution approved practically unanimously, we have seen great dissatisfaction in society and too little coordination amongst the competent administrations."
"Finally, I would like to say that you have not said anything about the Regulation on the Funds."
"One detail remains to be resolved, Mr President, so that Parliament can vote for it during the first week of July."
"Your colleagues can tell you about it, but I would ask you to make a final effort and I wish you the best of luck."
"Mr President, the European Union and the world need reliable, affordable and sustainable energy flows."
"I have just quoted Mr Solana."
"The interesting document he addressed to the European Council is distinguished by a number of deafening silences: while he does indeed speak of the need for an energy policy for Europe and for an action plan incorporating a number of priorities, Mr Solana carefully avoids mentioning concepts such as the ‘common energy market’ and the ‘single market’."
"In short, the Europe of necessary solidarity on energy is still very much in limbo."
"The fact is that the energy issue is going to become a key element of all European policies."
"Energy will dictate our international relations policy."
"The economic, environmental and social policies of our countries will be governed by it."
"Energy will have more and more of an influence on all of the Union’s policies: from agriculture to structural policies, via housing, transport and research."
"In spite of that, Europe’s response to the various energy challenges remains weak and lacklustre."
"What should be done?"
"In order to influence its external supplies, Europe must first display its internal solidarity, its will to build a genuine common market."
"Mr Solana tells us that the best way of guaranteeing a reliable and affordable energy supply is to have the world markets function properly."
"The fact is that the world markets are dominated by cartels and oligopolies."
"Where is the free and transparent market dear to the liberals?"
"Gazprom has just begun talks with the Algerian company Sonatrach, whose aim is certainly not to do the Union any favours."
"Is it not time for the countries with high energy consumption to organise themselves, in turn?"
"In its resolution on the Lisbon Strategy, Parliament called on the Union to consult with the US, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians, with a view to preventing a form of competition that would end up ruining everyone."
"Europe must invest in energy efficiency, in new technologies and in renewable energy sources."
"Everyone knows that Europe’s future energy supply will be neither 100% nuclear nor 100% renewable."
"We need as intelligent an energy mix as we can possibly have, bearing in mind the differences in geography and climate within the Member States, as well as their resources in terms of primary energy, biomass and so on."
"The Union cannot overlook any course of action."
"All forms of research must be encouraged."
"Then, above all, Europe must become more united and more vigorous in defending our common interests."
"Mr President, the purpose of this debate is to provide President Borrell with something interesting to say when he speaks at the European Council tomorrow."
"I fear that if Parliament simply agrees the line proposed by the PPE-DE and PSE Groups, we will be signing up to the same paralysis that exists within the Council."
"President Barroso is quite correct in saying that we must make progress on policies, and a ‘Messina 50’ is probably a positive proposal, but what is the point of extending the period of reflection without providing a target and a purpose for the reflection?"
"Procrastination is not a credible policy."
"Waiting for the successors of Chirac, Balkenende and Blair to be thrusting federalists is a crazy fantasy."
"What we require is for the European Council to establish a rendez-vous with a decision in the autumn of 2007, setting up a fresh conference to renegotiate Part 3 of the Constitution."
"These are not just legal problems, President-in-Office, but a profound political crisis which we must address."
"I expect it is going to be possible to ring-fence the classical constitutional provisions that we find in the first and second parts of the Constitution, around which consensus still exists."
"However, it is Part 3 which contains the common policies that have so greatly disappointed public opinion in France and the Netherlands and in several other places, notably as regards social and economic policy and the issue of borders."
"In fact, we have little choice."
"We either try to improve the product and market it effectively within the court of public opinion, or we consign the whole project to oblivion."
"Mr President, one of the main mechanisms for the integration of Europe is the enlargement of the European Union."
"Bulgaria and Romania are at the doors of the EU, Turkey is already negotiating its accession conditions, the new state of Montenegro has expressed its hope of becoming a member of the European Union, and other states in the Balkans may follow suit."
"In this context, I should like to focus on the issue of the Copenhagen criteria and the policies related to minorities."
"Many states are still following the old-fashioned French model and trying to assimilate those who have a language and culture different to that of the state."
"In Romania, for instance, there is a large Hungarian-speaking minority, whose rights must be fully recognised before Romania enters the European Union as a way of recognising internal diversity."
"That is to say as a way of respecting human rights, because fulfilling minority rights is absolutely essential to respecting human rights."
"The European Union gives hope to minorities."
"Please do not disappoint them."
"Mr President, the Council’s draft conclusions begin with the title ‘Europe listens’."
"The question is whether that is true."
"The EU might listen, but is it concerned about what people are actually saying?"
"A year ago, the referendums in the Netherlands and France sent clear messages to the EU."
"The draft Constitution was rejected by large majorities."
"If the EU had listened, that decision would have been respected."
"Instead, what was referred to as a period of reflection was introduced, with the unexpressed but clear aim of having the same Constitution smuggled in later, notwithstanding the will of the people."
"Now, debate and reflection have been announced, but a debate aimed only at having the same Constitution dusted off later is meaningless."
"All the answers to emerge from such a debate are provided in advance."
"Such a period of reflection is in danger of turning into manipulation rather than genuine democratic debate."
"If the desire is for an open debate on the EU’s future, the democratic ground rules must be respected, and it must be made clear that the Constitution has been rejected once and for all."
"Mr President, we are to have an extended period of reflection, are we?"
"Some people who are having periods of reflection are otherwise known to be ‘in retreat’ and some retreats are made in better order than others."
"Some people, Mr Barroso, might have learned from reflection to date, saying that perhaps it was not the case, or that they might have done things differently, or even, perish the thought, that they were wrong."
"But all we have heard this morning is, ‘We were right."
"The people of France and Holland are wrong."
"The Constitution should be brought back’."
"You have employed new architects to build on exactly the same foundations of integration, over-regulation and empirical ambition."
"Fortunately, only three people in ten in Britain any longer believe any of this rubbish, so roll on our referendum, whatever the question!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention two topics, namely enlargement and the fight against terrorism."
"As regards enlargement, I shall highlight the importance of the compatibility criterion and of absorption capacity, which I am afraid has not been strongly supported by my country in the debates within the Council."
"As regards terrorism, a truly obvious question must be asked."
"How is this commitment on the part of the European Union compatible with the recent appointment in Italy of the former terrorist, Mr D’Elia, who is guilty of being an accessory to the murder of an Italian police officer?"
"The ties of solidarity linking the European left to the new Italian Government have until now prevented this obvious question from being brought to people’s attention and debated within the European Union."
"This is disgraceful when we consider that, in Italy, the terrorism of the and groups has affected not only police officers, judges, politicians and industrialists, but also trade unionists and exponents of the best Labour culture, such as Professor Biagi."
"Mr President, Mr Winkler, your Presidency can already boast of a positive track record."
"We congratulate you on it."
"As for the European Council that is due to take place, it is not in a position to take major decisions, but it may have a decisive influence on the future fate of the European Union."
"Paving the way for a revival or endorsing a failure: that is the challenge awaiting you."
"You will have to determine the strategy for future enlargements."
"I call on you to stop forging ahead regardless, an approach further illustrated by the opening of detailed negotiations with Turkey, even though the latter does not fulfil the political conditions and is making no further progress with regard to integrating the ."
"From now on, we must regard the European Union’s absorption capacity as a key parameter."
"There can be no further enlargement without an improvement in the decision-making mechanisms, without a sufficient budget, without new resources and without a genuine agreement on the nature of the European project."
"This is what it is basically about: constructing a political Europe by setting out the timetable for implementing the main reforms contained in the Constitutional Treaty, which we refuse to forget about."
"The Convention obtained a result that cannot be overturned."
"We must go beyond Nice."
"What should the content of the European policies be?"
"We do not want Europe to devote the bulk of its decisions to improving the internal market, that is to say, to creating a vacuum."
"We want a Europe that builds."
"We want the governments and our Parliament to draft the policies that we need: on immigration, energy, economic coordination, research, security and foreign relations."
"Contrary to what is claimed, Europeans want more Europe, but they want a Europe that creates forms of solidarity, that guarantees security, that makes an impact on the world and that does not just police the market."
"They want a Europe, too, that respects its most sacred commitments: Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament."
"A great deal of lucidity and courage will be required."
"We trust that you will provide evidence of this at the end of June."
"Mr President, we have been saying that Europe is a citizens’ Europe, because the European Union exists through them and for them."
"At the same time, we are feeling the uncertainty, and we are actually voicing our questions, because we know that decisions have become disassociated from citizens, who tend to view the results of the Community as natural; however, solidarity does not come naturally to everyone, as you would like it to be, Mr President, and I have deep sympathy for everything you have said concerning this issue."
"The political effect of the enlargement is making itself felt behind the will of those who voted against, and solidarity has not become second nature to our operation, but, like you, I do have hopes for the future."
"We want more solidarity and a continuously consolidating democracy, and this is why we need the Constitution."
"On the other hand, we are, at times, at a loss as to why the old Member States, during the Council session, abandoned their former initiative concerning the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency, when we, new Member States, are continuously proving ourselves in matters of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Even today, the importance of democracy, openness and transparency has not been questioned by anybody."
"But when it comes to human rights, why do we prefer to examine others rather than ourselves, the Member States of the European Union?"
"We will not be able to avoid Community control in respect of the enforcement of human rights."
"A few thoughts about the social dimension of the European Union: the European Union has taken into account the challenges faced by new Member States."
"We believe that defining preferences for the European Social Fund is particularly important in the course of the determination of social policy objectives."
"But in order to ensure that the social Europe is truly social, it is not sufficient to emphasise the objectives of competitiveness versus those of employment; we must also emphasise social cohesion, because in the absence of social cohesion, not only nations, but the European Union itself may become divided."
"At this point I would like to add that we are grateful that the Roma problem has recently been emphasised to the extent that we have seen."
"Finally, when it comes to catching up, some are travelling in a high-speed elevator to the designated floor, while others have to struggle on the stairs."
"Let us think of those who have started the painstaking process of climbing the stairs."
"Mr President, Poland supports the Constitutional Treaty."
"Do not listen to Polish politicians."
"Listen instead to public opinion in Poland."
"Over 60% of Poles support the Constitutional Treaty."
"If that is the case, what can we do to make sure it comes into force?"
"The period of reflection is for the citizens and not for the European institutions."
"For them, it is time to get down to work."
"The Austrian Presidency can be proud of its many achievements, three of which I would like to point out today."
"First of all, there is Strasbourg."
"The optimism of Mozart’s music encouraged European politicians to be optimistic about the Constitution, something that is significant."
"Secondly, I think that the heeding of Parliament’s call for Council debates to be more transparent was a very important step and I congratulate the Austrian Presidency on this achievement."
"Thirdly, Mr Barnier’s report, which is one of the most interesting European documents to have been drawn up recently, will also stimulate debate."
"However, what should we do at this point?"
"Right now, together with the Commission, we have to address two serious social problems."
"This is something the subsequent presidencies should also address."
"First of all we need to deal with the problem of immigrants in Europe and, secondly, the problem of Europe’s social dimension."
"They should become the focus of Community policy, of a common European policy."
"Finally, we need to ask what can be done to make the constitutional text possible?"
"This lies in the hands of the European Commission."
"The third part of the Constitutional Treaty largely repeats treaties that have already been ratified."
"The European Commission should carry out a legal analysis and only the 25 or so amendments that have already been tabled should be included in the first part of the treaty and be subject to an immediate decision."
"This is a great task for the European institutions and I would like to express my faith in the Commission and the Presidency of the European Union."
"– Mr President, there are two issues here: do we have and to what extent do we respect democracy in Europe and who is ultimately in charge."
"If we truly believe in democracy and that the Constitution will bring change to the lives of the people of Europe, we should allow the people of Europe to have their say in a referendum."
"We should not be afraid of the people of Europe."
"Who is in charge?"
"Are you in charge, Mr President of the Commission?"
"If you really are in charge, tell me where the southeast borders of Europe are."
"You do not know, because Turkey does not allow you to know."
"Well done."
"Let me ask you about the law of the sea."
"It applies everywhere in Europe except to the Aegean."
"Well done."
"Which country is threatening Europe?"
"Only Turkey in the Aegean with its ."
"Well done."
"Which country is violating Europe?"
"Is it Russia?"
"No, it is not. It is Turkey every day in the Aegean."
"Well done."
"Which country does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus?"
"It is Turkey."
"Well done."
"Which country is occupying 40% of a country of Europe?"
"It is Turkey."
"Well done."
"Where is the effigy of the Ecumenical Patriarch mocked and hanged?"
"In Turkey and you tolerate it."
"Well done."
"These are the facts, Mr President of the Commission, and I propose that your next meeting with Mr Bush should be held not in the Azores, but at Guantánamo."
"That is where you should hold it, so that you finally understand what is happening in this world and how you are colluding in the crimes of the Americans."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the Austrian Presidency, Chancellor Schüssel promised movement on the Constitution talks."
"I therefore expect a clear message from the Council meeting that the text foisted on the citizens is incomprehensible, unfair and, most importantly, dead, and that the time has come to draw up a new document."
"Given that Chancellor Schüssel is a politician who stands by his words, he should not accept the manipulative delaying tactics employed by Chancellor Merkel and President Chirac."
"They want to leave the Constitution to mature ‘naturally’ for one more year, and then to come to a decision on it during the German and French Presidencies."
"Austria is, from a historical perspective, in the best position to alter this process."
"It has already travelled down the path of attempts at European integration."
"Less than a hundred years ago, the Austro-Hungarian Empire united 21 European countries."
"It only lasted for 51 years, however."
"Why was that?"
"Problems were not addressed and were left to mature ‘naturally’."
"I feel that extending the period of reflection on the current Constitution shows disdain for the citizens and the campaign to resurrect it is simply throwing their money down the drain."
"– Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I address you, Mr Barroso, because I welcomed your speech this morning in which you revived Europe’s great project."
"We have at last heard the Commission raise its voice loudly in this House in order to revive politics and to secure the Union's due role on the international stage."
"This is the Commission that we want and that Europeans want too."
"It is a Commission that is shaking off the burden of bureaucracy, which is mainly to blame for the people of Europe’s estrangement from the institutions."
"Mr Barroso, I agree with you."
"If we give up in the face of difficulty and if we allow ourselves to become overwhelmed by pessimism, then we will not achieve any objective whatsoever."
"Politics must not fail the great challenge of building a Europe that is aware of the role it must carry out on the international stage, that is to say, a Europe that exports peace, a Europe that is capable of taking a leading role in the Mediterranean, in the Middle East, in the Balkans and in the fight against terrorism and against counterfeiting, a Europe of strong transatlantic relations."
"That is why the constitutional process needs to be concluded."
"The first six months of next year are crucially important."
"We support the German Presidency in preparing – as the Austrian Presidency has already done and I am sure Finland will do too – a series of political initiatives for 2007 involving the 450 million Europeans that are all too often forgotten about."
"Parliament must, and I am sure that it will, play its part as leader."
"The Romans used to say , nothing is difficult for those who want it."
"We want a political Europe, a Europe of values, a Europe of the people, a Europe of subsidiarity, a Europe of solidarity and a Europe of freedom."
"Mr President, we cannot allow ourselves to fail this challenge."
"Mr President, as well as Euro-pessimism, another spectre haunts Europe: that of autism and its associated hypocrisy and myths."
"That spectre fuels the one you mentioned."
"I too understand the attachment to the Constitutional Treaty on the part of those Member States that ratified it and of the majority of MEPs."
"Like all those who campaigned for it to be ratified – and I was one of them in France – I remain convinced that it contains some crucial advances with regard to the functioning and the democratic life of the Union."
"However, we must dispel the myth that, in time, it will be possible to present the same text, accompanied by a simple annex, in the countries in which it was rejected."
"We must also do away with the hypocrisy of the Member States that have so far been unable to ratify it and that, in actual fact, are quite simply unable to secure a majority, particularly when the people have been promised a referendum."
"I believe that we need instead to acknowledge this and to try to forge ahead, as you proposed just now, Mr Barroso, because European life cannot be founded on regrets."
"We need a revival, advances and progress."
"This revival – – and on this point too, I agree with you – – cannot be limited to the debate on the institutions."
"It hinges on policies."
"It hinges on the Europe of projects, on the Europe of growth and knowledge, and on the Europe of research, of energy and of cooperation in the Mediterranean."
"As regards the institutions, desperately wanting to keep the Treaty as it stands may not be the best way of saving its substance."
"I think that the period of reflection – – which the Council appears to be spending its time extending – is, rather, in danger of preserving the Treaty in aspic."
"I believe, in fact, that this exercise will soon reach its limits and that we must instead prepare to go beyond it by proposing a new road map."
"In order to go beyond it, we will need to do what your predecessor, the current Italian Prime Minister, said yesterday and draft a new and simpler text, which permits limited, but crucial, reforms."
"As for these reforms, they should be clear and easily understood by Europeans and should mainly focus on improving the democratic functioning of the Union and on clarifying the responsibilities among the institutions."
"Which reforms?"
"I will mention six of them, and I believe that we should more or less stop there."
"Firstly, to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, whose legitimacy is being recognised more and more by Europeans."
"Secondly, to make the Council's work more transparent when it debates legislative matters, as it is unacceptable that France and the United Kingdom should now place obstacles in the way of this transparency."
"Thirdly, to ensure that the appointment of the President of the Commission is made by taking into account the votes cast by Europeans during the European elections."
"Fourthly, to implement a power whereby the national parliaments can monitor compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Fifthly, to review the rules on qualified majority voting on the basis of what was agreed in the Treaty of 2004, in such a way that they are based on the population."
"Finally, in fact, to bring in a foreign affairs minister."
"The Member States have already given their backing to all of these ideas."
"I am convinced that, in all of our countries, the majority of people would be willing to support these reforms."
"We need initiatives."
"Let us attach importance to the substance rather than to the form."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Zeus should declare his feelings for his lover Europa: that was my plea six months ago at the start of the Austrian Council Presidency."
"His wife at home must be blind if she cannot see that there is quite some activity outside the marital home."
"A great deal of pomp and flashing lights, a great deal of silver and porcelain, distinguished guests, one important engagement after another, and now even a meeting with George W. Bush."
"There is never a dull moment with Europa."
"What kind of a figure does this Europa cut on the international stage, however?"
"Is she a strong, self-confident woman with the support of those around her, a woman who we believe to be capable of guiding us safely through difficult times?"
"Do we believe in Europa, or do we see a figure plagued with self-doubt, who does not know her role in this society, in this network of connections between individual countries?"
"What is it we want from Europa?"
"What do we expect of her?"
"We certainly have a clear idea."
"We believe that Europa should protect us from poverty, should provide security, should ensure that we do not have to live from hand to mouth, but instead are able to put something aside both now and in the future, should not let others treat her like a child in the global village, and should set an example."
"Expectations of Europe run high, but we do not believe it capable of meeting any of them."
"This explains the great scepticism that registers on the Eurobarometer."
"At the present time, Europe is completely incapable of meeting the expectations of the public – the Council gives it far too little scope to do so, and the Commission keeps it occupied with tasks that increasingly alienate it from the European public."
"No one understands Europe."
"What does it spend all its time doing anyway?"
"The essentials remain undone – that message, at least, is conveyed – and so discontent grows."
"Europe urgently needs a new master plan with projects focused on the citizen."
"It needs to become less ponderous, needs to develop an image."
"This is impossible when the Council Presidency rotates biannually."
"One goes, another takes its place; this is a ‘halfway house’, not a safe home."
"I know that things would be different if we had the Constitution."
"This will not be the case in 2007, however – and so I ask that the Summit produce clear competences and greater efficiency for Europe."
"If it does this, even the public will give the green light for the Constitution."
"Mr President, typical statements contained in the Presidency’s draft conclusions concern the EU’s need to listen to people and need to conduct a dialogue with them."
"Statements of both these kinds envisage a situation involving two parties."
"Who, then, are the parties that in some sense confront each other?"
"Curiously enough, it is the people of Europe and the establishment."
"This means that political representatives do not in practice see themselves as representatives of the people but as a group or establishment in opposition to the people."
"That is very unfortunate."
"That is why we are always so surprised and shaken at the results of our occasional referendums in Europe."
"The European party structure is completely out of date."
"Europeans cannot vote for their own parties and, at the same time, communicate their deep euroscepticism."
"That is something we must change in the future so that we do not continue with this undignified game."
"An establishment must listen to the people and be prepared to conduct a dialogue with them."
"The establishment must represent the people."
"Mr President, I have the growing impression that the discussion on the future of Europe has reached a dead end."
"It is like the obstruction of a blood vessel which supplies the heart with blood."
"If this situation continues, there is a risk of an extremely serious and extensive stroke."
"I have the impression that the discussion on the Constitutional Treaty is precisely such an obstruction."
"I am someone who supported the Constitutional Treaty and who still supports it."
"I nevertheless lamented the fact that, as a result of the ambitions of certain politicians, it came to be known as the European Constitution, which led from a pragmatic discussion of what should be included in the treaty to a referendum for or against the European Union."
"Although I lamented this label and these ambitions, I also acknowledged that such a treaty was necessary."
"Today, it should be very clearly stated that this state of affairs is untenable."
"It is not possible to vote again on the same document in these countries."
"I appeal to you to remove this obstruction, allowing fresh blood to reach the heart, so that we may deal with serious problems such as the real liberalisation of the European economy, something which still has not taken place."
"Mr President, one of the subjects for the forthcoming Summit is the attempt to define the European Union’s exact absorption capacity with regards to potential new members."
"Further enlargement of the European Union depends on this definition."
"It will be an important debate as this definition should not be the key which closes the future path to membership for the European Union’s most important neighbours."
"Fear of enlargement provides bad counsel."
"We should, of course, aim to define the geographical borders of the European Community, but we also should remember that we are bound by clearly defined criteria that are supposed to be met by potential candidates for European Union membership."
"We have to remember that the Union is an attractive project which gives hope to millions of our neighbours: Belarusians and Ukrainians."
"Today, in Belarus, we support civil society."
"The current dictatorship, backed by Russia, makes it impossible to pursue any other policy."
"However, the Union should pay particular attention to defining clear European prospects for Ukraine."
"The behaviour of the Kiev Government when attempts were made to use energy as a tool for blackmail in December, its solidarity with Moldova, for example the close monitoring of the Transnistria region and its good relations with Georgia show that Ukraine can be a real stabilising force in the region and can guarantee the growth of democracy."
"It is an invaluable ally for the European Union."
"I will now move on to the second issue related to the European Summit, which is the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency."
"This is supposed to be an important institution whose work should support respect for human rights."
"However, I would like to express my concern about the fact that there are attempts to limit its scope to activities in the Member States of the European Union."
"The historic mission of the Union is that of supporting and promoting democratic ideas and governments."
"Worldwide, many threats still exist outside the European Union."
"That is why the setting up of a Fundamental Rights Agency should be used to send a clear message to the global public that the Union possesses an effective instrument to support all those who fight for human rights and basic democratic freedoms."
"That is why I appeal for the activities of the Agency not to be limited to the territories of the 25 Member States."
"The Agency needs to act in other countries as well, most importantly those which are covered by the European Union neighbourhood policy or by partnership agreements, as is the case with Russia."
"Mr President, there is an old saying that if you do not fight, you do not count."
"Mr Barroso, I like to see you fighting."
"I recognise that you are fighting for a new treaty."
"I also like to see Commissioner Wallström fighting – you make a nice couple when you are fighting."
"Let me tell you that we really need to fight now."
"What is going on in the Council?"
"I know what is going on: maybe one day, through informal contacts behind closed doors, we will get a new treaty, as Mrs Wallström said today, but that was the old way of doing things."
"Now we need to do it together with the people."
"If we do not have the people with us, we will not have a new treaty."
"That is why I am so happy to see that we together – Parliament, the European parties and the Commission – can have a true European debate with ordinary people."
"Excuse me for saying so, but it is a hell of a job, because it takes time and energy and often you get very little thanks for it."
"However, at the end you will make a difference in history, because the result will be a new treaty."
"Therefore I just have two pieces of advice to give you."
"Firstly, we, together with the chairman of the group, have focused on the following issues."
"We cannot do more to resolve international conflicts, especially in the Middle East, without a new treaty."
"We cannot create more and better jobs and ensure better economic cooperation without a new treaty."
"We cannot combat terrorism, trafficking and cross-border crime without a new treaty."
"We need a new treaty in order to have low energy prices."
"We need a new treaty to have greater transparency."
"Therefore, Mr Barroso, I recommend that you work harder, as you have said, on this declaration next year."
"However, promise me that one of the major messages in that declaration next year will be that this European Union is not a competition amongst states, because that is what people increasingly fear."
"They fear uncertainty and financial competition on lowering taxes, a sort of social dumping, thereby undermining the welfare state."
"This European Union is a transparent and fair competition in the free market between firms, services and projects, which can contribute to our wealth."
"That is a very important signal to send out."
"The European Union is about people: putting people first, combining a new welfare state and a modernised version, for this region’s prosperity."
"My last point is that we need Bulgaria and Romania."
"We need to have a clear signal, President-in-Office, when you meet the day after tomorrow."
"We will meet in Brussels, with our leaders and prime ministers, and our message will be clear: we need Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2007."
"They deserve it and Europe needs them."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make three brief comments."
"First, I do wonder, when we hold our debates here in Strasbourg, whether we should really be setting up the Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna in competition to the Council of Europe, a tried and tested instrument that is able to take on this task not only for the EU Member States but far beyond our borders."
"I can really only encourage you, as I have also said to Chancellor Schüssel in a debate, to make an active contribution to treating the European disease of 'agencyitis' effectively."
"You could also send out a clear signal from your own country in that connection."
"Secondly – and in this I almost completely agree with what Mr Rasmussen said before me – we obviously also need to defend our own values in the context of the enlargement negotiations."
"I am rather worried that we are falling back into the mechanical behaviour that we have been experiencing here for the past 10 years and that we have criticised time and again in this forum."
"Was it really necessary to negotiate a chapter with Turkey on Monday, despite the fact that some of the minimum conditions, specifically recognition of the Ankara Protocol, have not even been dealt with yet?"
"I wonder whether we are perhaps once again sending out the wrong signals by setting in motion a train that, 10, 12 or however many years down the track, we will still not be able to stop."
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council could have sent out a clearer signal in this regard, too."
"Thirdly, the European Union is founded on the Member States."
"There is no single European people – and this goes for Mrs Wallström, too, who is now not listening – but 25 national peoples, as we are seeing at the moment with the football."
"And we have a European Union that is founded on the Member States and not on a majority of the population expressing their opinions in referendums."
"That really does need to be taken into account, otherwise this project will ultimately founder."
"Mr President, we complain that, in spite of our successes and achievements during 50 years of European integration, the European Union has become stuck in a rut."
"We complain that it lacks a clear vision, that there is no agreement on what direction to take and what to do in the future."
"However, we should admit that these criticisms and reservations expressed by the citizens are related to the current functioning of EU politics rather than the Constitutional Treaty, whose significance has not been sufficiently explained to the public."
"After all, the European Constitution is a fundamental document which will allow the Union to deal with new challenges."
"We are all aware that the Union cannot develop further on the basis of the existing Treaties, and not because these Treaties are ‘too restrictive’ for 25 or more Member States."
"These Treaties have a basic flaw in that they do not provide for the involvement of civil society either in shaping Union policies or in the decision-making process."
"President Barroso, I would like to ask how many millions of signatures we would need to collect today, as part of a citizens’ initiative, in order for the Commission to hear the voice of the citizens."
"At the moment you are not obliged to take account of their voice, but the Constitutional Treaty would give the citizens the opportunity to set up such an initiative and one million signatures would be enough."
"I repeat, one million out of 457 million European Union citizens would be needed to set up such an initiative."
"Does this mean nothing to opponents of the Constitutional Treaty who bandy democratic slogans about so enthusiastically?"
"President Barroso, it is with pleasure that I heard your declaration on the Constitution today."
"However, these words must be backed up with actions and the most important task at the moment is to win back the trust of the citizens of Europe in the European project."
"We have to do this in the old Union where Europe has become very commonplace because the citizens have had it for too long and also take advantage of pro-European feeling, or rather enthusiasm, in the new Member States."
"In my country, Poland, 80% of citizens want more Europe and 60% want a Constitutional Treaty."
"This is a good sign and I hope that during the European Summit these countries will make the right decisions, showing the way for Europe and the place of the Constitutional Treaty, so that we may overcome this impasse."
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Commission, you have made a good speech today and I would like to congratulate you on it."
"You have made a good speech, because I believe that you have managed to move people, those of us who are here and those outside of this Parliament who are listening to us."
"You have argued that we should not allow ourselves to indulge in Euro-pessimism and I believe that you are right."
"You have also said something very important: that Europe is not in crisis."
"It is true. Europe is not in crisis."
"We must not allow ourselves to believe that."
"It is also the case, however, that we must make an effort to explain why the Constitutional Treaty is important to people’s lives, because many people take the view that the Constitutional Treaty has not entered into force – which is the case – but nothing has gone wrong as a result;"
"Europe has not fallen into the sea."
"Many people are therefore tempted to say that the Constitutional Treaty is not so important, since nothing has gone wrong despite it not having entered into force."
"In all of the campaigns that I have taken part in, I have never heard what all of the leaders who have spoken here today have said: the Constitutional Treaty is necessary in order for Europe to function better, in order to provide the people with added value."
"We must make a huge educational effort to explain to the people what I have previously called ‘the cost of not having a Constitution’: why not having a Constitutional Treaty has a negative impact on their daily lives."
"As Mr Rasmussen has said, explaining these things is a tough task; it is a task that requires a great intellectual effort."
"We must apply our grey matter, in order to explain it to the people through clear and relevant examples, but it is a necessary task."
"I believe that Europe requires a huge amount of education today, but it also requires a degree of calm, a degree of political skill, and I believe that this Parliament, which has been a pioneer on many other occasions, through the Resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that we are going to approve today, indicates that direction."
"Through a lot of education, I believe that we will be able to rescue the ship of the Constitution, get it back afloat, and ensure that the Constitutional Treaty provides the people with added value."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, Mr Barroso, that, during next Friday's Summit, you must go against what was claimed in Klosterneuburg and argue that the problem is not one of extending the period of reflection on the institutional issue, but rather of making swift progress both in improving and ratifying the European Constitution and regarding policies capable of improving Europe’s image among Europeans."
"In fact, if the two countries that failed to ratify the Constitution did so for reasons quite different to those regarding the constitutional text, then it is really a question of moving more quickly on practical policies capable of changing Europe’s image for the better."
"In order to do this, however, we need to go beyond the period of reflection on the institutional issue as quickly as possible."
"The constraints that we come up against in implementing the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world are, in fact, mainly due to the intergovernmental, rather than Community, approach."
"There can be no single currency without common economic and social policies and without a genuine form of socio-economic governance."
"We must therefore clearly state that social and economic problems are resolved by a form of institution building that is in keeping with the Community approach."
"If we do not want to destroy Europe, then we must state, as Mr Schulz did, that Europe needs the Constitution immediately."
"Mr President, the Euro-pessimism that President Barroso spoke about seems to be a much more contagious disease than avian flu."
"It is serious, because it provides a good excuse for many political leaders not to face the challenges of changing Europe."
"If it continues in this way, this situation will remind me more and more of the old Soviet joke from the 1970s: the Soviet economy was in stalemate and the train was not moving, so the order was given to draw the curtains, rock the carriage to and fro and pretend the train was moving at high speed."
"Clearly we need a political solution, not in the form of first division and second division Europe, but with a new quality of political leadership that would be worthy of the founding fathers 50 years ago."
"Can we really restore trust and generate inspiration among the voters if we continue to conduct our policies from one national election to another, finding in them a good excuse not to apply the common policies?"
"I think people can easily differentiate between far-sighted, compassionate and courageous leadership and the petty and patronising approach of those whose main aim is to retain control of the situation."
"If the name of the Constitution is an obstacle, then I am prepared to change the name."
"We could streamline the format, but we need to retain the substance of the Constitution, otherwise we cannot successfully apply the common policies of enlarged Europe."
"We cannot apply the solidarity which is a guiding principle of all our efforts."
"– Mr President, I shall talk about the PNR agreement with the United States, which the European Court of Justice has rejected, and about the framework decision on data protection, which unfortunately the European Council rejects every day by default."
"My specific proposal is this: firstly, that if you go ahead and renew the PNR agreement on the basis of the third pillar, you only do so until 2007."
"Secondly, that you then negotiate with Parliament changes to this agreement which safeguard fundamental rights and that you do so by applying the clause at long last."
"Thirdly, that you proceed throughout in cooperation with the European Parliament and in a serious tripartite dialogue and, fourthly, that you immediately adopt the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar."
"We shall be voting on Parliament's proposal today."
"It is a very serious proposal and it is time you started working on it."
"Keep the promises of the Danish Presidency to the European Parliament and pass it because, if you do not, I worry that the European Parliament will be forced to halt other important activities, even though they require first and foremost a European law for the protection of rights."
"Mr President, Parliament has been a consistent supporter of enlargement and, in particular, the timely accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"I trust, therefore, that the European Council this week will confirm its commitment to the accession date of 1 January 2007 for those countries."
"As the rapporteur for Bulgaria over the past six years, I have seen at first hand the progress that has been made in transforming the economy, the political system and the administrative structures of that country."
"Above all there has been a change in attitudes and expectations."
"People want a better life and now believe that it is achievable."
"It is most important that we do nothing to undermine that confidence and the duty to the people of Bulgaria that we share with the Bulgarian authorities."
"The resolution of Parliament makes clear that some concrete results are needed in the coming months."
"Those are primarily the responsibility of the Bulgarian Government, but the Commission and the Member States must do all they can to help."
"I know that the United Kingdom and some other countries have already provided assistance in the fight against organised crime."
"I would ask for a reinforcement of that effort during the next four months."
"Turning to other matters, the European Union is very good at giving lessons to others, but often fails to learn lessons itself."
"We have heard much about the ‘period of reflection’ following the failure of the Constitution, but we seem incapable of drawing the right conclusions."
"The answer that we hear this morning is ‘more Europe’."
"I do not know where that is coming from."
"It is not what I hear from the people of East Anglia that I represent."
"They want less interference from Brussels and they want the European Union to put its House in order and to carry out a more limited range of tasks with greater efficiency."
"People want more control over their own lives."
"They want accountable national and local government; they want security and prosperity and they want a Europe that differs from the outmoded project that unfortunately is still on the table."
"Mr President, those who claim – on one side of the House, notably – that the French and Dutch have said ‘no’ and that this whole debate must therefore come to an end and we should never again consider changing the treaties are guilty of being far too simplistic and of only wanting to hear one answer."
"When they say, as one of them did, ‘which part of the word ‘no’ do you not understand owing to the French and Dutch results?’, we could easily turn round and say ‘which part of the word ‘yes’ do not understand from the 16 to 18 – if you include Romania and Bulgaria – other countries that have said ‘yes’ to this constitution?’"
"We are not faced with an issue of overwhelming rejection or of overwhelming acceptance, but we are facing a problem of divergence."
"And what do we do in the Union when there is a problem of divergence?"
"We sit down, talk it through and try to find a solution acceptable to everyone."
"That is how we make progress."
"That is why it is right to take the time to have this period of reflection and to prolong it and look at what is possible."
"It is also right to address not just the question of the text, but also the context – , the Hampton Court agenda, the issues that are close to people – and then, in due course, in a new context, we can decide what to do about the text."
"Make no mistake about it: we will have to decide what to do about the text."
"The issues that Treaty was intended to address have not disappeared."
"They have not vanished overnight and need solving."
"We will have to return to these issues, and it is quite correct to orient the period of reflection towards them."
"It may be that in a year’s time and in a new context it will be possible to retain this text as it stands, or with certain additions clarifying it, or with interpretations, or with additional protocols, or by rewriting Part 3, as some have suggested."
"It may also be that this is not possible and it has to be broken up."
"The conclusion may be that we will have to live with the existing Treaties for ever more because it is now impossible to change them."
"However, all this will emerge in due course."
"Now is not the time to make that choice."
"Now is not the time to say that we need to rewrite the text."
"We will take that decision at the end of the period of reflection, and rightly so."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands, it is high time for Europe to pull itself together and to put forward some solutions to make the most of the content of its draft European Constitution."
"Our Heads of State or Government will need to discuss some key issues for our future: energy independence, immigration, the future of the Constitutional Treaty and enlargement."
"On each of those subjects, Europeans expect their leaders to give real answers and to have the courage to accept both the political and financial consequences of those answers."
"The humanitarian situation amongst the immigrants flocking to the southern shores of the EU needs to form one of Europe's highest priorities, and it calls for a joint response in terms of reception of immigrants and asylum policy."
"It also demonstrates the need for an in-depth re-examination of our development policy, which is evidently failing to meet the urgent needs of people in countries that we want, but are not managing, to help."
"With regard to enlargement, I welcome the European Commission's wisdom in deciding to postpone the decision on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria until next October, depending on the progress achieved by each of those countries."
"However, the Commission also needs to show similar perceptiveness with regard to Turkey."
"I am very critical of the very positive signals just given to that country in the context of the accession negotiations, at a time when it still does not recognise Cyprus, one of the Members of the Union it wants to join."
"Europe can only be strong if it is respected, and it will only be respected if it applies the same legal rules to all."
"Finally, I would like to remind you that the criterion of absorption capacity has not simply been invented by certain Member States, but is one of the Copenhagen criteria."
"We will be fooling the candidate countries if we lead them to believe that we are doing them a favour by allowing them to join a Union that is not in full working order."
"We would be deceiving both the people of the current Member States and those of the countries that are working so hard to join the European Union."
"Mr President, we are talking about the period of reflection and debate on the future of Europe, but given what we are discussing this morning, I believe that this a debate on the present of the European Union."
"The future and the present become fused, particularly because it is essential to implement a Constitution in order to resolve the problems facing us today."
"In that regard, I believe that it is essential that the Commission take account of the point in our resolution calling upon it to produce a report on the cost of not having a Constitution."
"That is essential."
"I would ask for even more: for the Commission to commit itself, Mr Barroso, to present that report to this House and to the Council immediately after the summer, in September or October, so that we can hold a debate with the citizens specifically about how, with the Constitution not in force, we can resolve issues such as illegal immigration, which has been discussed here."
"We must continue with the process of ratification and eventually find a solution that can unblock it, but on the basis of this text, which is a good text: it is a text based on a consensus."
"I believe that that is the objective of the European Parliament’s resolution."
"I have just one request for you, Mr Barroso: I have been happy to applaud you today;"
"I can tell you quite honestly that this is the first time I have done so."
"If you express the same arguments outside of this House, I shall continue to do so."
"Mr President, I too agree that measures should be taken to bring the European Union closer to the citizens."
"I therefore support that Europe of results that the President, Mr Barroso, has mentioned today."
"The failure of the referendums in France and the Netherlands did not just reflect domestic political issues, but also the fact that some citizens do not sufficiently understand or value the process of European construction."
"We must increase the citizens’ faith in the Union, show them its added value, through more effective action on issues such as security, the effective control of migratory flows, job creation and so on. These are issues to which the European Council must pay the greatest possible attention."
"We must also better explain how the Union operates and the objectives it pursues."
"A few days ago, in Aachen, Prime Minister Juncker proposed that young Europeans should visit the war cemeteries so that new generations could fully appreciate the contribution that the Union makes to peace on a continent that has been so blood-stained by past wars."
"I believe that the Union should also have a place in colleges and schools."
"As the Chairman of my party, Mariano Rajoy, proposed a few months ago in Paris, a specific obligatory subject should be created in all colleges and schools in the Member States, which would cover the origin, the objectives and the operation of the European Union's institutions."
"That kind of education aimed at young people is very important."
"We must also explain another great success: the enlargement processes."
"We must stress that the prospect of accession has been a powerful driving force in terms of the great political, economic and social transformations that have taken place in many countries, which have benefited both them and the Union."
"I would like to end by referring to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, a resolution on which we shall approve today."
"In recent times, these countries have been making spectacular progress in many areas."
"They are undergoing those great transformations that I mentioned just now, and in particular I would like to stress the progress that Romania has made in areas such as the reform of the justice system and the fight against corruption."
"If they continue with these reforms, I am convinced that both countries will join the Union on 1 January 2007 and I am very pleased that the next European Council will encourage them to focus their efforts on achieving that common objective."
"Mr President, we need a Constitution in order to respond to the challenges which the new millennium has brought for cooperation."
"A Union of almost 30 countries cannot be successfully guided by rules established in the last millennium for a Community of what was originally six countries."
"A Constitutional Treaty will be a rational response to the challenges that the public have set for European cooperation."
"They have called for transparency in decision making, clarity in agreements and treaties, and power in matters which need to be dealt with together so that the measures taken are sufficiently effective."
"If our citizens are to be treated equally, each Member State must have a right and an obligation to decide independently whether to ratify the Constitution."
"Only then will it be time to draw conclusions on the future of the Treaty."
"As the next country to hold the presidency, Finland deserves our appreciation for implementing this principle."
"Mr President, I would like to make three points."
"The first point is that I think the speech made by Mr Barroso was excellent."
"Right now we are getting involved in this vicious circle of Euro-pessimism and what we need is a heavy-duty injection of Euro-optimism."
"We need to take a look at what we have achieved over the past 10 to 12 years and the results are overwhelming – everything from enlargement to justice and home affairs, CFSP, and, of course, the single currency."
"Sometimes we have a tendency to lose perspective."
"We must realise that the European Union is constant crisis management."
"We go from one little crisis to another, but I think the bigger picture is a success story."
"The second point I want to make is that right now I think we are facing a new generation of what I call ‘EU whingers’ or ‘EU whiners’."
"They are people, usually ministers, who go into a closed room, have a discussion, clap each other on the back and say ‘great decision’."
"Five minutes after that, they get into the blame game, go in front of their national media and say, ‘oh no, what an awful decision the EU has just made’."
"You cannot talk negatively about the European Union six days a week and then go to church on Sunday and say that the EU is a great thing."
"Perhaps this could be the reason why the UK Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett does not want to see much transparency, because then people would see that some of the British positions are actually pro-European."
"The final point I want to make is that we need a constitutional treaty."
"The problems are not going to go away and we have heard that in the debate today."
"We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights; we need a legal personality; we need a foreign minister; we need more qualified-majority voting and we need more codecision."
"So we need to fix it, and hopefully we can fix it before 2009."
"Deepening and widening go hand in hand."
"Nice is not enough."
"Mr President, I would like to mention three key issues regarding the enlargement of the European Union."
"The first issue is the consolidation of the current round of enlargement, that is, are we using the same standard when we decide to allow new Member States to enter the euro zone?"
"That is, is the European Union going to ensure that the conditions for the enlargement of the Schengen area are in place by next year as far as the European Union is concerned?"
"That is, are we going to create the Fundamental Rights Agency, which has already been adopted by the European Parliament, or are we going to sabotage it instead?"
"These are important questions at a time when we have seen that for instance, for the first time ever, we applied a sanction against the will of a Member State in the case of Lithuania, a Member State applying for entry in the euro zone."
"Why is a price stability policy desirable in the case of a country in the process of catching up?"
"Or should perhaps deflation be a term of reference in this case?"
"Also, was the perspective of a Maastricht criterion better in 1999 in an Italy indebted to the hilt, than it would be today in Vilnius?"
"Why are the ten new Member States lectured about inflation, through Lithuania, by those in whose countries the situation is progressively worsening, such as in the Spain of Mr Alumnia or the Luxembourg of Mr Juncker?"
"This is rightfully branded as a disgraceful approach by none other than one of the fathers of the euro, Professor Lámfalussy."
"And can the esteemed Council and Commission take the strategic political decision of not recommending admission, without Parliament, who is usually so proud of its privileges?"
"How is the same standard applied in this case?"
"Secondly, are we really going to wait for the assessment of the Commission in autumn, regarding the date and conditions of accession for Romania and Bulgaria, if we have already extracted this through an exchange of letters?"
"Are we preparing to rush the accession of countries that are falling dramatically behind current Member States, and even behind the ten new Member States, as regards their economic and social indicators and the level of corruption?"
"What kind of Europe is this going to be?"
"What is the vision here?"
"Will this society comply with and apply the law when it is part of the European Union?"
"In countries where, for instance, there is no registration of the Roma or of land ownership, or where there are tens of thousands of abandoned babies?"
"And what about the largest indigenous national minority, the millions of Hungarian speakers?"
"Why do we not take a look, as regards this case, at our own Copenhagen statements about minorities, made in 1993, or at previous Parliament and Commission presentations, where minority rights and democracy used to have equal standing?"
"Thirdly, we must also address the standard and speed of individual negotiations."
"When are we going to admit, in the course of enlargement negotiations, that the level of preparedness and European integration of Croatia is outstanding, and that it would present fewer absorption problems than, for instance, Turkey?"
"Without consistency and the use of the same standard, the prestige of the European Union will remain low, and it is clearly visible that by the unhurried building of the two-phase integration, it takes back everything that it has had to spend on the enlargement of the EU."
"This is the real, but negative item."
"Mr President, I wish I was making this speech in a Parliament based in Brussels rather than in this Chamber, since the ongoing Strasbourg circus, now exacerbated by financial scandal, brings our House into disrepute."
"I welcome, of course, the fact that Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the European Union in 2007, even if there are still issues to be resolved, such as the system – or lack of a system – for the protection of children in Romania, and the level of organised crime in Bulgaria."
"However, delaying their admission by one more year would serve no purpose other than to send the wrong signal to their peoples and governments."
"On the vexed issue of what to do about the EU Constitution, I agree with those who say it is dead in its current format."
"Nevertheless, even those of us opposed in principle to a constitution, with a foreign minister, permanent president and binding charter of fundamental rights, accept there is a need for treaty adjustment in order to accommodate future enlargement beyond the Nice formula and to settle the increasing imbalance between small and large Member States in terms of voting rights in the institutions."
"This matter can only get worse with the proliferation of mini-States in the western Balkans – as recently seen with the independence of Montenegro – all of which are likely to become full Members in the next ten years."
"I would also be in favour of retrieving the proposed powers to increase the influence of national parliaments and of more transparency in the co-legislative process in the Council of Ministers, whose current behaviour is far too secretive."
"That is why I particularly deplore the U-turn by the British Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, which completely contradicts both the views of her Prime Minister and the general thrust of reform and transparency in the European Union."
"It is deeply regrettable that the British Government, unlike its Danish partner, is not cross-examined or mandated in the House of Commons before deciding on its voting position in the Council of Ministers."
"The whole process of framing legislation would be empowered, both in the House of Commons and for the British people, if UK ministers went before the House of Commons and were asked which way they were going to vote in the Council of Ministers and then did so in a totally transparent and open fashion."
"I would therefore say ‘no’ to Mrs Beckett on her views on transparency in the Council of Ministers."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in view of the integration problems we are now experiencing in many EU Member States, and in view of the population trends and the huge problems we are having with illegal immigration and the associated problems of organised crime and trafficking, I welcome the fact that you want to put the focus of the forthcoming European Council on migration."
"We need to be quite clear about this: if we want to avoid conflicts in the European Union in the long term, we must manage the influx of economic migrants, taking particular account of the assimilation and integration capacities of our Member States."
"We must finally create a European asylum policy, and in this connection I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council, which has undertaken a great deal of preliminary work to ensure that refugees can be aided quickly, whilst at the same time preventing economic migration using asylum certificates and abuse of the asylum system."
"We must also focus on combating illegal immigration and human trafficking, which, as I just said, are elements of organised crime."
"This cannot be solved by regularisation, as we are currently experiencing once again in Spain: regularisation produces a suction effect, with all of the dramatic results and tragedies that brings with it."
"What we need is a comprehensive strategy that must include the following elements: aid in the countries of origin, information campaigns via the mass media – including in the countries of origin – explaining the consequences of illegal immigration, and the establishment of a common external border protection mechanism using the visa information system, the Schengen information system and EURODAC, so that we can achieve the objective of maintaining the stability and security of the European Union over the long term."
"– Mr President, first of all my warmest congratulations to the Austrian Presidency on the work which it carried out and on the fact that it put the European Constitution back into the limelight during its six- month term of office."
"My warmest congratulations also to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, on the historic speech which he gave in the European Parliament today."
"Mr Barroso restated the European vision today and revived our hopes for the future of Europe."
"Well done, Mr Barroso."
"Ladies and gentlemen, globalisation has given rise to numerous challenges, numerous problems and numerous pressures in the European Union: economic pressures, political pressures, inflationary pressures and all kinds of challenges."
"If it is to be able to meet the challenges of globalisation, it has no choice but to 'constitutionalise' the Union."
"Europe cannot function as it is functioning today and be expected to be in a position to address these problems."
"No Member State can meet the challenges of globalisation alone."
"That is why those talking with because the Constitution is dead need to tell us how they will meet these challenges under the present circumstances."
"Europe needs to enhance its credibility and face up to the problems as best it can; this will then provide the basis for supporting the Constitution and defending it to the citizens."
"This is our job, the job of all the institutions."
"The various Member States need to stop passing the buck to the European Union and, where they stand to benefit, claiming national successes."
"Finally, talking about credibility, I must say that it is not in Europe's interest to negotiate with Turkey, which does not recognise one of the twenty-five Member States and is occupying European territory."
"It is not in Europe's interest to be lax towards this country, while we have done everything we can to be strict in our judgment of Bulgaria and Romania."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members, at the start of this debate, Mr Schulz told us that, along with the President of the Commission, Mr Leinen was one of the most important people in Europe."
"I can absolutely go along with that, if we add the President-in-Office of the Council to the list: it is indeed true."
"This public debate that Mr Corbett wanted, and the debates that have taken place in this House over the last few months – I would remind you of the highly constructive report from Mr Voggenhuber, the discussions in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and the discussions you have held here today – are actually taking place, and, when he says 'we must talk it through', I absolutely agree with him."
"A very important debate has been held here today, and it is also going to influence the discussions of the Heads of State or Government, because it is important for Europe."
"The President of the Commission has very clearly stated, just as I and many of you have, that we need to walk on both legs, that we need to continue with this twin-track approach of both producing concrete results and actions for our citizens and discussing the future of Europe and the future of a Constitutional Treaty."
"I think this is essential, and it is a result that I will take away with me and report to the President of the Council in this form."
"Mr Poettering and others have mentioned the Fundamental Rights Agency."
"I would just like to go into that very briefly, because it is a subject very close to my heart, and I have the impression that there are some misunderstandings in this regard."
"It is very much a matter of the European Union as a community of values, and as a union that defends human rights and stands up for them to the outside world, having an institution that can and does stand up for those values."
"We think that this human rights agency would be a worthwhile institution, and, of course, that it would not compete in any way with the Council of Europe or any other institutions."
"I really would ask you to take a close look at the proposals on the table, because it is precisely this competition that we are trying to exclude."
"Mr Schulz also talked about human rights, about the issue of Guantánamo Bay, about shared values, and about the CIA."
"It goes without saying that we also need to make these shared values clear to our partners and our friends."
"The Council, many Member States and the President-in-Office of the Council have all made that very clear, and, of course, it will also be an important subject at the forthcoming Summit with the United States."
"Mrs Frassoni and a number of others – to whom I am very grateful, because this was an important issue for the Austrian Presidency – mentioned transparency."
"We hope that we will be able to produce a good package at the European Council."
"There are indeed one or two other difficulties that we hope we will be able to overcome, for this is another topic which we agree with Parliament is very important to the people."
"Mrs Frassoni also said that we have not been precise enough with regard to the relaxation of visa rules for the Balkan countries."
"I would like to stress once again that we do, of course, have a very precise plan for issuing a mandate and that the Council's conclusions will also state that these negotiations will be concluded within the next year."
"We know that this is extremely important for the countries in the Balkans."
"Mr Voggenhuber, I cannot agree with you that, over the last few months, the Austrian Presidency has been holding these debates behind closed doors with experts and elites."
"We have made a great deal of effort."
"Perhaps we have not always been successful, but we have made considerable efforts to go out and talk to school children, students and the people on the streets in all kinds of formats and formations."
"That is very important: we have tried very hard to do that, and I am sure that future Presidencies will do the same."
"Mr Galeote referred to immigration, and in this domain, too, we are trying to achieve some very real results."
"In future, we will also need to look into the issue of a list of safe third countries, and, of course, we also need a joint asylum policy."
"There are a huge number of issues on which we need to work with our partners in Europe to draft a policy that is in everyone's interests."
"The issue of minorities has also been brought up, and, on that subject, let me say that this was a particularly important point that the Austrian Presidency has also tried to address."
"Mrs Resetarits once again talked about Zeus and Europa."
"Europa was not just the lover of Zeus: she also had a family with him – they had three children."
"Of course this family had arguments, but, as far as we know, they lived happily together, and I think that should serve as an example to us."
"If I understood Mr Ferber correctly, he said that there are 25 peoples, and he related this to the football World Cup."
"If I may interpret this as a suggestion that all 25 or 27 countries should, in future, still be able to compete in the European Football Championships, then I, as an Austrian, can only welcome that, because then we would finally be able to participate again."
"."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I really think that this has been one of the most interesting debates I have participated in so far at the European Parliament."
"Above and beyond the various points of view expressed, I have detected a real desire to push forward our European project and I have seen that there is a real interest in rallying together, in uniting: uniting the institutions, and also, because we need their support, uniting the Member States and the citizens of Europe."
"We need to unite the three institutions because, let us be quite clear about this, we need all three institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"If the Constitutional Treaty had depended solely on the European Parliament and the Commission, it would already be in place, because the Commission adopted it unanimously and a very large majority of the European Parliament supported it."
"However, we also need to be able to count on all the Member States, and, at the moment, not all of the Member States are with us."
"That is why, if we really want to deal with this issue, we need to achieve a blend of ambition and realism."
"We need to rally together all the Member States."
"That being the case, as Mr Rasmussen and others have already said, and as Mrs Wallström reminded us, it is not now enough, if we want Europe to make progress, to ask our diplomats to hold a meeting in a beautiful location to find the solution."
"These days, we need to involve the citizens."
"Thinking back to the past, I sometimes wonder whether the single market or the single currency, all the progress we have made, could ever have been achieved if we had had a referendum at each stage."
"These days, if we want to move Europe forward, we need to do it with our citizens, which, it is true, is why things are much more complicated now."
"True, it is much more difficult now, and it is going to take time, but it is absolutely essential: if we want Europe to make progress, we must make the effort to get all Europeans involved, and, to do that, we need to unite the European camp."
"That is why I made this comment in my introductory remarks: we must not add to the traditional Euroscepticism of those who never wanted Europe the Euro-pessimism of those who want to move Europe forwards."
"True, the various big European political families may express differing positions, but as soon as we agree on the need to push forward with our European project, we must be able to unite our camp to send a positive, confident message."
"Those of us in this House today do not simply have the job of providing a commentary: of course, we can, and indeed must, analyse the situation, but the job of a leader, of a political representative, is to inspire confidence and hope."
"That is why I think it is essential to have a programme that is able to unite the people around real results, and around projects with the aim of consolidating the great European project."
"We could point to many of these results, and I am delighted at the energy with which the Austrian Presidency is working to achieve concrete results."
"Indeed, we must say quite clearly that the Member States, who want aims, who want objectives, also need to give us the resources."
"Very often, all the Member States agree, one day, that we need to do more at European level in terms of security and justice."
"All the Member States tell us we need to do more to combat illegal immigration and to manage legal immigration."
"All the Member States say we need greater cooperation."
"But then, when the Commission suggests transferring certain competences regarding justice and the police from the third pillar to the first, I still see no unanimity from the Member States concerning this project and the resources necessary to run it properly."
"The same applies to energy: today, there is consensus that we need a common energy policy, and a common strategy, but we need the resources to develop this common strategy."
"That is why, as Mr Goebbels, Mrs Frassoni and others have said, it is important to achieve concrete results in terms of energy efficiency and to have programmes for renewable energy, so that we can really translate the objectives from the Green Paper for safe and competitive sustainable energy into practice."
"The same applies to research."
"One of the most important things we learned at the Hampton Court Summit was, amongst other things, that we need to do more at European level in terms of research and development."
"That is why we put forward the idea of the European Institute of Technology as a flagship project to mobilise our efforts, and I hope that the Member States, who are in agreement on the objectives, will also be able to give us the resources to achieve them."
"I therefore think, Mr President, honourable Members, that the European Council needs to reach agreement on the path to go down."
"We must not simply extend the period of reflection, but move into a commitment period consisting in defining specific results for the near future in order to demonstrate the added value of Europe to our citizens, and at the same time to show them, as Mr Leinen, Mrs Méndez de Vigo and others have said, what it costs us not to have an institutional solution."
"We need an institutional solution, and that touches on the issue of enlargement, because the European debate very often sets those who favour enlargement against those who favour deepening."
"I continue to believe, as Mr Juncker and others have said, that we need both."
"In fact, enlargement is one of the fundamental reasons for deepening, one of the fundamental reasons that justify institutional reform: an enlarged Europe requires institutional reform as a matter of greater and greater urgency."
"The right answer to our current difficulties is not to divide Europe into first division countries and second division ones, but, on the contrary, to try to rally all the Member States together: both those who are already part of the enlarged Europe and those who are going to join us shortly."
"In this connection, I would also point out that we expect the next European Council to give a clear signal of its commitment to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 if those countries meet all the conditions we have set them, and which they have now been working for months to achieve."
"I hope that the Council will do that."
"Finally, as many of you, including Mr Stubb, have said, we need to keep things in perspective."
"I know that negative nostalgia is currently in fashion: oh, how wonderful Europe was 10 or 20 years ago."
"But, honestly, which Europe are we talking about?"
"Was it really better 20 years ago, when large parts of our continent were not free, when much of our continent was divided by regimes that were against freedom and democracy?"
"Was it really better 10 years ago, when the Balkans were the scene of bloody massacres?"
"Are the Balkans not part of our Europe, too?"
"Do we not want to extend the area of freedom and democracy to the Europeans in the Balkans?"
"That is why I do not share the depression or the pessimism: I think that, if you keep things in perspective, you will understand that Europe needs to move forward."
"It is true that Europe has its problems, and that the issue of the institutions is a considerable difficulty, but we must not wallow in this negativity, scepticism and cynicism that is currently so fashionable."
"We need to unite around common values, such as, I would emphasise, law."
"Some of you mentioned Guantánamo, and, indeed, we must say quite clearly that absolutely nothing justifies having, as part of the fight against terrorism, a vacuum in terms of respect for human rights."
"In such cases, Europe must stand up for its values and its convictions."
"So, let us be proud of Europe."
"Our partners in Latin America ask us: how did you pull it off?"
"We, too, are trying to advance regional integration – how did Europe manage it?"
"When we talk to our partners in Russia, China, India and elsewhere, they show great respect for an enlarged, powerful Europe."
"Let us be proud of Europe."
"Let us be proud of our values, and I think that, in showing this confidence and this spirit of togetherness, those of us who truly believe in European values will be in a position to resolve our current difficulties and to make progress with our project for Europe: a competitive, open Europe, but also a Europe founded on the idea of solidarity, a Europe that wants to master globalisation, not suffer it."
"That is our great project for Europe."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions(1) tabled to wind up the debate under Rules 103(2) and 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.30."
"– The statements delivered by the Commission and the Council are evidence that the next European Council will still fail to implement the much-needed measures to change what Mr Barroso has referred to as Europe’s ‘crisis culture’, and that they do not want to understand the causes of the criticisms voiced by citizens of the Member States."
"They sidestep the fact that the main reason for people's discontent is the current social crisis, which is dealt with only marginally in the proposed Council conclusions and postponed until a report is submitted by March 2007."
"The Council’s sole interest is to press ahead with liberalisations, the directive on completing the internal market in services and the common energy policy."
"The main priority is the constitutional issue, which the conclusions document also omits, but which was the central – and virtually the only – theme of the speech given by the President of the Commission."
"He stressed that the Commission believes we stand to lose by not moving the process forward, overlooking the fact that the democratic process led to the rejection of the European Constitution by the people of France and the Netherlands, which is something that the Community's institutions should respect."
"By announcing new forms of propaganda, including the proposed Declaration on Political Europe, to be submitted next year, which all of the Community's institutions are to sign, the Council is following a path that fails to address existing problems."
"The future of Europe is a very important matter."
"It is not true that a good European must be a federalist."
"We can be good Europeans without being enthusiastic about the Constitutional Treaty."
"Should the period of reflection be extended?"
"It certainly should, although we ought to make sure that this period is really used for reflection rather than for pleas, wishful thinking or creating the false impression that there is no alternative to the Treaty."
"An extended period of reflection should be used to consider what Europeans really want, how a balance can be achieved between the large and the small Member States, between the new and old Member States, between richer and poorer regions, between the desire to be competitive and the dogma of the European social model."
"This is not an easy task."
"I am concerned that we will not be able to resolve these issues if we limit our reflections to the existing text of the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is also important to be honest with Europeans."
"Are we sure they will accept European Union enlargement achieved at the cost of strengthening the political dominance of the largest states of the European Union?"
"Did all current EU Member States take part in drawing up the Constitutional Treaty on equal terms?"
"A lot has been said about Europe needing to be closer to its citizens, that it should be easier for them to understand."
"I hope that this wish also applies to the debate on the European Constitution."
"The European Union’s Constitutional Treaty projected ambitions which the Union has not been able to realise to date."
"The EU has failed in the strategy which was supposed to turn Europe into the world’s most competitive knowledge economy, in the cooperation to combat bird flu and in the implementation of common foreign policy."
"It is quite understandable that the people of Europe are questioning our aspiration of a fully-fledged Constitution if we cannot even manage to make sound agreements in all those other areas, or if we contravene the agreements that are in place, such as the Stability Pact."
"We should be more modest."
"Let us first carry out the institutional reforms that are really necessary."
"Those changes, described in Chapter 1 of the Constitutional Treaty of 2004, would then have the character of an ordinary treaty and would obviate the need for a referendum in each Member State."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must also become a treaty document in time."
"At the moment, it gives the current draft treaty its constitutional overtones precisely where the Union is not ready for them."
"I personally would have liked to have seen the direct election of the President of the European Commission included. In that way, though, we would at any rate solve the most urgent problems and support both the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"I should like to extend a warm welcome to Mr K.P. Sharma Oli, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, who has taken his seat in the distinguished visitors’ gallery."
"Mr Sharma Oli has held meetings with the chairmen of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development, and this afternoon will participate in a meeting with Parliament’s SAARC Delegation, whose chairwoman, Mrs Gill, is sitting here today in a wonderful shade of green."
"We are very pleased that Mr Sharma Oli has taken this opportunity to visit Parliament and to tell us about the most recent developments in Nepal."
"We trust that this visit will further enhance and develop relations between the European Parliament and Nepal."
"The next item is voting time."
". – Mr President, I must point out an error."
"The amendment deleting Article 14, which was adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, has not been included in the versions of the report for plenary, but the Tabling Office assured us that it would be inserted into the final version following the vote."
"I just wanted to draw your attention to that."
"– Very well, we will certainly take note of that."
". – Mr President, the intention of the oral amendment is to replace the word 'commitments' by the word 'agreements' in Article 8d(5)."
". – Mr President, this is a very important vote."
"The report has just been adopted by an overwhelming majority in plenary."
"The Commission has paid close attention to our work and has given us its support, as it reaffirmed yesterday evening."
"In contrast, we have received no support from the Council, which was absent from plenary during the debate on this report."
"I would note that it is once again absent and that we are still waiting for its opinion on the report."
"I would remind you that the Council made a moral commitment to this framework decision on data protection during the previous Presidency, and Parliament could feel betrayed if we did not have a firm commitment from the Council to adopt this framework decision by the autumn."
"I would remind you that this adoption is extremely urgent, in view of the Court of Justice's decision regarding passenger name records."
"I would therefore ask Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution in accordance with Rule 53(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, it is important for everyone to be made aware of the event that took place yesterday within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I could refrain from pointing it out and send a letter to Mr Poettering instead but, precisely because we are talking about discrimination, rights and equal opportunities, I am outraged as a woman, as an Italian woman …"
"– I must cut you off there, because this is not a personal statement at all."
"Perhaps you could raise it at the end of voting time."
"Mr President, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok — who has been one of our political group's negotiators for this joint motion for a resolution — has asked me to table an oral amendment which has in principle been negotiated with the representatives of the other political groups."
"This amendment would be inserted in paragraph 6, where it talks about ‘particular attention to the fight against organised crime’."
"It would be followed by ‘in the case of Bulgaria’, because the purpose of the amendment is to respond to the report produced by the Commission in May, and it would be unfair to extend this demand to Romania when, according to the Commission, progress has been satisfactory in that regard."
"That is the wording of the oral amendment, Mr President, and I hope that the House can accept it."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to invoke Rule 35 with reference to this vote."
"Under Rule 35(1), for all Commission proposals of a legislative nature, the committee responsible shall verify the legal basis."
"Rule 35(4) says that the committee should have disputed the validity of the proceedings regarding the period of reflection and the ratification process."
"This is for two reasons."
"First of all, under the EU’s own rules, any Member State rejecting the Constitutional Treaty has right of veto, and therefore it should be dead."
"My second point – and the most important point to me – is that the European Constitution is unconstitutional in terms of the British Constitution in relation to Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and various other acts of ..."
"– Mr Batten, I must cut you off there, because you are starting from a false premise: this is not a text of a legislative nature."
"Mr President, on a point of order, may I just point out that the interpretation was slightly behind you with regard to taking that vote."
"When you declared the vote open on the first vote, we were voting on the second part, because that was what the interpreter told us before you corrected yourself."
"You then closed the vote before we had an opportunity to correct our own votes."
"So, if possible, that vote should be dealt with again."
"Mr President, Mr Crowley has asked to retake the vote on the second section of Amendment 2."
"If you look at the numbers on your counting device, there is difference of 100 people who did not vote between part 1 and part 2."
"There was a total of approximately 630 votes for the first part, and only 545 for the second."
"Every now and again, because the electronic vote closes far too quickly, people do not get the chance, if they listen to the interpretation, to respond."
"I would ask you to allow a little more time for this."
"– The vote has taken place and we must now continue, but I certainly take note of what you have said."
"The fact remains that we will not restart the vote, because we never do that here."
"That concludes voting time."
"– Mr President, I well remember the grumbling from the Left at the application to extradite the lawyer Klaus Croissant, who was known to be not just the lawyer for German terrorists, but an active member of their network."
"Today, Big Brother is on the move, and it seems that nothing can stop him now in this European judicial area."
"The automatic transfer of sentenced persons from one European state to another is presented to us as being a big step forward."
"In a way, it seems that nationals of the EU are treated worse than nationals of third countries, whom we insist on keeping in the State where they were convicted, in the name of avoiding double jeopardy."
"You will allow me, in a Europe where thought crimes are on the increase, and where claims of national preference are equated with discrimination, legitimate discussions of aspects of history with revisionism, rejection of communitarism…"
"There is reason to commend Austria’s, Finland’s and Sweden’s initiative."
"It is in principle a good thing to help speed up the transfer of sentenced persons to a particular state with which they have connections in some way and in which optimum social rehabilitation is believed to be a real possibility."
"It is, however, worth pointing out that there is already a convention and an additional protocol from the Council of Europe on the transfer of sentenced persons."
"The June List also believes that legal and police cooperation should be intergovernmental."
"These issues must be decided on in the Council by unanimous decision and be subject to the scrutiny of the national parliaments, rather than being decided on by supranational institutions such as the European Parliament."
"The June List has therefore voted against the report as amended by Parliament – – a report that, amongst other things, contains wordings promoting European criminal law."
"We wish to emphasise that the June List is opposed to engaging in propaganda in favour of a liberal approach to drugs."
"We have thus voted against wordings along these lines."
"All use of drugs, other than for medical purposes, is harmful and is something that society should have no truck with."
"With regard to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, we believe on principle that there is no justification for the centre’s existence, since the Member States each have such different views on, and policies towards, the fight against drug misuse."
"We have thus voted against the report on strengthening the role of the centre."
". A regulation is being proposed to us that is designed to strengthen the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, to sort out its administrative and communication problems and to create new posts for officials."
"Just how effective, however, has this ultra-European tool been at a time when drugs are a scourge that continues to destroy families?"
"Drug addiction causes people to fail at school, makes them unable to work, causes them to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals and leads them to die by suicide or from overdoses."
"We need to see action taken, rather than having to read deteriorating statistics."
"Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is right to propose going beyond the mere collection of data in order also to assess the policies of the Member States so that the latter might benefit from best practice."
"This does not imply stripping Member States of their prerogatives and transferring these to the Monitoring Centre but, on the contrary, strengthening cooperation between the Member States."
"In addition to the death penalty for drug barons, we also need to see a radical change in mentality in order to silence the left-wing ideology of the last 40 years."
"This has led to lax attitudes towards criminality which have been accepted wholesale by smug governments and have led to the poisoning of millions of people, the physical consequences of which also lead to permanent social exclusion."
"Since it was set up in 1993, the main tasks of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction have been the collection, analysis and distribution of transnational data on drug problems."
"Thirteen years later, the results are not impressive."
"Although a certain improvement in our knowledge of the drug phenomenon in all its many aspects here in the European Union is to be observed, no positive effect on drug use is to be seen."
"Quite the contrary, in fact."
"One thing is to be noted."
"Today, it is no longer just the traditional drugs that are being taken."
"Instead, we are, to our consternation, witnessing the emergence of new markets for synthetic drugs and a situation in which drugs are produced more easily and more cheaply."
"They generate more profit for the traffickers and also do more harm to the health of those who take them."
"In reality, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is no more than a simple data base, devoid of any operational value."
"In fact, all the figures made available serve only to disguise the failure of the various national policies for combating drug misuse."
"It is high time that the Member States took their responsibilities seriously and stopped hiding behind bodies that are neither designed nor commissioned to act on their behalf."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was set up in 1993 and is based in Lisbon. Its role is to collect, analyse and disseminate objective, reliable and comparable data and in turn to provide an accurate overview of the phenomenon in Europe."
"If we are to establish an effective policy and measures to combat the problem, we need to be aware of its extent and nature."
"Although a great deal of progress has been made, there remains much to be done in terms of enhancing the monitoring instruments and developing a genuine ‘common language’."
"I voted in favour of this report on the Commission’s proposal on the EMCDDA."
"The main amendments will ensure that Parliament is involved in the codecision process, that the EMCDDA has a broader role and that the EMCDDA’s bodies adapt to post-enlargement Europe."
"The EMCDDA must obtain more objective and comparable data and must channel its efforts into a thorough evaluation of drug-related policy and of trends in drug use."
"I also wish to highlight the importance of improving the exchange of information on best practice in addressing drug issues and making that exchange more flexible."
"Mr President, even though the vote on Mrs Roure's report has been postponed, this has given me the opportunity to express my opinion on it."
"In my opinion, the European Union encourages people's fears regarding the transparency of their personal data, for example when it approves the transmission of personal data to the United States, a country with poor data protection security by European standards."
"We also need to ensure that personal data are adequately protected when it comes to the planned electronic identity documents for cross-border use, and, in my opinion, the proposed taxation of e-mails and text messages would be a monstrosity, because flat-rate contracts would require individual records to be kept and personal data collected for forwarding to the financial authorities."
"I do not feel that any of this has been given sufficient consideration in Mrs Roure's report."
"We voted in favour of the resolution as a whole but have some important objections."
"Firstly, the risk of pandemics should not be exaggerated."
"Should an epidemic occur, the EU should have a coordinating role."
"The main responsibility should, however, lie with the Member States."
"The resolution places too much of the responsibility on the EU."
"Certainly, there is a need to cooperate on making vaccines available in special situations ensuring, perhaps, that a vaccine is used where it is most needed."
"We question, however, whether the centralised EU vaccine stores proposed by the rapporteur are the most efficient response."
"Moreover, we see these as presenting many practical problems."
". As the rapporteur – a Cypriot doctor who is a Member of our political group – says, confusion in people’s minds about avian influenza and pandemic influenza is massive."
"Many people and authorities, he says, ‘seem to equate the arrival of A/H5N1 in Europe with the arrival of a pandemic virus’."
"He therefore suggests that improvements should be made to the Commission’s communication in generic preparedness planning for public health emergencies at EU level."
"He emphasises, as I did in a previous report, that the EU must lend technical, scientific and economic assistance to countries already affected and, in particular, contribute to raising global awareness and a global master plan coordinated at international, regional, sub-regional and national level with a proper road map and timetable."
"The rapporteur has sought to improve upon the Commission’s proposal and to clarify a number of points. We therefore voted in favour of this report."
"This report concerns an eminently cross-border issue."
"There are thus good reasons for the EU countries to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken."
"We have thus chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"We wish, however, to emphasise that isolated measures on the part of the EU are inadequate for meeting the challenges posed by a global influenza pandemic."
"It is therefore extremely important that the EU act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation, or WHO."
"We question individual points in the report, such as the need for the Commission to devise a comprehensive communication strategy together with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)."
"We presume that the EU countries are by themselves fully capable of communicating successfully with the people, without the aid of EU bodies."
"In the same way, we are opposed to the setting up of a common emergency supply of pandemic vaccines in the Community."
"We believe that internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO should concern themselves with global world health issues."
"We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting a significant political issue in order to extend the EU’s international political role."
". I should like to begin by pointing out that the confusion in people’s minds about avian influenza and pandemic influenza is massive."
"There is much to be done, therefore, in terms of communication."
"As political decision-makers, we must honour our duty to protect the citizens. We must ensure that the resources are in place to provide an effective response to any public health threat that our societies may face."
"It has been well documented that the threat of a flu pandemic is a public health issue that concerns all of us. That being said, the likelihood of it happening is open to question."
"Given that the relevant authorities believe that the risk to human health is actually small, it strikes me as crucial to establish a targeted prevention and rapid response mechanism for public health emergencies."
"This should include, as the report says, a targeted plan for coordinating action at all levels and accurate, accessible communication for all citizens so as to ensure that they are prepared for any eventuality."
"I accordingly voted in favour of the Amadou report."
"Mr President, in his book ‘The Constitution of Europe’, Joseph Weiler wrote extensively about how, in the past, the Court of Justice would systematically increase the field of competences of the European institutions without there being any democratic legitimacy for it and without the Court having been given a mandate by the Member States’ governments in this matter."
"Thanks to this notorious judgment of 13 September 2005, criminal law is now, in fact, also set to become a European competence."
"As a consequence, the Court of Justice is wiping the floor with the competence restrictions of the European treaties."
"The Court of Justice looks very much like a kind of judicial Absurdistan peopled by other-worldly judges who are no longer answerable to anything or anybody."
"People are then surprised when our citizens, when they get the opportunity, show their displeasure by, for example, voting out the European Constitution."
") One of the most important new elements in the Constitution is the proposal that all EU laws be able to have common penalties attached to them."
"It is perfectly logical for each Member State to determine, in the case of each law, what the price of breaking that law is to be."
"That is something that the Council of Ministers has also done."
"By means of an intergovernmental decision, it has unanimously determined the price to be paid for environmental crimes."
"The conflict is not about the content but about the form."
"The supranational European Court of Justice is not satisfied with being a court."
"The judges also want to be legislators, and in this case constitutional legislators into the bargain. What is more, they wish to legislate contrary to the unanimous decision of the Member States."
"They are simply adopting a section of the Constitution that has been expressly rejected."
"It is about as legal as the Beagle Boys deciding to empty Scrooge McDuck’s money bin."
"What are the judges thinking of?"
"They should be defending law and order but are themselves breaking the law."
"The Court of Justice could be put in its place by the parliaments of the Member States each deciding that this judgment is of no legal effect in their countries."
"We should also have a democratic procedure for appointing judges."
". This judgment acknowledges that the Commission, with Parliament’s support, was right to annul the framework decision on environmental protection via criminal law."
"It recognises that environmental protection requires concerted action to punish the most serious breaches."
"Accordingly, its objective and its substance fall under the competence of Community action programmes on the environment (EC Treaty) and not under the provisions of the EU Treaty on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters."
"In recognition of the fact that, broadly speaking, the Community does not have any powers on criminal matters, a useful precedent has been set whereby matters under the third pillar are communitarised and parliamentary control is strengthened in an area as sensitive as criminal law."
"The consequences are enormous, in terms of both adopting future legal instruments and the legal instruments already in force."
"These should be based on a new legal basis, the first pillar, which implies Parliament’s participation as co-legislator."
"A framework decision on the environment has been annulled but its consequences will be felt beyond this area, throughout Community policies and in fundamental freedoms when it becomes necessary to make use of criminal law measures to ensure their efficiency."
"The European Court of Justice’s judgment of 13 September 2005 constitutes a veritable legal revolution in what is usually called the Community legal system."
"Indeed, this is the first time that the Court of Justice has pronounced on issues of competence in penal matters and that it has decided that, for the purpose of protecting the environment, the European Union can demand that the Member States provide for criminal sanctions in the case of serious offences."
"In principle, penal legislation, just like the rules of criminal procedure, falls within the strict competence of the Member States."
"Through this legal decision, a portion of the penal law of the Member States has just been brought within the competence of the Community and has been so without the formal agreement of the nations."
"This also amounts to a harmonisation of penal law that the ‘no’ vote delivered by the French and the Dutch in their referendums on the Constitution had implicitly rejected."
"There is worse to come, however."
"There is a risk of such jurisprudence being extended to all Community spheres and, in particular, to that concerning would-be fundamental rights."
"I am thinking of spheres such as the fight against supposed racism and discrimination of various kinds, data protection, the right to asylum or, indeed, policies on migration."
"This development is not conducive to our freedoms, and it is most worrying."
"The report concerns the consequences of the European Court of Justice’s judgment C-176/03, which gave the EU powers to adopt, under the first pillar, necessary sanctions under criminal law in order to guarantee that full effect is given to the provisions of the first pillar, in this case in relation to the environment."
"The EC Treaty does not, however, contain any explicit allocation of authority in the matter of criminal law."
"In view of the considerable importance criminal law has for the sovereignty of the Member States, the implicit transfer of this authority to the Community should not be permitted."
"What is more, Articles 135 and 280 of the EC Treaty state explicitly that the Member States are responsible for the application of national criminal law and the administration of justice."
"In spite of this, the Commission has stated that there is no limit to the degree to which criminal law might be brought within the competence of the Community and that, in principle, all the areas regulated by the EC Treaty might be subject to such transfers of authority."
"Through the Court of Justice’s interpretation of the Treaties, the pillars are thus combined in a single institutional framework, which was a feature of the now rejected European Constitution."
"The June List is strongly opposed to this undermining of national self-determination and has thus voted against the report."
". Once again the European Court of Justice has determined that the Council has contravened the EC Treaty."
"The Council tried to sidestep the involvement of Parliament in the legislative process by using a different legal basis from the one laid down in the Treaty."
"It is therefore no surprise that it has been condemned by the judges in Luxembourg; indeed, it was easily foreseeable and is to be welcomed in every respect."
"It goes without saying that all the institutions are called upon to analyse the judgment and to use it to draw conclusions for the future."
"However, I do not understand what consequences the Commission is proposing."
"Although the ECJ proceeded very cautiously and reiterated the principle that the EC has no primary competence in criminal law and therefore that the EC Treaty only provides supplementary legislative competence in criminal law for very specific matters, the Commission seems to think that it can derive a general competence in criminal law for the EC from the Court's judgment."
"In the Council's wake, now the Commission, too, wants to take from the European Treaties competences that the Member States never gave it."
"The Commission's approach is not only unlawful in many respects; indeed, it is also unacceptable in terms of integration policy."
"Parliament has therefore quite rightly shown the red light to the Commission's proposals, in the form of Mr Gargani's report."
"The British Conservatives abstained on the Gargani report, since while we greatly appreciated the attempt by the rapporteur to strike the appropriate note of caution when trying to identify the proper application of the Court’s judgment, we do not agree it is even necessary to consider whether or not there is a need to activate the clause."
"We believe that more time is needed to consider what, if any, steps should be taken on the specific and immediate ramifications of this judgment before seeking to use it as a pretext for usurping national competence in criminal justice matters."
"– The report is in keeping with the ruling by the Court and the relevant Commission communication."
"Like the European Commission, the report interprets this ruling as granting the authority to introduce criminal provisions in all Community policies containing binding rules, in order to ensure that they are applied. This is a serious step towards the introduction of minimum criminal rules at EU level by the legislative institutions of the Union or, in other words, the 'communitisation' of criminal law."
"Paragraph 4 in particular basically proposes the adoption of common criminal law in the EU, thereby depriving the Member States of their exclusive sovereign right to determine for themselves what sort of behaviour they consider to be a criminal offence and of their right to determine the type and limits of criminal sanctions."
"In this way, one of the basic constituent elements of national grass-roots sovereignty is being seriously curtailed and one of the fundamental characteristics of the philosophy of the European Constitution, namely the precedence of Community law over national legislation and national constitutions, is being reintroduced through the back door, in order to directly impose on the people of Europe the will and strategic political ambitions of European monopolistic capital, which have now been raised to the status of law."
"That is why we voted against the report."
"I am voting in favour of Mr Bonde’s proposal for an alternative resolution, because he criticises the fact that the European Court of Justice is trying to use environmental law as a springboard to enable the EU to assume power over large parts of criminal law."
"I am not, however, categorically opposed to all types of rules under criminal law designed to combat cross-border environmental crimes."
"These may sometimes be needed in order, for example, to deal with vessels out at sea that are ruining the environment."
"Mr President, when Mrs Ždanoka’s report was being discussed, it was important for me that the amendments tabled for point 11 did not go through, as they had nothing to do with non-discrimination, and I therefore voted with the majority."
"Mr President, this month too, we can count ourselves lucky again with the umpteenth Utopian report against racism and discrimination, this time by Mrs Ždanoka."
"The document is, once again, a catalogue of politically correct commonplaces that are slowly but surely becoming this institution’s speciality."
"We are once again being inundated with the spectres of racism and discrimination, as well as calls for European legislation and for forcing the Member States to discriminate against the actual European citizens in favour of non-Europeans, who, according to this report, should not just receive the same political and social rights, but should, in many areas, also be given preferential treatment."
"There is, in this House, an apparent lack of common sense if we fail to realise that true racism in Europe is fortunately a very marginal phenomenon, but that, on the other hand, our citizens are anxious about the undermining and erosion of safety, welfare and the cultural identity to which they are entitled."
"Mr President, I voted against the Ždanoka report because we are yet again being faced with a list of proposals that do not offer a solution to the problem, but are, in fact, part of it."
"We must finally stop seeing minority groups, such as immigrants, as pitiful."
"We must stop attributing all their problems to discrimination from the outset."
"This left-wing discourse has only exacerbated the problems."
"What we need is a complete change of course."
"We must emphasise personal responsibility and the need for immigrants to adapt to our rules, our language, our standards and our values."
"The very fact that we in this House continuously talk about discrimination weakens the impulse for immigrants to integrate."
"This may benefit the growing anti-discrimination industry, but is detrimental to the immigrants as well as the countries where they have settled."
"The June List is opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether based on gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or conviction, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"We have therefore decided to support the report as a whole in order to demonstrate our support for all citizens of the EU Member States being able to enjoy the fundamental right of not being subjected to discrimination, even if we do not agree with all the wordings and have thus voted against these."
"I and my British Conservative colleagues are fundamentally committed to upholding equal opportunities for all."
"However, we have abstained on this report since in places it is over-detailed and prescriptive, and where it does propose specific measures it is far from clear that these would help Member States to develop a coherent and consistent anti-discrimination policy."
". The main proposals in this report bring into question three fundamental values of the European democracies."
"- ‘Positive action’, which is the European Parliament’s version of the ‘positive discrimination’ dear to Mr Sarkozy, breaks with the principle of equality between citizens of the same country."
"The measures proposed, such as ‘priority access’ to certain professions, constitute discrimination against our countries’ nationals, who do not have the opportunity to have immigrant status."
"- The ‘involvement of … non-citizens in elections’, that is to say foreigners’ right to vote, destroys the very principle of nationality."
"- The desire to give the same rights to homosexual as to heterosexual couples in all the Member States amounts to demanding the right for homosexuals to marry and to adopt children."
"If this demand were met, it would shatter the foundations of the family, which is the basic unit of any society."
"Alert it may be to the fate of immigrant populations and homosexual couples, but this report has not a word to say concerning scandalous forms of discrimination:"
"- discrimination suffered by tens of millions of honest people who are the victims of insecurity because they do not have the opportunity to live in protected parts of their towns;"
"- discrimination that, in France, deprives the millions who vote for France’s National Front of any representation in Parliament."
". I wish to congratulate Mrs Ždanoka on her important report on a framework strategy for non-discrimination and opportunities for all, to which I lend my full support."
"I particularly welcome the call for the Member States to take due account in their legislative practice of the various reasons for discrimination, with a view to bestowing a credibility on the Charter which has hitherto been weakened by the fact that the Charter is not legally binding."
"The fight against discrimination must be based on education, the promotion of best practice and campaigns targeting the general public and those areas and sectors where discrimination takes place."
"Awareness of the social impact of the phenomenon is probably the most effective way of combating discrimination."
"I welcome this report, which stipulates that the fight against discrimination must be based on education."
"The report encourages the promotion of best practices and campaigns targeting the general public and those areas and sectors where discrimination takes place."
"Given that discrimination largely stems from ignorance as regards other people, the report highlights the fact that the problem should therefore be tackled at source, by means of targeted actions designed to foster tolerance and diversity from early childhood; programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo and Jeunesse have a crucial role to play in this regard."
"The report explains that positive steps should be taken to overhaul recruitment policies and practices in order to remove those that impede disadvantaged groups from participating and playing an important role in society."
"I regret that the Commission is not planning at this stage to draw up comprehensive legislation to combat discrimination given that traditional national minorities urgently need a framework policy standard to create effective participation in decision-making processes concerning their identity, not only to overcome the double standards established by the Copenhagen criteria but also to combat a lack of any rules in the Member States."
"Legislation to combat all forms of discrimination is another example of would-be progressive legislation adopted by the EU in the social sphere."
"In response to a Green Paper from the Commission, Parliament is today adopting an own-initiative report offering its vision of the measures to be implemented to combat discrimination, both in society and in the workplace."
"As long ago as the year 2000, the EU was adopting two directives (2000/43 and 2000/78) forcing the Member States to provide themselves with legislative and judicial apparatus capable of curbing this phenomenon."
"Although all the national legislatures have thus been considerably strengthened, work remains to be done, particularly work based on education."
"Parliament is therefore putting forward a whole raft of initiatives designed to combat the various forms of direct and indirect discrimination, whether it be based on ethnic origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or religious conviction."
"The idea is to promote better practices to avoid ending up with ‘positive discrimination’ or the quota system advocated by some."
"The EU has few competences in the social sphere, but it has to be said that it takes the initiative when it has the means to do so."
"What we have here is an ambitious document that cocks an additional snook at those who strongly criticise Europe for not having a social dimension."
". I have supported Mrs Zdanoka’s report because the European Union needs a strong European strategy of non-discrimination."
"The fact is that, everywhere in Europe, we hear hateful words spoken and see despicable acts, including acts of violence, committed."
"The European Union needs a strategy to promote equal opportunities in order to put an end to all forms of discrimination."
"This European strategy may, in certain cases, involve the use of positive action."
"I believe, however, that, as is explicitly stated in Article 2 of the report, positive action differs from any kind of positive discrimination."
"Indeed, we would not be encouraging the fight against discrimination by creating a new form of discrimination."
"Positive action, in contrast, makes it possible to draw certain disadvantaged groups’ attention to specific measures of relevance to them, for example where recruitment policies are concerned."
"Finally, Parliament again points out in this document that discrimination against same-sex couples, whether married or registered, must be prohibited in the same way as any other form of discrimination and, in particular, when the people concerned assert their right to move freely within the territory of the European Union."
"In spite of there being points in which the rapporteur wishes to give the EU too much power and in which national legal practice is brought into question, it is the positive aspects of this report, relating to non-discrimination and equal opportunities for all, that predominate."
"The report as a whole is constructive, and I am therefore voting in favour of it."
"Mr President, although we take the view that Romania and Bulgaria undoubtedly belong to the European family of nations and need to have a European perspective, we do not expect that the two countries will be able to resolve their many problems with regard to corruption and organised crime within a few months."
"Particularly with regard to Bulgaria, you are very much mistaken if you cherish the hope that the country will be able to take more effective action against corruption and organised crime within its borders as a Member State of the EU."
"The problems in this area may even get worse, and increase the burden on the other Member States."
"The justified concerns and fears of the European public have not been taken seriously, and an enlargement avalanche has simply been set off with no reference to them, with a automatic path to enlargement."
"I cannot accept that, and I have therefore not approved this resolution."
"I abstained from voting on the joint motion for a resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania because I am unclear as to the point of adopting a position on the matter at this stage."
"I personally should have preferred it if, before expressing an opinion, the European Parliament had waited for the follow-up report to be presented by the Commission at the beginning of October of this year."
"If, by any chance, the Commission then appeared to express serious reservations about whether 1 January 2007 was the right time for one or other of these countries to join the EU, I really would not see the point of the motion for a resolution voted on today."
"Parliament’s going religiously through the motions is not, in my view, evidence of good democratic health."
"Let me be clear."
"For me, both Romania and Bulgaria and for that matter, Turkey, could meet the criteria for membership of the EU."
"What concerns me is that the former two still have some way to go, in my opinion, before they can join the Union."
"There are problems with corruption and the rule of law."
"It is important for both countries to continue to consolidate the ongoing reform of their justice systems, enhancing transparency, efficiency and the impartiality of their judiciary."
"With Bulgaria, we also have continued widespread discrimination against the Roma community in housing, healthcare, education and employment."
"They suffer from social exclusion."
"I realise that on the basis of Parliament's position, we can only delay membership from 2007 to 2008."
"At the moment, given the opportunity, I would have to vote to postpone Bulgaria's membership, and would have to consider my position carefully with respect to Romania."
". The successive rounds of enlargement have been an unparalleled success in the history of our continent."
"This is, broadly speaking, attributable to two factors."
"On the one hand, there is the consistent will, readiness and ability of the Member States to bring in new partnerships into the project at any given moment, with all the benefits and the extra burdens that any round of enlargement implies."
"On the other hand, this process has been successful due to the positive effects of the prospect of accession."
"The history of Europe of the past 50 years has largely been the history of a continent that has gradually adopted western democratic values on account of the expectations of accession."
"We must accordingly draw two conclusions regarding the prospects for Bulgaria and Romania's accession."
"Firstly, the EU’s desire to proceed with this enlargement should be absolute and the final timetable should be established at the next European Council."
"Secondly, it must be made clear that the accession will only take place when the conditions are properly in place."
"Our demands are justified and have yielded results."
"This has been borne out by the progress made by Romania during the past year."
"– The pressure on Bulgaria and Romania is mounting to ensure their people are fully subject to the dictats of the ΕU, so that more onerous terms can be imposed which will make it easier for the plutocracy to exploit the workers."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the ΕU is being pushed through along with the enlargement of ΝΑΤΟ, the demand for the involvement of military forces and the concession of the sovereign rights of these countries to the audacious imperialist plans of the USA, ΝΑΤΟ and the ΕU, at the expense of the people."
"The continual adaptation of accession conditions to the for the purposes of the Lisbon Strategy, the reform of the CAP, capitalist restructurings and the EU's more general anti-grassroots and anti-labour policy is resulting in extremely poor terms for the workers, with sweeping changes to fundamental employment and social rights."
"The people of these countries are realising day by day that they cannot expect anything positive to come out of their accession to the ΕU."
"The European Parliament motion for a resolution supports the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the imperialist union and their concession to the plans of the ΕU and a more intensive anti-grassroots policy against their people, which is why the European parliamentary group of the Greek Communist Party will vote against it."
"In his last speech a few moments ago, Mr Barroso, perhaps unwittingly, put his finger on the problem."
"He said that the European Union could not be enlarged and deepened against the will of the European citizens."
"That is true."
"It is just unfortunate that this conclusion was followed by nothing but a proactive pep talk, particularly as we are all familiar with the real sore points."
"Allow me to list them for you: the lack of democratic legitimacy for the European project, the big questions about spending European money wisely and, above all, those accession negotiations with Turkey which our citizens do not accept, and never will, and for which we will never find a democratic majority among our citizens."
"Europe cannot get back on track before something is done about that."
"Another wearisome debate dominated by the slow-learning fanatics of a failed and rejected Constitution."
"They think that by repeatedly swearing allegiance to that which voters, when permitted, have repudiated, they will somehow resuscitate it."
"In voting against the resolution I again stand on the side of the citizen who wants less not more Europe, states rights not Brussels control, and local not central power."
"The degree of energy wasted by the political leaders of Europe in trying to foist an unwanted Constitution on our people is quite staggering."
"Rejection may not be palatable, but it must be faced."
"."
"Mr President, I voted against this motion for a resolution because the German police took unprecedented action today against citizens of the Czech Republic."
"The police refused entry into Germany for dozens of football fans who wanted to attend the 2006 football World Cup."
"In my view, this runs counter to both the free movement of persons in the EU and the Treaty of Maastricht."
"I believe that a number of my fellow Members will join me in asking the German Government to explain how it is possible that it can trample underfoot the basic principles of the EU's existence."
"I have already submitted questions to the Commission and the Council in this connection."
"Essentially, I very much want to say that I emphatically refuse to see the draft Constitutional Treaty buried today."
"Let us reject outright this pervasive and unhealthy preoccupation with failure."
"Let us give ourselves the chance to make progress."
"Let us continue with the process of ratification so as to attain the four-fifths threshold laid down in Declaration 30."
"If we do so, the European Council will, as we know, have to tackle the issue."
"It will then have rather more issues to puzzle over than it does at present, and in particular:"
"- that of whether and, if so, under what conditions, ratification might again be sought in those countries that rejected the Constitutional Treaty in referendums;"
"- and that of how to safeguard at least those parts of the document that make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, those that enable the enlarged Europe to operate more efficiently and, moreover, those that accentuate the EU’s social role."
"Do not tell me that a majority of people are opposed to those aspects of the document."
"I do not believe that they are."
"Admittedly, this would not please those who are past masters in the art of doubt and demoralisation."
"I personally, however, wish to set in motion again the virtuous circle constituted by the process of European integration."
". We voted against this motion for a resolution, because it emphasises support for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"The idea of pursuing the global commitment to the Treaty, which is at variance with the opinion expressed by the people of France and the Netherlands in the referendums of last year, is unacceptable."
"How can we go on speaking about the need to deepen democracy when decisions freely taken by people in democratic referendums are not respected?"
"This kind of hypocrisy demonstrates the deep chasm between the people and the elites of the Community institutions."
"We also object to the propaganda campaign in the form of a series of parliamentary fora to meet the deadlines, in which they call for a ‘constitutional solution’, as the motion for a resolution confirms, when the 2009 elections to Parliament are called."
"Greater attention should have been paid to social problems and to finding an across-the-board solution for the aspirations of the people, with a view to improving well-being, development and economic and social cohesion."
"We have today voted in favour of Mr Leinen’s draft motion for a resolution on the next step during the period of reflection and analysis in relation to the future of Europe."
"As we have previously pointed out, we do not, however, believe that the Charter on Fundamental Rights should be legally binding."
". I abstained in the final vote on the motion for a resolution on the future of Europe."
"I consider this motion for a resolution to be superfluous and even counterproductive."
"As a defender of the Constitutional Treaty, I expect all 25 Heads of State or Government to honour their signatures and submit the draft for ratification by their respective countries."
"The people of France and the Netherlands voted ‘no’."
"Before asking these Member States possibly to reconsider their votes, it is necessary that, after Finland, the other dilatory Member States express their opinions, beginning with the United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Portugal, Ireland and Denmark."
"Europe’s future depends on the choices also of those countries."
"The European Union cannot do without this debate."
"How many times will it be necessary to repeat in this House that the European Constitution has twice expired: once on 29 May 2005 in France, and again on 2 June in the Netherlands?"
"The French and Dutch ‘no’ votes were clear and were delivered with full knowledge of the facts."
"Because referendums were organised, people had a proper grasp of the document."
"What they were rejecting were both the form (the superstate) and the content (the ultraliberal policies proposed), not to mention enlargement to include Turkey."
"Have you heard?"
"Have you been listening?"
"Have you understood?"
"You have not even taken the trouble to do so, and the document put to the vote today is proof of the fact."
"You are encouraging those Member States that have not already done so to ratify, preferably through parliamentary means, a document that no longer has reason to exist and to do so in order that the debate might really only take place between the initiated and in order that the two ‘renegade’ states might be constrained into voting again on a Constitution."
"Plan D, whose implementation you call for, is in reality a plan for disinformation and is a denial of democracy."
"The true democracy we seek in this case is not participatory or even representative."
"It is referendum democracy, and that is what frightens you: giving back to the nations the voice that you took from them."
"With the referendums in France and the Netherlands, the draft Constitution was rejected."
"Of that there can be no doubt."
"Two countries said ‘no’ in referendums and did so by large majorities and with high turn-outs."
"The fact that the EU’s power-wielding elite is now trying to explain away this state of affairs is a democratic scandal."
"Politicians and senior officials are now openly discussing how to get around the results of these referendums."
"They have the cheek to come up with their own interpretation of the results in terms of dissatisfaction with existing governments in the two countries."
"They are beginning to count how many countries have said ‘yes’, in spite of its being clear that all the countries must approve the draft."
"Seldom has the gulf between the political elite and the people on EU issues been seen so clearly."
"Everything indicates that there would have been a ‘no’ vote in Germany too if there had been a referendum there."
"The same applies in, for example, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark and perhaps a number of other countries."
"Democratic outcomes are merely setbacks for those who have lost the vote because they lack grass-roots support."
"Let us now instead devise a new treaty that emphasises the EU’s intergovernmental cooperation."
"– The period of reflection has been used to convince the people to accept the so-called 'European Constitution' rejected by France and the Netherlands by 54.7% and 61.6% respectively and millions of euros from the budget, in other words of taxpayers' money, have been spent in the process."
"Propaganda has been spread to the effect that the peoples of France and the Netherlands made a mistake and that the values of the capitalist EU come first, in other words the values of the free market and the interests of capital."
"Voters, however, decided on the basis of their life experience and stood up against the anti-grassroots, reactionary policy of the ΕU and its governments, a policy which favours the plutocracy."
"EU policy is being disputed and that is a good thing."
"That is why other governments have been too scared to hold referenda and have sought approval of the European Constitution via the parliamentary route."
"The attempt to reintroduce the European Constitution under another name shows disdain for the grassroots verdict and mocks the people."
"The European Constitution is dead and to attempt to resuscitate it is to ride roughshod even over those principles of unanimity of the bourgeois pseudo-democracy of the ΕU."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party will make use of this extended period of reflection to continue to inform and to reveal the inhumanity and barbarity of Euro-unifying policy and, at the same time, will call on the people to fight to overturn it."
". Progress has been made in constructing a more coherent and united Europe, but there are still barriers to achieving many of the objectives we have set ourselves."
"Aside from meetings aimed at examining the status quo, there has been no reflection on the Constitutional Treaty involving the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, aiming at considering the reasons and the criticisms of those who, in the wake of the ratification by some Member States, the rejection by others and the silence of other countries, highlighted the inadequacy of some parts of the text and the muddled nature of the text as a whole."
"Europeans have growing doubts about the legally binding aspect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lacks important references such as protection of the family."
"The issue of our roots also remains unresolved."
"We do not want a situation whereby, in not wanting to know where we come from, Europe is not certain about which direction to go in."
"Uncertainty gives rise to increased external and internal threats to the Union, as a result of international terrorism and uncontrolled illegal immigration."
"The crisis in a society that is losing its reference points and values is causing many young people to adopt apathetic or violent attitudes."
"The failure to facilitate development on account of the inability to manage the processes of globalisation and to give the necessary boost to a dynamic development model that addresses the problems existing at European and international level …"
". Firstly, the debate on the future of Europe does not simply boil down to the constitutional debate, and nor does the debate on the constitutional treaty cover the entire debate on the future of Europe."
"I do not believe that this is more glamorous and attractive to the citizens. It is necessary, although I doubt how urgent it is."
"It should certainly take place in full view of the citizens."
"In my opinion, however, what is really needed is to update and consolidate the structural decision-making model of the EU within a framework that is democratic and that respects national identity and diversity, given that the EU in its current configuration finds it difficult to cope with the realities of life with 25 Member States, let alone 27, 28 or 29."
"I feel therefore that the solution lies in a fresh debate when the societies that are most hostile to this proposal show that they are ready. This may also take the form of restricting the ‘constitutional’ impulse to a more modest and realistic institutional reform that is vital to the EU’s new life."
"Most importantly, though, there needs to be a response to what actually concerns the citizens, especially economically speaking."
"There is a lack of policy, a lack of results and a lack of growth and jobs in an economy that is irrevocably in the throes of change."
"The truth is that these challenges are, for our citizens, a matter of priority in relation to the Constitution."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) recognises that the proposed Constitutional Treaty addresses many important issues which need to be dealt with in order for an EU of 25 or more member states to work effectively and democratically."
"We have abstained on this resolution, however, because we believe it attempts to prejudge the outcomes of the period of reflection and because it could be seen as showing insufficient sensitivity to the democratic outcomes of the French and Dutch referenda."
"We believe it more important for the EU to be delivering tangible benefits to its citizens before returning to the structural reforms for better decision-making."
"Mr President, on a point of order and to clarify what I said earlier on, during the vote on the period of reflection, in the split vote relating to paragraph 2 of Amendment 2, you requested a roll-call vote but then changed your mind and said the first part of that split vote would be checked."
"Unfortunately, the interpretation did not come through in time, so the vote that I cast for the first part should have been for part two."
"I was against part two, but was in favour of part one."
"I and many of my colleagues were caught in this dilemma."
"Could the record show – I know you cannot go back and retake the vote – that those Members who voted did so in error."
"Certainly, votes can be corrected."
"Having said that, I have received a number of reports from fellow Members to the effect that matters proceeded perfectly clearly, and I think it is sometimes rather too easy to blame the interpretation."
"Therefore, you may, of course, change your vote; but, that being said, I consider matters to have proceeded perfectly normally."
"The next item is the debate on the following:"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0041/2006 B6-0209/2006) by Anders Wijkman, John Bowis and Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0042/2006 B6-0210/2006) by Anders Wijkman, John Bowis and Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0043/2006 B6-0211/2006) by Chris Davies, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0044/2006 B6-0212/2006) by Chris Davies, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0045/2006 B6-0213/2006) by Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0046/2006 B6-0214/2006) by Satu Hassi, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0047/2006 B6-0215/2006) by Adamos Adamou and Jonas Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0048/2006 B6-0216/2006) by Adamos Adamou and Jonas Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0050/2006 B6-0217/2006) by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0051/2006 B6-0218/2006) by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"

"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0053/2006 B6-0220/2006) by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy;"
"- the oral question to the Council (O-0056/2006 B6-0222/2006) by Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy and"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0057/2006 B6-0223/2006) by Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Sustainable Development Strategy."
"Mr President, what we are debating today, then, is the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy, an extremely important document from the European Council’s meeting in Gothenburg five years ago."
"We should have liked to have seen a more comprehensive review and, above all, a report by the Commission noting what has really been achieved during the last few years."
"We should also have liked to have seen more ambitious long-term goals specifically set out."
"The truth is, of course, that, in many areas, we have not made any clear progress in comparison with how matters stood in 2001. Biodiversity continues to be impoverished and climate-affecting emissions are still increasing in the majority of Member States."
"We have social divisions, migratory pressure at our borders and an array of problems in the field of health, for example resistance to antibiotics. These are all things that we must, of course, get to grips with in a way that takes account of the long term."
"I wish to thank the Austrian Presidency for having involved MEPs in a meaningful way."
"Horizontal in nature, this is a difficult issue to deal with, and it has to be asked whether we are sufficiently well organised, both in government offices and in the Commission and the European Parliament."
"We are organised on a vertical and sectoral basis, but this is a horizontal problem."
"We should reflect on this in the long term."
"One of the main issues in this connection is the relationship between the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy."
"Certain MEPs wish to combine these strategies in the long run."
"What is important right now, of course, is to bring about the best possible coordination and for we MEPs to be involved in the process."
"We think that the Sustainable Development Strategy should not, in the first place, be seen as an obstacle to, or problem for, growth and development but, rather, as an opportunity."
"The world is crying out for intelligent solutions to, for example, our energy and transport problems."
"This should be made a main issue in the Lisbon process."
"A big advantage of the Commission’s new proposals is that the international dimension is now included. We see the EU leaving an ever bigger ecological footprint on the world, a state of affairs that we must, of course, do something about."
"It also requires that progress in society be measured in a different way in the future."
"We cannot only look at GDP growth, but must also consider a range of other factors."
"Another logical consequence of the international perspective is, of course, that we must let the sustainability dimension influence our development aid very much more than we have allowed it to do so far."
"Finally, I wish to emphasise the importance of research issues."
"I have a number of questions for both the Commission and the Council."
"How do you wish to strengthen coordination between the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy and, above all, how do you wish to ensure that there is more encouragement for the environmental technology industry and for innovations in this area?"
"How does the Commission wish to ensure that the sustainability aspects are better reflected in the budget than they are at present, especially in the aid budget?"
"Finally, we must get to grips with the problem of the EU’s increased ecological footprint."
"Are you considering integrated measures of some kind to tackle this issue?"
"This Parliament’s procedures leave us in a position of weakness."
"We are, after all, trying to influence the document that will go to the European Council this week, but in practice I assume that has already been written, finalised, translated into 20 different languages and our impact in this Chamber is likely to be somewhat limited."
"Perhaps that is something to consider in future."
"However, I wish to congratulate the Austrian Presidency, because it has at least made this a priority; it has tried to pull together the threads and it has looked at ways to take this agenda forward, which is welcome."
"To me the big issue, though, is implementation."
"Take one example: national sustainable development strategies have to be prepared in all cases by next June."
"But what if they are not?"
"What tools, what mechanisms, do we have to ensure that Member States actually deliver on the pledges the prime ministers will agree this Friday?"
"We need more indicators."
"There is a good suggested list here in Austria’s draft paper, but it is simply not comprehensive enough."
"We need specific performance tables; we need the opportunity to name and shame, to point the finger at those Member States that pay lip service to the idea of sustainable development, but do not match their fine words with deeds."
"What we really need is for the Commission, as the independent arbiter, to be able to find mechanisms to put pressure on Member States which are so reluctant to rock the boat within the Council and to point the finger at one another."
"Five years ago, when the Natura 2000 programme was being prepared, Commissioner Wallström, the then Environment Commissioner, used the fact that structural funds could be withheld unless the Habitats Directive was properly complied with as a means of encouraging the process."
"That threat of withholding money from Member States brought about a dramatic transformation in performance and the submission of new ideas."
"I hope that over the next few months and years the Commission will come up with mechanisms of that kind to really put pressure on Member States where it hurts."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to understand that sustainable development is the basis of our future."
"If we forget that, the basis of our economy will also disappear."
"It is a misconception that economic development and environmental protection would be in conflict with one another."
"Our experience is quite the opposite."
"Ambitious environmental protection promotes economic development, and this applies to both countries and sectors of industry."
"Industry has called for the economic effects of environmental policy to be analysed."
"The problem is that when an analysis is carried out, the results are not believed."
"When, for example, analyses showed that the REACH chemicals legislation is economically viable, industry did not believe it."
"Similarly, when analyses show that cleaning up air pollution pays off, the car industry lobbies against it."
"We need ambitious targets, when, for example, it comes to saving energy."
"The least we could do, and the cheapest option, is that we should decide to end aid that is harmful to the environment."
"Aid for fossil energy in the EU amounts to more than EUR 24 billion a year, which is four times more than that for renewable energy."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I wish to express our disappointment and displeasure about the lack of progress in developing and monitoring the sustainable development strategy."
"We agree that the sustainable development strategy must include three core, interconnected objectives which have not only environmental, but also social and economic repercussions."
"And yet the Council and the Commission appear once again to be more concerned, as far as sustainable development is concerned, with promoting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, despite its environmental and social repercussions."
"Unfortunately, the Lisbon Strategy relates mainly but not solely to economic competitiveness and the creation of prosperous jobs, with environmental objectives coming a very poor second, while the sustainable development strategy needs to promote environmental and social objectives, rather than economic sustainability."
"I should like to point out, given that a large percentage of the European population suffers from serious economic and social problems, such as poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, and the fact that the most deprived social groups often suffer the worst social and environmental conditions, including poor housing and health, that the framework for Commission action to review the sustainable development strategy is extremely reticent and weak."
"The objectives being formulated by the Commission are extremely general in nature and therefore difficult to assess."
"For example, the Commission has introduced the European year for fighting poverty and social exclusion, an initiative that we welcome, but has failed to formulate more specific initiatives and effective, enforceable measures which will allow real progress to be made."
"."
"Mr President, the strategy which the Commission has published sends out a positive message: it demonstrates that the Commission too has time for a sustainable society."
"I can concur with the conclusion which the Commission has drawn in its document, namely that, if we want to work towards a sustainable society, we must seize the existing opportunities now."
"That should also be the message to the Council."
"If we want to make sustainable development a success, then there are many examples of measures we could take straight away."
"I would like to remind you that we do not own this planet, but that we have the task of looking after it and saving it."
"As a consequence, we will really have to change our way of living if we want to secure an existence for our children and grandchildren."
"That is why we need an ambitious package of measures, and I would like to hear from the Council and Commission how they would like to work on it together with this Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am grateful to the Austrian Presidency for having made this strategy one of its key priorities."
"I hope that, although our document comes slightly late in the day, the Summit will decide on something practical in this regard over the next few days and not confine itself to making token or rhetorical statements."
"I should like to extract and highlight three key words that I consider essential from the contribution made by Parliament in the shape of the unanimous resolution on which we shall vote tomorrow."
"The first word is integration."
"The Lisbon and Gothenburg European Councils were held one year apart."
"Five years later, the time has perhaps come to integrate them more, maybe even with a buzz word, with a new word such as , in such a way as to overcome this contradiction and this distinction between competitiveness and environment."
"The second word is governance."
"We genuinely need to give a strong boost to the Member States and, I stress, to what is actually taking place at a local and regional level, so that everyone, across the board, might play a leading role in implementing this strategy in practice."
"Actions cannot only come from above, but this leading role also needs to be promoted."
"Finally, the third word is monitoring."
"I very much agree with the need to define a concise set of, let us say, multicriterial indicators, which measure the progress made towards sustainability on a regular and ongoing basis."
"This is vital if we are to win over the citizens, who must have the opportunity to ascertain in practice the progress made or the difficulties encountered in pursuing our objectives."
"I believe that this bottom-up form of monitoring is very important."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic theory based on sustainable development abandons the approach grounded only in an analysis of GDP and employment in favour of an interpretation of a country’s cyclical position."
"Work is natural capital, the capital produced by people."
"The European sustainable development strategy and the Lisbon Agenda must integrate the economic dimension with the social and environmental dimensions in order to guarantee long-term development."
"For this strategy to be successful, it is essential to act at all levels of governance, from the largest international and national organisations to the local Agenda 21, which in Italy too is at last becoming one of the most important forces driving the spread of a sustainable management model."
"Acting at a local level is the key principle that makes it possible to pursue major objectives like preserving what natural capital is left, reducing human pressure on the world around us, and improving the efficiency of the end uses of products, for instance by promoting energy-efficient buildings and environmentally friendly urban transport systems."
"The extension of Commission support to the system of so-called ‘green’ public works contracts is producing good results."
"Nevertheless, in common with Members in other groups – and I am glad to have heard the speaker before me – I must highlight a number of aspects that I consider very important."
"The Commission ought to be more specific and to stick to definite and therefore verifiable objectives."
"That is the only way that all the actors in the sustainable economy will be encouraged to adopt an ecologically and socially compatible model."
"There is still a great deal to do in Europe to ensure that our energy supplies are based on renewable sources, in order to protect the environment from pollution and from the excessive, irreversible exploitation of natural resources."
"In this context I consider it essential for sustainable development indicators to be developed and improved: they need to be easily understood and accessible to the general public."
"It is important to try to monitor all the outcomes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European sustainability strategy is an important topic and a top priority for the Austrian Presidency of the Council."
"In the past few months, 10 different Council configurations have dealt with the subject of assessing and implementing the sustainability strategy for Europe, in order to strengthen the quality of the strategy across the board, including with our own working group, 'Friends of the Presidency'."
"We want the European Union to act as an international frontrunner, and to demonstrate its capabilities as, so to speak, a 'sustainable union' at international level."
"That applies to the European Union with its central institutions, to the territorial authorities, to the regions and to the municipalities."
"We want to send out clear signals promoting sustainable development."
"It would be inappropriate to concentrate solely on economic growth, economic development and the Lisbon Strategy: it is not compatible with Europe's history, and I also do not think it is enough to act sustainably in the future."
"We have the impression that, following the discussions, in general a text could be negotiated that is both balanced and politically significant."
"In line with the instructions of the European Council of December 2005, we now have a single, coherent document that brings together aims, tasks, indicators and a whole range of specific actions for essential EU policy areas."
"This renewed EU sustainability strategy should be clearly visible from the outside."
"The document that the European Council will adopt in the next few days has no annexes, and is clearly structured, comprehensible and consistent."
"This constructive cooperation, in particular from the Member States, and the intensive dialogues between the various parties involved have led us to the success that we hope will be achieved in the days to come."
"We have had a whole range of contacts and positive conversations with representatives of the European Parliament."
"We in the Presidency have tried very hard and quite consciously to include the central points brought up by the European Parliament in the negotiations – and, as far as possible, in the compromise as well."
"You have frequently talked about how we need to view the issue of the link between the Lisbon Strategy and the EU sustainability strategy from the aspect of qualitative growth."
"We want to send a clear political signal that sustainable development will not, as some intend, put the brakes on economic growth, but will actually support and enable intelligent growth in areas for the future."
"That is what we need to do with this strategy."
"The strategy repeatedly refers to issues such as renewable energy sources, environmental technology, 'greening' public procurement, resources and energy efficiency, the environment as a factor for more jobs, intelligent and innovative products and services and mobility solutions."
"Growth cannot be an end in itself, but just a means to an end, and that end is improving the quality of life and of the environment in Europe, whilst maintaining long-term competitiveness."
"If the people and the environment are doing well, then the economy will also do well."
"Europe has always particularly distinguished itself in the past, and will continue to do so in future, by the way in which it runs its economy according to different criteria from other national economies in the world."
"Regarding the relationship to the Lisbon Strategy, the two strategies, each with its own priorities and timescales, should continue to exist separately from one another, but support and strengthen each other."
"The central goal is greater transparency and a higher status for the EU sustainability strategy at political level."
"The two strategies should therefore be further developed and implemented in close coordination in content terms."
"We want to make it clear that the EU strategy for sustainable development and the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs do not exclude each other, compete with each other or supersede each other, but rather complement each other effectively."
"The EU strategy for sustainable development provides a comprehensive framework within which the Lisbon Strategy, with its new focus on growth and jobs, can act as the engine of a dynamic economy."
"In our opinion, both strategies underline the fact that economic, social and environmental goals can strengthen each other and should therefore be designed, developed and promoted together."
"Both strategies aim to support the necessary structural changes that will allow the economies of the Member States to face up to the challenges of globalisation, which affect all of us in Europe."
"The aims and main content of the sustainability strategy, including in comparison to Gothenburg 2001, which will become the key challenges for sustainable development, are clearly laid out in the paper and in the strategy, and are also translated into concrete terms through targets and actions: climate change and environmentally-friendly energy, sustainable mobility and transport planning, sustainable production and consumption models, which will be an important guide for the future, management of natural resources, health, social integration, demographics and migration, which is probably one of the greatest challenges facing the continent and a major challenge in relation to the fight against poverty and for sustainable international development."
"The new key challenge of sustainable consumption and production models caused a great deal of controversy, but has now been incorporated into the strategy."
"One major success that has been mentioned by several speakers here is certainly the creation of a separate chapter in the strategy setting out implementation mechanisms for effective follow-up and for evaluating and assessing the progress made."
"As you can see, we have put a great deal of energy into this sustainability strategy."
"We have kept 10 Council configurations busy, and we have tried to resolve this apparent competition between Lisbon and sustainability, so I am very pleased that, taking your comments into consideration and following intensive negotiations with the Member States, we will be in a position to adopt this EU sustainability strategy within the next few days."
"That is good for the quality of life in Europe, and it is a positive sign for the future."
"Mr President, the Sustainable Development and Lisbon strategies together address issues that really concern people."
"European value and quality of life surveys tell us that citizens want prosperity, but they also want a clean environment, good health, social protection and equality."
"The Commission put forward its proposal for the review of the European Union’s Sustainable Development Strategy in December."
"This has been the subject of in-depth debate in the Council, culminating in the adoption of a review of the Strategy at the European Council scheduled for tomorrow."
"I welcome Parliament’s input from January on the stocktaking and orientations for the review, and I appreciate the involvement of many of you in the stakeholder debate on this subject."
"I look forward to working with you further on this, on the issues raised in the motion for a resolution amongst others."
"Sustainable development is an over-arching objective of the Union."
"The European Union Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy work hand in hand towards this objective, although they should be kept separate."
"Together the strategies are an agenda for change, for Europe to adapt to a changing global context: new competitors, an aging population, and the impacts of demographic change, increased resource scarcities, climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem loss, for example."
"They aim to stimulate innovation, including behavioural change, create level playing fields and engage all."
"The Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy are complementary."
"The much-needed economic growth must be decoupled from environmental degradation and must better safeguard social cohesion to ensure it can be sustained."
"At the same time, though, the worldwide drive towards more eco-efficient products and services creates opportunities for growth and jobs that we must seize."
"For both we need to act."
"By achieving results on sustainable development, we improve our chances of regaining citizens’ confidence in the European Union."
"To achieve results, we need to focus and be clear about who does what."
"This implies a certain practical distribution of work between the two strategies."
"The Lisbon Strategy addresses concerns about medium-term economic performance, looking to stimulate growth and jobs and helping the European Union to adapt to global competition and increased pressures on resources."
"To achieve this aim, the Lisbon Strategy comprises actions in a wide range of policy areas, many of which are central to sustainable development strategy, such as energy efficiency, environmental technologies resource use, and others."
"The SDS addresses concerns about our prosperity, both in economic and quality of life terms, including issues that are more slow-burning, where time-lags mean that actions now have impacts into the long term."
"A good example is climate change, but also unsustainable modes of transport, social exclusion, health and how we use our natural resources."
"It also looks at broader global challenges and impacts beyond the European Union’s borders."
"But let us be clear: Lisbon and the SDS are mutually reinforcing."
"The success of one depends on the success of the other."
"The priority now is to achieve results."
"There have been more than 20 years of debate on sustainable development, but progress in addressing unsustainable trends is too slow."
"We must move from words to action."
"Some say that we are not ambitious enough."
"I disagree."
"The Commission’s revised SDS provides a new political drive for sustainable policies that apply to all policy areas."
"We also welcome the priority given by the Austrian Presidency to the revisions of SDS and the draft conclusions that will be discussed at this week’s European Council."
"We are talking about a new drive aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are necessary for sustainable development."
"The review of the European Union’s Sustainable Development Strategy is about how we can do things better to get results: first, about how we design policy, including policies within the Lisbon Agenda; second, about implementing what has been agreed; third, about making sure that we involve all those who need to act."
"The European Union institutions cannot achieve sustainable development alone."
"The new strategy addresses some of the weaknesses of the previous strategy: unclear priorities, little ownership and absence of a clear monitoring mechanism."
"It confirms the main challenges, but clarifies the objectives and sets out a new and more rigorous monitoring mechanism."
"It includes regular reports from the Commission, which are to be submitted every two years, drawing on the latest Eurostat indicators."
"It includes national strategies, to be updated to bring them more into line with the European Union Strategy, and it includes peer review of national strategies to allow mutual learning."
"We need to learn from best practice and use every opportunity to multiply successful initiatives."
"By clarifying priorities, we will also facilitate the coordination of the Lisbon and Sustainable Development strategies."
"The renewed Sustainable Development Strategy re-emphasises the importance of an integrated approach."
"The problems are interlinked and so are the solutions."
"Good use of impact assessments that address the economic, social and environmental impacts of proposals is key."
"Horizontal measures, such as getting prices right, investment and research and innovation, education and skills are also important."
"The new strategy is about all of us assuming our responsibilities."
"Involving stakeholders, businesses and citizens in delivering results is a priority."
"It is also about all European Union institutions and Member States working for the implementation of the Strategy."
"We believe that the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should play a more active role in helping to implement and monitor the strategy."
"."
"Mr President, I feel less optimistic than those who have spoken so far, because I believe that the document that has been produced is essentially a document full of statements, which includes many existing clichés, many arguments that we have all heard and which are leading to an increasingly weak and less respected notion of sustainable development."
"Why do I say this?"
"Because I believe that the structure in the methodology – and, as well as a politician, I am speaking as an academic – is based on an error: it is based on repeating the old clichés and on not properly analysing today’s sustainable development problems."
"Firstly, it does not make it clear whether the document has European or world ambitions."
"It does not make that clear."
"Secondly, it conforms to Gothenburg, but not to Johannesburg."
"Furthermore, it ignores problems such as the relationship between the economy and sustainable development."
"Today, economic activities cannot be separated from sustainability, and if we want to link it to Lisbon, even less so: in other words, there can be no employment, there can be no possibility of development for the under-developed countries, unless we take into account what kind of economy is appropriate."
"Certain economic activities are necessary in order to maintain biodiversity."
"Have we considered what economic activities are required or the role agriculture plays in maintaining animals?"
"Have we taken account of the fact that, if we want to talk about climate change and development in Africa, we must talk about nuclear energy in order to resolve the problem of obtaining water through desalination and obtaining energy that does not pollute?"
"If we talk about climate change, we must talk about nuclear energy as well, as a replacement for 30 or 40% of what is produced."
"In other words, structurally, the document is not integrated."
"It does not refer to the economy and it completely ignores industry."
"Furthermore, I do not believe that the issue of population is sufficiently dealt with."
"The emigrations we have from North to South in Europe are creating stress in terms of sustainable development, just like the African emigrations."
"That is something we must deal with, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of sustainable development."
"."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Social Democrats I can say that I agree with the Commissioner that we must at long last move from words to deeds in the matter of policy on sustainable development."
"There needs to be a proper action programme for sustainable development as part of EU policy."
"Sustainable development must be genuine and be capable of measuring the principle of penetrability, which relates to all the European Union’s political goals."
"Policy instruments, for their part, need to adapt to these goals."
"So it is unacceptable that projects that harm the environment should at present be supported with massive amounts of money, considering how aid is channelled for projects that improve the environment."
"The decisions already taken should also be implemented."
"The Council decided years ago now that aid that harms the environment should be gradually withdrawn."
"That has not happened, neither gradually nor in any other way."
"EU-wide environmental taxes have also been talked about in several contexts."
"We know that their introduction will require consensus, but we need a step forward in the right direction."
"The Council has also taken decisions that Europe-wide energy taxes should be introduced."
"The Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which the Council and Parliament adopted in the codecision procedure, will provide an opportunity for the introduction of Europe-wide environmental taxes."
"A condition of a genuine environmental policy is that the economic policy instruments in legislation and other legislative acts go hand in hand."
"In this way a favourable situation can be achieved, in which society develops eco-efficiency and environmentally friendlier technologies in an economically rational way."
"In this respect, we are coming to a crossroads as far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned, which is to say that the environment is also a good thing for the economy, and its development is a means of getting the wheels of the economy turning."
"Mr President, the renewal of the Sustainable Development Strategy is very welcome, but it must become more focused."
"The need to have better coordination with other cross-cutting strategies like Lisbon is well established, but we also need to have better coordination within the sustainable development strategy itself."
"We need to think clearly and recognise that some of our sustainable development policies could potentially conflict with others."
"For example, we are committed to a European target for biofuels and I very much support this, but the sustainable development strategy also includes a commitment to sustainable forest management and to halting the loss of biodiversity."
"A badly thought-through expansion of biofuels could result in virgin forests being destroyed and habitats lost."
"A properly thought-through biofuels policy would mean European vehicles running on biofuels from certified sources only."
"So I would beg the Presidency in this regard simply to use the strategy as a starting point for much more detailed work on sustainability."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we have only borrowed the earth from our descendants."
"We all know that any form of politics that lacks responsibility towards this principle imposes a hurdle on the next generation that cannot be overcome."
"Jacques Delors declared as early as 1993 that in order to meet future challenges the European Union has the urgent task of restructuring the economy in a way that is ecologically and socially fair, and of orienting it towards a sustainable strategy; Mr Pröll has confirmed this once again."
"Jacques Delors stated that, essentially, models of development must be achieved that are based on low consumption of non-renewable resources and that are reproducible in the long term."
"In 2001, the Swedish Presidency responded to these findings with the Gothenburg Strategy."
"Now, five years later, we see that the new Commission has chosen to ignore all of these findings that are so important to our survival. Instead, it has returned to completely outdated notions."
"This is evident from resolutions in which unimpeded growth is invoked as being the key to solving all the problems of today, while the third dimension - the preservation of ecological foundations - is no longer mentioned and the necessary balance between three dimensions is negated."
"The earmarking catalogue in the regulation on the Structural Funds includes, for example, a total variable of 71 for the environmental dimension."
"The Commission’s new slogan, that the Lisbon Strategy must be pursued in the direction of unimpeded growth, is simply wrong, because it is short-sighted, it lacks solidarity and it is irresponsible, because acting in this way shifts incalculable costs onto the next generation."
"We are glad that the Council does not take this line, and we welcome the Austrian Presidency’s new strategic approach."
"We hope that this will be adopted in the next few days and that it will genuinely be implemented in terms of concrete political action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the website on sustainable development that was started by the Commission on the 30 May is well-meant and very interesting - the same goes for the two other websites on climate change and climate control - but that does not lessen my criticism of this Commission communication."
"It does not contain a Sustainable Development Strategy, but a catalogue of measures introduced, individual problems and intentions."
"In taking this view I simultaneously endorse the main criticism expressed by the Social Platform."
"I also agree with this network that the cardinal problem here is the definition of political priorities."
"However, I would like to go even further and say that sustainable development is the democratic realisation of a social model, one in which each and every person can live independently and with dignity."
"In my view, sustainability means that on the ground, in Europe and around the world, more and more people increasingly have access to the conditions that are necessary to ensure peace, protection from violence, democracy, social security, unspoiled nature, education and culture."
"The Sustainable Development Strategy must therefore set out three priorities: the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; the combating of poverty and social exclusion in the EU; and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming."
"That means disarming, demilitarising and democratising economic relations and our societies as well as redistributing and redirecting flows of resources through structural change, restructuring the energy economy and of course reorganising the social division of labour."
"."
"Mr President, these questions show the European social model in flashing lights."
"However, the European social model is a mishmash that pleases no one: a bit of free market here and a bit of welfare state there, mixed with a little green posturing."
"The EU dictates that one size fits all and, judging by the identical wording of these group questions, one size does appear to fit all."
"However, in the Independence and Democracy Group, we realise that one size will never fit all."
"I am free to say that my party, UKIP, can never support the Lisbon Strategy, because it is the failed strategy of a Commission that has no legal right to dictate economic policy to my country."
"It is for this reason that the EU can never impose a sustainable development strategy on Britain."
"There is, however, a PPE-DE one-sizing problem."
"Last September, David Cameron was quoted in the as ‘fighting to end the EU’s damaging social role’ and leaving it to focus on ‘making the single market work properly’."
"Yet we now have a Tory MEP, Mr Bowis, asking how the EU will enhance its social role in economic policy."
"No wonder Mr Cameron’s pledge to leave the PPE-DE Group has become such a huge joke."
"Or, as I always say, ‘EU must be joking’."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"It will be essential to make the management of the new development instruments consistent with the Lisbon Strategy by providing for short-, medium- and long-term planning in order to achieve the objectives that have been set, namely efficiency, effectiveness and economy, focusing particularly on growth but without forgetting environmental protection."
"In our opinion, Europe’s sustainable development policies have a vitally important role to play abroad, especially in developing countries, since in many cases it is precisely in those countries, where, unfortunately, there are no economic alternatives as yet, that the indiscriminate exploitation of resources occurs."
"The new policies must therefore be based on a feasible project for sustainable development that all peoples in the world can enjoy without distinction."
"For the world’s sake, Europe’s institutions need to send out signals of political convergence based at last on solidarity and aiming at reducing the indiscriminate exploitation of non-renewable resources. At the same time they need to commit themselves to promoting research and development in the field of environmentally sound technologies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when the Lisbon Strategy was reviewed, you decided to keep it separate from the sustainable development strategy."
"I think that this was a mistake."
"These two tools are more than complementary; they are inseparable from one another."
"That is why, at present, the impression created is of your adopting an ideological stance without taking action."
"It cannot credibly be proclaimed that sustainable development is one of the three pillars of the Lisbon Strategy unless the necessary bridging clauses are created."
"As for the content of the action platform presented after considerable delay by the Commission, I have to say that I was disappointed in it."
"We were expecting more substance and more proposals."
"Sustainable development now sounds hollow."
"Commissioner, I may be somewhat jumping the gun and anticipating our institutional agenda, but your work programme for 2007 will have to take up this challenge."
"I would ask you to be firmer, more incisive and more audacious in your dealings with the Council."
"Yes, the Commission must be audacious and courageous, as it is not being at present."
"It forever censors itself, confronted as it is with a paralysed Council that has nothing more than good intentions, never translated into action."
"Where energy is concerned, it should be emphasised that nuclear energy is no longer taboo, but it must be accompanied by renewable sources of energy."
"When it comes to biofuels, Member States – in particular, France and Sweden - are known to be working on these, but on different systems."
"What has become of harmonisation?"
"No progress is being made."
"Where are the practical proposals?"
"They are there in people’s minds but, unfortunately, that is where they remain."
"As for the Council, I am inclined to tell it to rationalise the instruments available to the EU: the Cardiff process on the integration of environmental aspects into other policies, the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy and the recently revised Lisbon Strategy."
"Frankly, hand-to-mouth policy needs to take a back seat in favour of visionary policy that considers tomorrow and makes sustainable development a key factor for the future."
"Mr President, my main problem with the Commission’s environmental proposals is that they do not correspond with the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Plan."
"As far as traffic is concerned, the Sixth EAP stressed the decoupling of transport goals and GDP goals."
"However, the Commission’s new strategy does not propose legally binding measures and deadlines."
"It is all very well to speak about wanting fewer private cars and more environmentally friendly public transport, but without legally binding measures these are only empty words."
"If we want to have less air pollution and more public transport, we have to act."
"As the rapporteur on urban environment, I propose legal measures and targets to increase the rate of environmentally friendly transport."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council will return to the policy of clear targets and measures."
"Listening to Mrs Grossetête, I also hope that the PPE-DE Group will support my amendments and my report about having binding measures and targets concerning the urban environment and traffic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to rural development."
"It is important that we do not lose sight of rural spaces as a whole as an aid to economic development."
"This means that in financial respects too we must ensure that sufficient means are available."
"Unfortunately the so-called second pillar of rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 has been reduced by EUR 20 billion in comparison with the proposal by Parliament and the Commission, and that reduces possibilities of development."
"That is why we must surely make use of the optional modulation system of 20%, I mean by redirecting funding from the first to the second pillar."
"We also have to ensure, however, that we give our support to the international development of rural spaces."
"In order to do this we need a fund that can be accessed on an international basis for rural development projects, in a similar way to the existing European one."
"Only in this way will there be a chance to develop rural spaces as a whole."
"Mr President, sustainable development is a nice idea."
"It has the pleasant aroma of the Norway of Dr Brundtland, who invented it 40 years ago."
"It is a notion from the good old days, from the Club of Rome, from zero growth."
"It is a new version of the old idea of Pastor Malthus."
"At the banquet of humanity, there is not enough room for all of the generations."
"We must therefore restrict ourselves, because the ice is melting, the water is rising, the greenhouse effect is going to suffocate us, the sun is going to burn out and raw materials are going to run out because the Chinese are consuming everything."
"In fact, the only thing that is sustainable is under-development."
"Look at Africa!"
"The only sustainable thing is poverty, which is a socially transmitted disease passed on from generation to generation."
"Development, on the other hand, is purely provisional."
"The stone age did not come to an end because of a lack of stones, but because of the invention of bronze."
"The oil age will also come to an end, not because of a lack of oil, but because we will move on to the age of fusion or of hydrogen."
"In short, sustainable development is an absurd notion, dreamt up by the rich to explain to the poor that, in order to save humanity in the future, they must go without today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, sustainable development is something obviously desirable that we all seek."
"Who could possibly be opposed to it?"
"Strategy and approach have great significance for the future prosperity of Europe and the world where these issues are concerned."
"They are linked together rather than integrated."
"The resolution originated in Gothenburg five years ago and emphasises certain components needed for turning the Sustainable Development Strategy into a reality."
"More emphasis could have been placed on the way in which strong economic development can increase the opportunities for creating smart technology."
"Innovative environmental solutions too may require investment if they are to be profitable."
"The administrative dimension is emphasised to an unnecessary degree in the resolution, which sometimes shows too little appreciation of the realities of the business world."
"Most of the resolution can be implemented, but the market perspective should not be lost."
"I say this in my capacity as the person appointed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to take responsibility for this issue in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"When the leitmotif of the resolution was the merger of the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy, we had difficulty voting for it, but we now think that there is an acceptable compromise."
"We are not opposed to the strategy."
"On the contrary, we unreservedly support sustainable development in trade and industry, environmental work and society in general."
"We cannot, however, encourage a merger of the Lisbon and sustainability strategies right now, since the former, unlike the latter, is already in use."
"We are not, however, closing the door to such a merger for ever."
"Following the review that has now been carried out, we think that the resolution has acquired a tone that we can, in general, support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great satisfaction that I note that the motion for a resolution recognises that growth and sustainable development are not opposites but, on the contrary, preconditions of each other."
"Sustainable growth is the only growth we can afford."
"The fact that the motion for a resolution extends sustainability to include areas in addition to the environment also constitutes great progress."
"The environmental and social dimensions should be integrated into our understanding of sustainability as elements of equal value."
"In that connection I should like to emphasise that sustainable development also involves equality between the sexes."
"Women at present earn less than men throughout Europe and are not represented in decision-making bodies to the same degree as men – be it in political, economic or public life."
"Any strategy on sustainable development must take account of this inequality and of the fact that social problems affect men and women in different ways."
"The common goals of both the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy cannot be achieved unless the issues of inequality and of the better use of both men’s and women’s potential are addressed."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all know that it is no longer a time for lamenting the consequences of our mistakes."
"The world ecological crisis is hitting us full in the face and I will not list the problems arising within this context."
"We here are well aware, more than anyone else I am sure, how urgent it is to act and to make courageous and wide-ranging political choices."
"And what are we seeing, since this is what is important?"
"That the Commission and the Member States use and abuse the rhetoric on sustainable development, sometimes cynically, to justify non-sustainable policies."
"I shall take the example of biodiversity, the common theme of our very survival, as you know very well, Mr Pröll."
"Since we have waged a real battle here to obtain budgets for biodiversity in the financial perspective, since we have said that the Natura 2000 programme would be taken into account in the Structural Funds, an argument used to justify not creating a new budget line, could you tell us – and this question is for the Commission, which is not listening – why biodiversity has not been included amongst the priorities of FEDER and why biodiversity has not been provided with any budgetary contribution?"
"I would therefore really like to know who is sabotaging sustainable development in these institutions?"
"And if there is sabotage, how much faith can we have in the strategy that you are presenting to us?"
"Mr President, in connection with the motion for resolution tabled before us, please allow me to say a few words about the relationship between sustainable development and energy economics."
"The document rightly points out that energy production and consumption is one of the key factors in achieving sustainability."
"We are also right when on this basis we reformulate – like we have done so many times in the past – our goals in respect of increasing energy efficiency, reducing the proportion of greenhouse gases or even supporting renewable energy resources."
"At the same time, it is obvious that we are lagging behind significantly in respect of the further development of the sustainable development strategy adopted in 2001 in Gothenburg."
"Therefore, it is worth considering why we are in this situation."
"I am convinced that one of the important obstacles to achieving our goals may be the lack of an efficient market economy environment."
"The motion for resolution encourages us to exchange national experiences, and therefore, if you allow me, I will illustrate this with a Hungarian example."
"In Hungary, where the extent of utilisation of renewable energy sources is, unfortunately, one of the lowest in the European Union, the long term operation of polluting energy production facilities is protected by monopolistic situations and contracts that contradict market logic."
"As a result of these contracts, coupled with the unpredictable regulations concerning the compulsory electricity acquisition quota of the state, which also contradicts market logic, the utilisation of wind energy, for instance, is rendered practically impossible."
"And while this practice is in use, the chances of achieving our goals concerning sustainable development are very slim."
"Therefore we need to develop an efficient, competitive and cost effective energy market, because without this, an environmentally sustainable society remains an unattainable dream."
"The Gothenburg strategy will only become real if this is achieved."
"In this hope I support the motion for resolution, and trust that we will be able to return to this issue when Parliament debates the development of the Common European Energy Policy."
"Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives are mistaken."
"We now have growth without jobs, so it is the wrong way to obtain more employment."
"We are also aiming at the wrong goals."
"With people now earning approximately EUR 12 000 per year, the link between increased income and greater happiness is ever more tenuous."
"Instead, the result is increased stress, more environmental damage, wider social disparities and more injustice."
"Sustainable development is not only about the environment. Achieving it involves, rather, seeing the environment as being inseparably linked to social conditions."
"Today, everyone is talking about sustainable development, and tomorrow we are to vote on the Seventh Framework Programme that allocates EUR 4 billion to research into nuclear power."
"More money is also going to research into carbon-based energy and to research into other non-sustainable forms of energy."
"Why is that the case?"
"The UN Climate Panel has shown that we can only achieve the Kyoto objectives by halting the subsidies to fossil fuels."
"People listening to us are amazed."
"Why do we not take the relevant decisions?"
"It is because the lobbyists from the big companies obtain their cherished short-term growth solutions, which are inimical to sustainable development."
"We must listen more to our audience and less to our lobbyists. Then, we shall obtain sustainable development."
"– Mr President, since last December the Commission communication and other contemporary publicity channels have been confirming the speed of global changes and the new dangers, as well as the opposing trend towards permanent and balanced three-dimensional development which links economic growth and quality of life with social integration and environmental protection."
"Therefore, by proposing the framework of the basic principles of the European Union sustainable development strategy in a manner which supplements the Lisbon Strategy and is divided into six basic sectors, an attempt is being made to integrate sustainability into European policymaking, both in the form of an internal dimension and by including the external repercussions of decisions and choices on the planet as a whole."
"Today, we in the European Parliament want our motion for a resolution to exert an effect on decisions by the other institutions."
"We are confirming our political and humanitarian sensitivity and our awareness of our responsibilities towards future generations by advocating an effective evaluation of the repercussions on the sustainability of all EU initiatives."
"The resolution is clear."
"We welcome the Presidency's interest, but we are calling for a single, cohesive and concise framework which will rally public opinion and policy-makers around common aspirations."
"We hope that the general objectives will be supplemented by specific, people-orientated measures, which is why we must be sure to define progress indicators to measure the benefits to man as an undeniable and unique value."
"Economic prosperity, high living standards and the ecological repercussions from the uniform dissemination of objectives on the potential of the natural world only make sense if they serve present and future citizens."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at the end of this debate I would like, as a summary, to give an overview of the items and goals that we have tried to coordinate with the Sustainable Development Strategy during our Presidency and on which we now want to reach a decision in the next few days."
"I would like to give my very heartfelt thanks for your suggestions and also for the speeches and the debates that we have had here together."
"Our aim with the Sustainable Development Strategy has been to put sustainable development for Europe at the top of the political agenda and in doing so to make Europe an example for others."
"We have been keeping all the Council configurations busy, and in recent months we have tried very hard to work through the essential points with the European Parliament and now to present them as a strategy."
"This strategy is, in our view, the result of very wide-ranging discussions and ambitious negotiations."
"Seven key challenges with goals and measures have now been clearly set out in the strategy, and this will enable the European Union to confirm even more clearly our role as a frontrunner in international cases."
"The most important chapter is of course - and this will also enable us to measure, to a certain extent, the success of the Sustainable Development Strategy in the coming years - a strong and clearly structured chapter on implementation, which provides for responsibilities and competences regarding the monitoring of progress in implementation and very clearly addresses all EU institutions and political levels, EU-wide, national, local and regional."
"I also regard – and we should do this together – the Sustainable Development Strategy as complementary to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Both strategies strive, with differing priorities and timescales, towards sustainable development."
"We want to demonstrate, too, that quality of life and high levels of environmental quality and social cohesion are important factors in safeguarding long term competitiveness."
"Sustainable development is a central factor in innovation: it creates opportunities and the potential for intelligent growth and better jobs."
"Sustainable development is anchored in the treaties; it is an overarching objective for all European policies."
"It confronts us, however, with huge challenges, above all in institutional terms."
"On an EU level we do not yet have appropriate structures with which to discuss this horizontal issue in the corresponding committees or to better coordinate the opinions of different committees."
"During the negotiations on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy we finally attempted an ad hoc solution with the 'Friends of the Presidency' group."
"At Council level we will be working, until the first review of the strategy, on possible options offering suitable mechanisms for sustainable development."
"This institutional question concerns all EU institutions equally, and it would give me great pleasure to encourage a dialogue between institutions, one that goes beyond the decision on the Sustainable Development Strategy."
"We regard the Sustainable Development Strategy not, as it were, as the end of the debate on sustainability in Europe, but as an important starting point in conjunction with the Lisbon Strategy in moving towards sustainable development in Europe."
"I would like to thank you once again for your very constructive cooperation, not only – I am saying this as the Austrian Presidency of the European Union nears its end – in the field of sustainability, but also for all of the constructive cooperation between the European Parliament and the Presidency."
"For me personally and in my areas of competence, discussions have always been very fruitful and successful."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to thank everyone for this very interesting debate."
"The debate shows that this subject is a central issue for Europe and that it is a priority which the Commission believes can contribute towards improving the quality of life and preserving resources, especially for the benefit of future generations."
"It goes towards improving the economic, social and environmental dimensions of our way of life."
"The Commission’s proposal has emphasised and given added relevance to the underpinning principles of our sustainable development policy."
"Moreover, we have given ourselves clear objectives with correlative actions to reach these targets."
"Concerning the need to be more ambitious, and the call for new targets, I need to underline that the essential thing is to produce results."
"Investing in new targets may not be too difficult."
"However, it is much harder to get people to make and accept the changes needed to achieve those targets."
"We are meeting our existing targets, but the real challenge is to ensure that we do so."
"We are therefore proposing a new approach aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are needed for sustainable development."
"Having said that, I agree that setting new targets is also important."
"However, any new targets need to be established through a proper process involving impact assessments and full stakeholder consultation, so that we have the acceptance and the commitment of those who need to work in order to achieve those targets."
"I would also like to say something about the integrated approach frequently mentioned during the course of this debate."
"Sustainable development is about a coherent approach to policy-making."
"It requires an integrated approach, and in practice this means the Lisbon Strategy working hand-in-hand with the sustainable development strategy – two strategies working in parallel and in coordination towards the overarching objective of sustainable development."
"The Commission disagrees with the idea of merging the two strategies, but agrees they should be used in parallel towards achieving the overall goal of sustainable development and that they should be complementary, both in scope and in terms of governance."
"The Commission agrees that they can go hand-in-hand, though this does not mean that they have to be integrated."
"This can be achieved through sound and effective complementarity between the two, and that is what the Commission’s communication seeks to achieve."
"Concerning governance and monitoring, improving the governance of the European Union’s sustainable development strategy is key to pushing forward progress."
"That is why the proposal for the review of the strategy proposes a new improved governance process."
"The Commission will report on progress every two years."
"Let me assure you that in doing so it will draw on the full range of sustainable development indicators."
"Eurostat has made good progress in developing indicators and this work will continue."
"The aim is not to name and shame, but to assess where we are, how much more we need to do, and in which areas, in order to enable us to determine where we need to act and to allow clear communication to electors and stakeholders on where we need to change and on our approach to this."
"Concerning the international dimension, sustainable development requires a global approach."
"The European Union should maintain its position as a world leader in sustainable development through its action at home and by addressing the effect of this."
"It must also engage with others to achieve the commitments made at Johannesburg and the Millennium Development Goals in order, as has been said, to allow developing economies to leapfrog, to avoid old-fashioned unsustainable patterns of development and to use clean and innovative technologies."
"This is essential, for example, in the drive to limit climate change."
"It is also why the global dimension is an integral part of the reviewed European Union’s sustainable development strategy and why that strategy advocates an integrated approach to development and external policies."
"In conclusion, the Commission hopes that the interaction between us in this area can continue and intensify in the months ahead."
"To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution(1) has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The next item is a statement by the Council and a statement by the Commission on the increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this issue that we are now dealing with in this plenary is one that we consider to be particularly important."
"Whenever the security and dignity of a citizen of the European Union is threatened, then we are all threatened."
"The credibility of our Union and its principles and institutions are at stake here."
"The Union – and this was made very clear in this morning’s debate – is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and basic freedoms and constitutionality."
"This is anchored in the founding treaties, and since then it has been restated in numerous institutional agreements and in numerous legal acts."
"We must therefore consider acts of racist and homophobic violence as direct provocations, and we must take decisive steps against them."
"We must not allow people who are citizens within our own Union to feel like outsiders, and neither can we allow it, if people from other parts of the world who come here have experiences that contradict our values completely."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, the Union has – with directives on equal treatment laid down in the year 2000 – created a set of instruments to prevent or rather to combat discrimination across the Union, whether on account of ethnic background, religion, or of sexual orientation, among others."
"On the basis of these two directives, the Community Action Programme to combat discrimination 2001-2006 was set up."
"In doing this, the European Union makes it very clear that in dealing with this matter it will not limit itself to passing legal statutes, but will take sweeping measures in order to implement anti-discrimination policies."
"You know these measures, I do not need to go into detail here."
"I would, though, especially like to emphasise the great significance that we all attach to the activity of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in this context. For those in positions of political power, its findings provide an important basis for decisions."
"Allow me to continue here a point that I already made this morning."
"We believe that it would be a fair acknowledgment of these efforts towards equality and against discrimination and racism, if we were to create a fundamental rights agency, a separate agency that tackled these issues."
"The concern of this agency would be to ensure that we, in the Member States, in the institutions and in official bodies, observe the rules that we have in the European Union, rules that have become part of the ."
"This is not about carrying out general human rights investigations and setting ourselves up in competition with other institutions, in particular the Council of Europe. It is, rather, about the fact that we, as a Union, need an institution with the job of implementing measures that were decided here."
"I repeat what I already said this morning, namely that in my opinion this planned human rights agency would fulfil this task. Civil society – our fellow citizens – wants and needs this agency."
"We know that in the field of combating forms of intolerance, below the level of the Union, there are a great number of worthy national initiatives, both public and citizens’ initiatives."
"These initiatives are striving to promote awareness, to bring different groups together in order to remove prejudices or, in the case of young people, using educational means to prevent prejudices from ever arising, which I regard as particularly important. They deserve our full support."
"Where we have to recognise, however, that positive initiatives, education and awareness are not enough to stop violence or its precursors – intolerance and incitement – then our Member States must make use of legal proceedings in order to protect their citizens."
"The States of the European Union have criminal law procedures that are thoroughly appropriate for dealing with the challenges of racist and intolerant patterns of behaviour."
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council believes that a European framework decision on the combating of racism and xenophobia would be an important signal and an important step towards the completion of the relevant European instruments."
"Work on such a framework decision began in 2001, although there are still problems, due to the Member States’ historically developed criminal law systems."
"Work here is difficult, and until now a definite result has not been achieved."
"In the light of the serious and dangerous challenge represented by racist and homophobic violence, decisive leadership is needed from those in positions of political power – especially from the Presidency of the Council."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Plassnik, I myself, and other representatives of the Austrian Presidency, have been and are trying to provide this leadership."
"Thus on 21 March of this year, on the 40th International Day for the Elimination of Racism, Mrs Plassnik declared, among other things, that: ‘The worldwide struggle against racism is by no means won – in the EU, too, there is no cause for self-complacency.’"
"Earlier, on 17 March, at an event dealing with this very issue, I myself said: ‘The contribution of local and regional bodies to the protection of minorities and to measures against discrimination is particularly essential.’"
"I also drew attention to the situation of the Roma minority, who are unfortunately often targets of discrimination and racist violence in the European Union."
"On 5 May, the national Austrian day against violence and racism, the President-in-Office of the Council commemorated the liberation of Mauthausen concentration camp as well as the people from over 30 European nations who were brought by the Nazis to Mauthausen, where they were degraded, tortured and murdered."
"That should remind us where intolerance and racism lead - and this European Union must ensure that it never happens again."
"Honourable Members, I would like to give my heartfelt thanks – and also personal thanks, since I have been working on this issue for many years – to this House, for having put such an important item on the agenda; and I would like to assure you that the Council greatly appreciates your dedication in this matter and that it will be working with you hand in hand."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a matter of principle, the Commission opposes all form of racism and xenophobia and will continue to channel all its efforts into the fight against these phenomena, as laid down in the Treaty."
"Today more than ever, this task should be a priority at all levels – international, European, national and local."
"The Commission is bitterly disappointed that the Member States have yet to adopt the Commission’s 2001 proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia."
"The aim of this proposal is to ensure that all forms of racism, including racism on religious grounds, are subject to punishment under criminal law in all Member States."
"The Commission is once again urging the Council to adopt the proposal without watering down its effectiveness, and is striving to reopen the debate on the proposal, the adoption of which would be a major step forward in combating racist and xenophobic crime."
"The Commission hopes that the seminar on the fight against racism and xenophobia, organised together with the Austrian Presidency and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) and to be held on 20 to 22 June, will lead to reopening the debate in the Council under the Finnish Presidency."
"The Framework Decision is not the Commission’s only initiative in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"For example, the Commission supports the EUMC’s work by gathering data on the extent and development of racism in the EU."
"The fact that the EUMC is becoming a Fundamental Rights Agency will not have a detrimental impact on current activities, given that the fight against racism and xenophobia will remain a fundamental goal of the new agency."
"On the contrary, I am convinced that this fight and our efforts will in fact be strengthened."
"The Commission is also striving to ensure that the Member States fully and correctly implement the anti-discrimination regulations that have been adopted, and it is heading a series of programmes and initiatives such as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007), which will contribute towards the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"The Commission has undertaken to continue and step up these activities, and it is determined to extend its future efforts in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"The Commission is also firmly opposed to all forms of homophobia."
"Homophobia runs counter to the principles on which the EU is founded."
"It is necessary in this regard to point out that the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms expressly forbids any form of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation."
"The Commission would like to mention its statement of January 2006 in Parliament."
"In the context of its powers, the Commission stands firm in the fight against homophobia."
"A key element of that fight is combating discrimination and the EU has already taken steps in that direction, for example with the adoption of Directive 2078/EC."
"The Commission is also aware that the legislative measures must be accompanied by further initiatives aimed at effectively combating discriminatory, derogatory, stereotypical and degrading behaviour."
"To this end, the Commission is also contributing by means of information campaigns and initiatives such as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007)."
"All things considered, the Commission is convinced that the EU, which at its core strives for deeper solidarity between nations, must set an example in the fight against discrimination and must take a lead in the fight against all forms of racism, xenophobia and homophobia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I await your debate with interest."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity."
"By coming together, our countries decided to uphold and to promote these values."
"Each political group has decided to table a resolution to follow up the statements we have just heard;"
"I personally have drawn one up on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Almost every day we see evidence that the fight against intolerance is far from won."
"I would have preferred to deal with this subject in a different manner."
"It is appalling that we still have to point out publicly that racism in our societies is intolerable."
"Numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks have taken place in recent times in our countries, and that is unacceptable and intolerable."
"While as citizens we must remain vigilant, as elected representatives we must stand firm and vigorously condemn this behaviour; to stay quiet would be tantamount to accepting it."
"We must also adopt laws to protect our fellow citizens – political will is crucial in this area – and countries that have not laid down anti-racist and anti-discrimination laws must do so."
"I shall repeat what I said yesterday in this House and what I have been saying for some months in committee."
"The Council must immediately stop blocking the framework decision against racism and xenophobia, otherwise fine words and good intentions will serve no purpose."
"Our respective governments must offer an example and move forward in this fight for equality, respect for others and tolerance."
"As for the current situation, it is unfortunately necessary to point out that we are seeing a rise in far-right parties in many of our countries."
"Although I personally am fully committed to this fight, I understand my group’s reasons for not signing the joint text: this text clings on to ideological positions that have become obsolete."
"These countries will not be moved forward along the path of rigorous respect for the Union’s values by our condemning any particular current situation."
"It is unacceptable to confuse individual cases of aggression perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments."
"We must distinguish between these situations."
"It is dangerous to lump everything together."
"We must separate this issue from the debate relating to any particular motive."
"The fight against racism, xenophobia and homophobia is not a matter for the left or for the right; that is something we must accept."
"That is why the joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow seems to me to be a balanced compromise."
"I shall end by saying that I very much regret that Parliament is reluctant to speak with one voice on this subject."
"This is an opportunity missed, since I know that this is a fight that all of us here in Parliament share in."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was elected into the European Parliament 12 years ago, I would not have thought it possible that we would have to have such a debate yet again."
"We were considerably more advanced in Europe then than we are today."
"It is an alarm call that, in today’s European Union, we have to address the question of how we can combat and get to grips with increasing racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and hatred of minorities - whether of an ethnic, religious, or sexual nature."
"That is why I, as leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, am making a statement in the name of all of the members of our group."
"European social democracy – Christian Democrats in Europe, Conservatives, Liberals, democratic forces on the left and on the right – those who stood at the cradle of the European Union: they knew why there had to be a supranational solution to the conflicts at the end of the first half of the 21st century."
"Therefore let us think back once again: what were their motives?"
"What had caused the European catastrophes of the First as well as the Second World War, but above all, the catastrophes of fascism and Stalinism too?"
"Hatred of minorities, a racist feeling of superiority, the exclusion of people who did not conform, the disabled, those of different sexual orientation, people who could be stigmatised as enemies, in order to channel general discontent and direct it onto scapegoats, those who came from somewhere else, who took our jobs."
"I do not want to repeat all that here, you already know it."
"These people with racial madness, religious madness, were the firebrands of the first half of the 20th century."
"What, then, have we set up instead?"
"A solution based on integration, on a community of values and laws, and on basic rights for all: no matter what religion they have or whether they believe in God or not, no matter what race or skin colour they have; no matter where they come from, no matter what convictions they have or do not have, no matter how they wish to live their individual lives, whether on the basis of family, alone or in whatever partnership they choose, that is up to them."
"What binds us together is that – in our richness, in our superiority - we can organise a society that says ‘yes’ to a community in which each person has his or her own place: Catholics and Muslims, Protestants and Jews, black people and white people, heterosexuals and homosexuals, heads of families and those who live alone."
"Why should anyone turn race, sexual orientation, or belief into the subject of a political debate at all, except as a means to an end - namely, to succeed in one’s own political aims by victimising a minority."
"That is the most repulsive thing that European history has ever seen, and that is what led to this inhumanity."
"We do not direct our criticism at any one country, because unfortunately we have the same phenomenon in all the Member States of the European Union - not only in the new Member States, but in the old ones as well."
"The criticism that we are adopting here is not directed against peoples or states; it is directed against the intellectual deficiency of those who propagate such ideologies - no matter where they are in Europe."
"They have no place anywhere, not in any society, and, I hope, not in this House either!"
"Mr President, unfortunately this debate is indeed still necessary."
"In the resolution you will find a list of names of individual victims, people who were killed only because of the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation."
"In the 21st century in Europe that is barbaric and we should be ashamed."
"I am, on the other hand, proud to be a Member of this House that stands up against those kinds of barbaric acts."
"Intolerance is on the rise everywhere, and my own country is no exception in this regard."
"I therefore welcome all the mass demonstrations we have seen all over Europe in favour of tolerance and equality and, most recently, the very successful equality march in Warsaw."
"I was very happy to be part of that."
"Tolerance, anti-discrimination and equality are not national, internal matters."
"If it is anything, the EU is a community of values, and if we are a community of values, then we should be discussing these matters at European level and we will not accept that Member States hide behind the argument of subsidiarity, because that is only a pretext."
"As I said in the debate yesterday evening, the EU needs an ambitious strategy to become the world champion of fundamental rights."
"We should be just as ambitious in this area as we are when it comes to the economy and things like the Lisbon Strategy."
"We do not need to weep crocodile tears: we need action."
"We do not need to be timid and reluctant when it comes to intervening in matters that are going on in the Member States."
"I am therefore very happy to hear that the Council will speed up the work on the framework decision and the Agency on Fundamental Rights."
"I would very personally like to address a word to the President-in-Office and to call for the recognition of gay people as victims of the Nazi regime."
"That has been mentioned before in this House."
"I am also happy to hear that the Commission is willing to instigate infringement procedures and is considering a horizontal directive."
"Finally, we should not hesitate to use an instrument we have at our disposal, namely Article 7, in cases where a Member State or a Member State government fails to comply with EU principles."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome the strong statements that we have heard from the Council, the Commission and my colleagues in the House, and wish that other politicians would be as clear and as forthright as they have been in their condemnation of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other hate speech and hate crimes."
"As has already been said this afternoon, the list in this resolution is a sad one, but it is not exhaustive."
"We could have added the tragic murders of young men in the United Kingdom recently, and it is clear that no EU Member State is free from this hatred."
"But I do not think we should be seeking to remove countries’ names from resolutions."
"This week, we took a very brave stance on Guantánamo;"
"I think we should be doing the same thing when we come to look at what is happening within our own Member States and be absolutely clear that we are not going to tolerate that either."
"It is very easy to be brave about third countries; it is much more difficult to be brave, in some respects, about your own, and I think that is a shame."
"People on European soil have the right to live free from violence; they have the right to live in peace; and that, I believe, is unequivocal."
"The political response of governments and other institutions to racist and homophobic attacks is crucial and sends very strong signals."
"It took numerous deaths in the United Kingdom, and one in particular, before our police services realised that they were institutionally racist and set out to change that."
"It is still a long, slow struggle but progress is under way."
"If we are going to speak out, we also need to be critical of some of our media, which is also determined, it seems to me, to sow hatred rather than information and integrity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continual homophobic attacks in Europe are a symptom of a crisis in democracy that this Parliament needs to address, above all when they take place in European Union Member States such as Poland."
"The far-right Polish Government, which is suppressing the civil rights of the homosexual community, needs to realise that such conduct is incompatible with membership of the European Union."
"The recent gay pride march in Warsaw was only authorised because of pressure from Europe."
"Poland must understand that, if homophobic attacks continue, my group will not hesitate to call for possible political sanctions for breach of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and of the fundamental democratic principles of the Union."
"It is also crucial that the 2001 framework decision on racism and xenophobia be extended also to cover the crime of homophobia, a legal category that already exists in France and Belgium."
"I am disconcerted by the Austrian Presidency’s failure to move on these issues and I wonder whether it may not be due to the fact that Mr Haider’s neo-fascist party forms part of the government in Vienna."
"I challenge the Council, which is present here today, to say something in that regard."
"I therefore hope that the Finnish Presidency will inject some civilised attitudes into this Europe that has fallen prey to dangerous new fiends."
"."
"Mr President, justice requires reason and prudence."
"So while racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and dislike of Muslims or Christians are lamentable facts of life in certain European countries, we have to be very careful when comparing and generalising these phenomena in the course of political debate."
"Otherwise, we may achieve the opposite of what we intended and contribute to aggravating rather than calming the conflict."
"The motion for a resolution on racism and homophobia contains too many contradictions and unjustified generalisations and this can have just such an effect."
"It is not right to throw racism and so-called homophobia and Islamophobia into the same pot."
"That is mixing real discrimination based on race or religion with an opposition towards ideology, which is justified in democratic political discourse."
"Our liberal colleague from the Netherlands is quite humble when it comes to assessing tolerance in her country."
"Recently a paedophile political party was legalised there and I would like to ask: how much further will tolerance go in that country?"
"The post-Communists who are speaking so freely here would do better to look at their own record of tolerance instead of picking on Poland."
"It is grotesque that this resolution juxtaposes regret over the lack of comparable data on the phenomena mentioned above and general judgments about the countries where they manifest themselves."
"Why should Parliament publicise its sloppy work in this superficial draft of such an important document if we have been dealing with these phenomena for many years in committees within the Council of Europe?"
"In ratifying paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 11 in the current version, Parliament would simply lose credibility in the fight against racism and discrimination."
"I would like to appeal to all those of you who are motivated by genuine concern for justice to avoid false comparisons and unjustified generalisations."
"."
"Mr President, this is an important day for the European Parliament because this debate, and especially the resolution potentially resulting from it, may create a new trend in the just fight against all kinds of racism and persecution of minorities."
"However, let us for God’s sake not allow it to become another weapon in the political campaign conducted by the left and the European liberals against the political parties that lean towards the right and countries where right-wing parties have come into power."
"I strongly protest against the proposed formulation in paragraph 4 of the resolution, which levels serious allegations at my country."
"They are deadly serious allegations from a moral and political point of view and include xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and a lack of tolerance in Poland."
"One thousand years of Polish history surely prove beyond all doubt that Poland is the most tolerant country in Europe."
"It is a country that will never allow its good name to be dragged through the mud with impunity."
"We protest against the lies and hypocrisy of the left."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz, together with his socialist colleagues, has joined the ranks of the Polish post-Communists in kicking up a fuss about the fate of homosexuals in Poland."
"Does he know of any cases of intolerance towards homosexuals?"
"If not, what is all the fuss about?"
"Apparently a member of the League of Polish Families advocated the use of violence against gays."
"This allegation is now the subject of a complaint filed by the member against the newspaper which printed the claim."
"This Parliament would make itself a laughing stock if it were to protest against a statement that was never made."
"We must check our facts first."
"He said that the police should prevent illegal demonstrations, by force if necessary."
"When the post-Communists were in power, illegal gay parades were protected by the police."
"Now they are not."
"We have a government that is determined to uphold law and order."
"Yes, we are against promoting homosexuality in Poland."
"We are against promoting immoral behaviour."
"We clearly differ from Mr Schulz in our judgment of what is or is not morally acceptable."
"He would be better off fighting intolerance in his own country."
"I am old enough to remember German intolerance towards Poles during the Second World War."
"There are still examples of lamentable intolerance in Germany today."
"Mr President, I would like to support the statement made by Mr Gaubert, my colleague from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that this House has missed the opportunity to speak with one voice and to support the resolution he has drawn up."
"This document highlights the kind of mechanisms that should be introduced in the European Union: constant monitoring of racist crimes, the introduction of a framework directive and the creation of an Agency for Fundamental Rights as soon as possible."
"These should be priorities in our debate and in our resolution, rather than the slinging of mud at certain countries and cases, as seems to be happening here."
"The European Union is trying to uphold the highest human rights standards."
"That is the aim of the Agency for Fundamental Rights which is to be set up soon."
"Already, a report is published annually by the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia on the subject of racism and xenophobia in the European Union."
"It is worth looking at the 2005 report."
"Under point 5 on racist violence and crime there is an assessment of the situation in the 25 Member States."
"What can we learn from this text?"
"In four European countries, including Italy, Mrs Agnoletto, there is a lack of publicly accessible official data on incidents of racist crime and violence."
"Amongst the new Member States, the report states, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia collect official data on racist violence and crime on a broader scale than other countries."
"We lack a unified European system for registering these crimes, and this makes it difficult to carry out comparable analyses of this phenomenon."
"Over 52 000 incidents of a racist nature have been registered in the United Kingdom, thanks to an efficient system for recording such statistics, 6 400 incidents have been registered in Germany, 1 565 in France and 209 in the Czech Republic."
"This disproportion shows how important it is to introduce a unified monitoring system."
"The majority of the 25 European Union Member States, we read, have transposed the Anti-Discrimination Directive into their own national contexts."
"In July 2000 complaints were filed at the European Court of Justice against four countries, including Germany, Mr Schulz, for not fulfilling their obligations concerning the directives on racial equality."
"Mr President, our duty today is to make a commitment, to speak out against this return to hate, xenophobia and homophobia."
"All over Europe we are horrified to see odious acts and we are hearing hateful words and incitements to violence."
"I would repeat: all over Europe."
"It is therefore our duty to say ‘that is enough’, that we will not tolerate any more such acts of violence, that these horrendous attitudes are contrary to our values and the foundations upon which we have built our Europe."
"We must put an end to racist, xenophobic and homophobic crimes for good, whether they be against a man or a woman because they are black, against a young man because he is Jewish, against a young man because he is North African or against a woman because she is trans-sexual."
"It is our essential duty to silence all of those who preach this vile ideology."
"We all know where it leads: to the abyss and to horror."
"Furthermore, we must stand firm against the incitements to hate expressed by Polish leaders against homosexuals."
"To this end, I welcome the tolerance and the joy of living together shown by the Polish people on the occasion of the Gay Pride event in Warsaw."
"This is my solemn appeal: let us stand up, for these are grave times."
"All we have to do is count the resolutions that we have adopted on this issue to little effect, since the situation has only worsened."
"We must now move on to actions."
"The States must mobilise themselves against the hate that is re-emerging on their soil."
"The Union must accept the seriousness of the situation and make this fight a priority."
"We will not be able to say in the future that we did not know what was happening."
"It is now that we must act, all of us together, urgently and without delay."
"I would therefore call upon the Member States to reach an agreement on the framework decision on racism and xenophobia as soon as possible."
"The time has come to act."
"Mr President, here we have yet another resolution condemning racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic acts, a resolution which is unfortunately justified given the exceptional and alarming levels of hate and intolerance that we have been seeing in the European Union for some years."
"The facts are horrendous and they have been mentioned by previous speakers: racist attacks – all forms of racism taken together – are increasing dramatically."
"Article 2 of our joint motion for a resolution mentions the most recent ones: in Anvers, on 12 May 2006, Oulemata Niangadou was murdered because she was black, together with little Luna for whom she was caring."
"In France, Ilan Halimi was abducted, tortured and murdered because he was Jewish."
"We could spend days discussing the causes of these barbarous acts."
"The first, in my view, is the fact that many of the arguments have become hackneyed."
"There are those who use the ‘we must not fan the flames’ argument. There are those who preach the infamous ‘quest for social peace’."
"There is also a certain culture of keeping quiet as well, increasing the sense of impunity felt by the perpetrators of these xenophobic acts, and above all there are the arguments that inflame people’s attitudes."
"I shall give one specific example, though there are others, of this great tendency to resort to hackneyed arguments which paralyse people and prevent the public authorities from acting in good time."
"In 2004, in France, the advisory committee on human rights stated that anti-Semitism was the cause of half of the physical and verbal attacks in the country."
"Nevertheless, it has taken two years and the murder of Ilan Halimi for the French citizens to realise that a culture of anti-Semitism is proudly displayed in certain suburbs, amongst a minority, it is true, but a very active and particularly indoctrinated minority."
"Two years too late, two years that should have been spent speaking out, condemning, integrating and bringing people together."
"My custom is to end on an optimistic note."
"I could, for example, mention Recital I and say that we must work towards educating people to respect others, to hold dialogue and to show tolerance."
"It is an obvious and essential duty: knowledge with a view to recognising the full wealth and differences of others."
"I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, in order to contain the increase in racism, we must begin, to paraphrase Albert Camus, by daring to call things by their name, we must identify who is provoking them, and we must have the courage to face the truth."
"My constituency in the north of Ireland has seen a number of violent attacks on communities from other Member States and from further afield, as well as a consistent level of homophobic violence."
"We also experience ongoing sectarian attacks, such as the recent murder of a 15-year old Catholic boy, Michael McIlveen."
"It is absolutely vital that the Council now adopt the 2001 Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia."
"I would echo calls for the Finnish Presidency to restart work on this with all urgency and, as we have heard today, for the Council to adopt the decisions without watering them down."
"National governments and other institutions must respond adequately."
"Mr President, I believe it is important that we all use this opportunity to highlight the unfortunate rise in racism at football matches in Europe."
"FIFA, the world’s governing body for football, has said that there has been a recent upsurge in discriminatory behaviour towards fans and black players, an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing by many European clubs of players from Africa and Latin America."
"FIFA has stated that there is a deplorable trend in the increased level of racist attacks in Europe."
"This is not in any individual country; it is everywhere."
"It is unfortunate if people pick one place or country to highlight this."
"Racist incidents that have taken place at European football matches include the following acts: monkey-like chanting, derisive singing, the hanging of banners that reflect neo-fascist beliefs and the tossing of banana skins on to football pitches."
"In all, more than 30 billion television viewers are expected to watch the World Cup that has just started."
"I welcome the fact that FIFA is going to use that tournament as an opportunity to crack down on racist acts at football matches in Europe."
"There are a number of things it intends to do."
"Because of time constraints I will not list them."
"However, I believe it is important for our own Commissioner for Sport, Mr Figeľ, the Finnish Presidency, the EU and the European Parliament to look carefully over the coming months at how we can highlight this unfortunate trend."
"I also believe that players have a huge role to play in this."
"They are very influential with fans and they can have a hugely positive impact on getting people to stop that kind of behaviour."
"Mr President, racism is a result of people who want to rule over others as they are convinced of their own superiority."
"Racist violence and other discrimination due to social background, old age, illness or religion cannot be combated using racist methods, especially here at the European Parliament."
"That is why I strongly protest against the vilification of Poland, Poles and the Catholic radio station, , which has increased in particular since the right took control of the government."
"The right has been ferociously fought by the international liberal socialists who, having the worldwide press under their thumb, tarnish the good name of Poles, accusing them of xenophobia, anti-semitism and homophobia simply because the majority of my compatriots believe in God and uphold traditional values."
"The perfidious lie that has been spread by the anti-Catholic media is the alleged criticism of the radio station by the Holy See. is the only independent medium in Poland with a worldwide audience, something I wish applied to all media, which respects the truths of faith, defends life and real freedom and promotes truth, human dignity and human rights."
"Poland was, and is, one of the most tolerant countries, where for many centuries those persecuted in other countries have been welcomed."
"That is why adopting the resolution stating that there is anti-Semitism, xenophobia, racism or homophobia in Poland is a scandal, and would indicate that there is racism and xenophobia in the European Parliament."
"As Polish Catholics we are offended by these insults and, not for the first time, feel discriminated against."
"This is something that should not be happening, particularly here in the European Parliament, which prides itself on respecting the ideas of tolerance, democracy, respect for diversity and freedom of belief."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to join in the emphatic and unqualified condemnation of any kind of violence, of course."
"In fact, we should come down hard on all perpetrators of violence, wherever they may come from."
"That is beyond dispute."
"Secondly, I should also like to point out, though, that violence committed by isolated individuals must not ever lead to a witch hunt on people and parties who have nothing to do with that violence and who, using only peaceful means, flag up the dangers and enormous problems of immigration that is on far too large a scale and that has grown, in fact, out of everyone’s control."
"Thirdly, I should like to add that this House is once again showing little evidence of reasonableness."
"The joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow is simply not worth the paper it is written on due to its grotesque exaggerations and of it mixing up violence on the one hand and legitimate criticism of the unworkable multicultural society on the other."
"It is also, on account of its plea in favour of further curbing the free expression of opinion, worryingly undemocratic."
"Mr President, I have seen and heard homophobia vaguely, on TV and so on, but listening to some of our Polish colleagues speak here today, especially Mr Roszkowski, Mr Pęk, Mr Giertych and Mrs Krupa, well that is homophobia if anything is!"
"It is absolutely stuff!"
"I am glad that I have a of good, sensible, rational Polish friends, because if that is liberal history, then for goodness sake, I do not want to see what right-wing conservativism is!"
"Sorry about that."
"To me this resolution is about four things."
"It is about the fight against racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia."
"First, we already have a resolution on homophobia, which was signed by all of the political parties, and I am indeed very glad about that."
"Second, it is clear that racist violence has increased in Europe and we cannot just sit down and watch it."
"We need action."
"We need action from the Commission, as Mrs in ‘t Veld said, and we need action, as many have said, from the Finnish Presidency."
"My third and final point is that when I came here I thought that the resolution should not name any countries or political parties."
"I am still trying to believe that it should not do so, but if someone wanted to put the country of Poland into this resolution, I think that after hearing this debate there is no question as to why it was done."
"Because I am a big friend of Poland, I still think it should come out."
"Mr President, European history places a particular responsibility on the shoulders of politicians, the churches and civil society in terms of protecting tolerance and human rights."
"This responsibility weighs especially heavily on the shoulders of the governments of European Union Member States, which should guard the rights enshrined in the European Treaty."
"Unfortunately some, I repeat, some actions of the current government in Warsaw, especially those related to the League of Polish Families, are spreading intolerance and homophobia."
"The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Roman Giertych, sacked the director of the National In-Service Teacher Training Centre because of its publication of an official Council of Europe guide entitled ."
"The Deputy Prime Minister alleged that the book, and I quote from the press, ‘encourages schools to hold meetings with gay organisations’."
"Roman Giertych is considering the need to shut down this institution, which has been in existence since 1991 and which is an important institution in Poland responsible for drafting and implementing educational programmes based on humanist values."
"Fortunately, these actions by the government have roused another part of Polish society."
"One hundred and forty thousand people have signed an Internet petition calling for the dismissal of the Minister for Education."
"Teachers and pupils are protesting, and a new civil society is on the rise."
"We have defined homophobia as an irrational fear of otherness, a fear of something that one is not familiar with or that one does not want to become familiar with."
"Opposition to homosexuality is simply a form of opinion based on inveterate prejudice."
"It springs from the roots common to racism, xenophobia, hatred towards people of different beliefs and religions, and other phobias."
"In the case of homophobia, what we are faced with is a traditional form of prejudice, often stimulated by the media and misused by populist politicians."
"It manifests itself in a wide spectrum of actions, from hate speech and incitement against those who are different to calls for discrimination against individuals and actual inequality in legislation."
"At times, such politicians can command widespread support, especially when they choose to link homophobia with nationalistic chauvinism, religious zeal, contempt for ethnic minorities and so forth."
"Because such ideas can fan the flames of hatred, particularly in economically deprived areas, it is our duty to warn of the illegality of homophobia and acts of racism."
"Eradicating prejudice is, however, only one of the objectives in educating people in tolerance towards those who are different, and can complement other types of education in tolerant behaviour."
"The European Parliament can identify the dangers of homophobia, and expose its protagonists, but it is ultimately the responsibility of individual Member States to take measures to stamp it out."
"– Mr President, unfortunately, cases of racism and violence are increasing, both in terms of intensity and frequency, not only in Poland, but also, unfortunately, throughout Europe."
"We need to condemn various racist crimes but, in light of both past resolutions and current Community legislation, this is not enough."
"The legislation and daily administrative practices of the various Member States foster intolerance and discrimination to such a degree that we can talk of institutionalised racism."
"The Member States need to apply practical measures to combat racism."
"Public opinion-makers must not create a climate of racism."
"Prosecution of groups that foster racism must be encouraged."
"Racism is a multisided, multidimensional problem."
"That is why composite measures are needed to combat it, measures which both prevent and cure."
"We need to combat both racist perceptions and the social exclusion that fosters the development of racism."
"Mr President, we should take this opportunity and, at the same time as acknowledging the rise in racism, xenophobia, homophobia or any other kind of oppression, we should avoid putting a premature end to the discussion by stating that it should not be taking place at all."
"Instead, we should think about the reasons for this increase, for it is this kind of reflection that has been lacking in this House."
"There are a number of groups other than those mentioned today which are also oppressed."
"I think that all Europeans in the European Union are being oppressed by having enlargement, in the form of Turkey’s accession to the EU, forced upon them."
"Another oppressed group is that part of society which has a traditional Christian outlook, which does not have anything against homosexuals but which is shocked by gay parades."
"Why are parades necessary?"
"They are also a form of oppression."
"Mr President, I am saddened by what I have heard here this afternoon from our Polish colleagues from the League of Polish Families and the Law and Justice Party."
"I have heard from them about the promotion of hatred, the promotion of discrimination, the promotion of evil."
"We have heard family and religion used as a reason or an excuse."
"There is no reason, and there is no excuse, for the promotion of hatred."
"I have heard traditional values referred to."
"What value is there in diminishing the lives of ordinary human beings?"
"There is none."
"This House was built on the ashes of the Second World War."
"When it was built we vowed that no minority would ever be scapegoated again."
"We stand by that."
"We will defend that."
"I was in Warsaw on the march that your Government tried to ban."
"Let me say to you: the reception that we got from those decent, ordinary people confirmed to me that your two parties do not represent those decent ordinary men and women of Poland!"
"Mr President, we have a huge and inexcusable gap in EU action."
"Our citizens must be very puzzled."
"On the one hand we have good laws and a new strategy to outlaw discrimination against people as employees and consumers."
"However, the EU is failing to outlaw hate crimes against people as people."
"It is failing to delivery security from fear, even though we talk a lot about creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"President Barroso enjoined us this morning to be proud of Europe and its values."
"So why is there a lack of action on hate crimes when Member States can agree criminal penalties for pollution crimes?"
"Is it complacency?"
"Is it ignorance?"
"Is it a lack of political will?"
"I hope to avoid any more high-flown rhetoric about a Europe of values while our leaders refuse to act."
"MEPs are agreed, including, I am glad to say, Mr Gaubert for the PPE-DE Group, in demanding that action."
"I would say to Mr Roszkowski that his mention of paedophiles in the context of sexual orientation is deeply misplaced and disgraceful."
"Nothing suggests that paedophilia is more prevalent among homosexuals proportionately – indeed it is probably the contrary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to draw up a joint response to the rise in racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic violence in our States, and to its consequence, the increasing expression of extreme-right views."
"It is our duty to hammer home, day after day, this message that we must combat all forms of hate and discrimination on the grounds of ethnic, racial or religious origin or sexual orientation: a duty of tolerance, a duty to teach our children, a duty to remember our history."
"That would be proof of our complete commitment to human rights."
"Horror is never far away."
"Recent tragic events have shaken our consciences and our people."
"It was not so long ago that a world war founded upon hatred for others devastated our continent."
"We must always remember that Europe rose from those bitter ashes, on the basis of values of peace and tolerance."
"We cannot allow any weakness or concession, including in this Parliament."
"We need strong responses, we must strengthen the legal instruments and rigorously apply those that already exist."
"It is essential to re-launch the work aimed at adopting the Council’s framework decision."
"We must stand firm and offer an example, since that is what our values require of us."
"In response to our Polish colleagues: it is possible to believe in God and not be homophobic."
"President-in-Office, if you have been subject to racial or homophobic violence you will never forget it."
"When my parents arrived in this European Union from India, we were not welcomed with open arms: we suffered regular racial abuse and violence."
"You never forget it once it happens."
"What I would say to my Polish colleagues, and to anyone else who doubts that action can be taken here in this House today, is that we want action."
"The Council framework decision is at the heart of this resolution."
"I would say to those colleagues who disagree about whether we should name individuals, I have to agree with it, because it is a deeply personal tragedy which you will never forget."
"However, I would say this to the Austrian Presidency: you can make this happen."
"It has been shelved so many times, but racist attacks can be solved, penalties can be increased, a political signal can be sent."
"Will it stop the hatred?"
"No, it will not."
"But you mentioned leadership, and leadership is what we seek today, because this scar on Europe today in 2006 is greater than when my parents arrived in this European Union in the 1960s."
"That is a deep shame."
"Let us do something about it."
"Mr President, it is with some dismay that I have studied the news that has reached us recently from countries both within and outside the EU."
"It goes to show that there are very unpleasant and dangerous trends directed against homosexuals among the peoples of Europe."
"One of the fundamental principles of a democracy is freedom of assembly, which is also safeguarded in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"This freedom is not always respected."
"In Russia, the Gay Pride parade was refused permission to go ahead, something that quite clearly is not only a breach of the Convention but also an insult to those who wanted peacefully to exercise their democratic right."
"We do not, however, need to look outside the EU in order to find similar examples."
"It is enough to take a look at Poland, where, from right across the political spectrum, there is an ever-renewed stream of homophobic statements directed against Gay Pride parades and the like."
"All this is entirely to be condemned."
"Religion is frequently used as an excuse."
"Certainly, freedom of religion too is one of the fundamental freedoms, but it should under no circumstances whatsoever be used as an excuse for oppressing others."
"That is something we cannot accept, either among people in the Member States or among our fellow MEPs here in Parliament."
"If, irrespective of the country we come from, we are to call ourselves democrats, we must vigorously condemn what is happening right now and do everything in our power to bring the oppression to an end."
"The issue is so important, however, that it should be asked whether the European Parliament is the right forum in which to debate it."
"What should not under any circumstances happen is for the issue of homophobia to be addressed for the purpose of making cheap political points."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my firm conviction that we can only be successful in dealing with this important issue – so essential to our own credibility – if we hold firmly to the values of this European Union of ours."
"We must be reliable and speak out with a united voice."
"It seems important to me and even vital that the institutions of the European Union, above all the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, are speaking the same language."
"Personally I do not believe that we will make progress if we try to accuse each other and reproach each other for failing, more or less, to observe the principles of respect and tolerance."
"We have to find a common language."
"I have heard a great deal today pointing in this direction, and for that I am most warmly appreciative."
"Mrs Lambert referred to something which I believe to be of crucial importance: the role of the media."
"We had a EuroMed conference in Vienna ten days ago at which, amongst other things, we discussed the role of the media."
"The consensus was that you cannot censor the media, you cannot tell them what to do."
"We cannot aim for a code or law to regulate what the law should or should not do."
"However, the media should have self-control over what it does, because it plays a crucial role."
"As far as I am concerned, in a democracy the independent media plays probably the most important role in conveying everything that has been said here in favour of tolerance, in favour of the fight against racism."
"That is very important."
"To Mrs in ‘t Veld, I would say that this is an Austrian matter."
"Ever since 2000 we have been working very vigorously on finding solutions for the Austrian Nazi victims."
"There is absolutely no doubt that victims of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation are considered victims of Nazism."
"To Mr Agnoletto, who unfortunately is no longer here, I would like to say that I very emphatically reject - and I do this with some personal emotion, too - the accusation that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is guilty - precisely on this question - of inactivity."
"I think Mr Agnoletto has not really been following the events of the last six months of the Austrian Presidency."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Sonik for having emphasised the activity of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna, and for having stressed the important potential role that the human rights agency could play in precisely this area."
"I call once again upon all Members to support the future Presidency of the Council in this issue, so that this European human rights agency can become a reality."
"It would play an important part in the fight against racism and for tolerance."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the concept of equality and tolerance has been part of European political thinking for centuries."
"I recall a Papal bull from the beginning of the 10th century, which opens with the words: ‘Does the sun not shine equally on all?’"
"Despite the existence of this concept, Europe has very often endured times of brutal intolerance, which have led to millions of deaths and people’s destinies cut short, not to mention those who have not been physically destroyed but who have lived under circumstances of intolerance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, some historical events have been mentioned, and I feel that the experience of history is of vital importance."
"It begins inconspicuously with gradual backsliding on standards of tolerance and equal opportunities."
"Such barely perceptible beginnings eventually give rise to movements with real political clout, with the disastrous results that they bring."
"That was why Europe established equal opportunities, tolerance and anti-discrimination as a cornerstone of its political thinking and of its political construction."
"In my view this is the most important value that forms part of the European project, as all the others are rather instruments."
"It is up to us to adopt effective measures at all levels wherever possible."
"This fight is not only a matter for Europe, for the Member States or for the various levels."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, this fight is a matter for every one of us as individuals."
"I therefore feel most encouraged by the ideas which have emerged in this debate, and which show that in Parliament there is a strong desire to support the effective, proactive implementation of the ideas of equal opportunities, tolerance and the fundamental rejection of racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia."
"To wind up the debate, six motions for resolution(1) have been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on"
"– the oral question (O-0014/2006 – B6-0225/2006) to the Council on small arms by Mr Brok and Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and"
"– the oral question (O-0015/2006 – B6-0226/2006) to the Commission on small arms by Mr Brok and Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"."
"Mr President, as our colleagues in the Commission and the Council know — and I thank them for being here today — we take improving the mechanisms for controlling European arms exports and the strengthening and strict implementation of the European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports very seriously, and we are also great enthusiasts and promoters of the idea of one day having an international arms treaty."
"Let us hope that that day is not too far away."
"These are all issues that we have had the opportunity to discuss on other occasions and we will continue to deal with them in the future."
"Nevertheless, today I would like to focus on a rather more specific issue: small arms and light weapons, which are currently the real weapons of mass destruction, to judge from their immense capacity to kill."
"I will give just one statistic: every minute, one person falls victim to a firearm somewhere in the world."
"By the time I finish this speech, therefore, there will have been five more such tragic victims. As far as this issue is concerned, time is not money."
"It is something much more important. It is life."
"You have some questions before you that were presented in writing by my colleagues Mr Brok and Mr von Wogau on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, respectively, whom it is my pleasure to represent here today."
"These questions relate to the next United Nations Conference to assess and review the programme of action on small arms and light weapons that will take place in New York from 26 June to 7 July, and the position that the European Union will take at that conference."
"Before getting into the issue itself, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the decision to include a representation from the European Parliament as an integral part of the European Union’s official delegation at that conference."
"This is unprecedented at this level, and it demonstrates the need to strengthen the mechanisms for dialogue amongst the three institutions and offers a perfect opportunity to establish a more coherent and more efficient European policy on arms control."
"At the preparatory meetings that we have held so far, we have noted, on the part of the Commission and of the Council – and I have always expressed my desire for institutional cooperation – that there is a great shared interest in what I believe to be a very great and increasingly close cooperation amongst the three institutions."
"I would therefore like to focus my questions on the following points: firstly, how does the Commission assess the preparations for the conference and how does it intend to ensure that the European Union’s strategy on light weapons is taken into account within the European Union's foreign policy?"
"And, secondly, how does the Council intend to approach the negotiations and what results does it hope to achieve?"
"At this point I would also like, naturally, to draw attention to the resolution adopted unanimously in this Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs and which will be ratified by plenary tomorrow."
"It contains the position that we, as the European institution directly elected by the citizens, would like you to take into account."
"I would repeat that I am pleased to note that, in the talks we have held, there is a very high level of agreement as to the issues that should be discussed at the conference: the inclusion of ammunition in the scope of the programme, a better definition of the control of transfers, the monitoring and marking of weapons, brokering, the relationship between development and disarmament – something which I know not just we, but also the Commission, are particularly concerned about – and finally the establishment of guidelines for following up the conference."
"I also believe that there should be more concrete measures for dealing with the possession of weapons and acquisition and, in any event, that is an issue that I would like us to discuss."
"With regard to this final point, although you are well aware of this, I must point out that this Parliament has insisted on many occasions that we would very much like the Union to take the lead, at international level, on the adoption of an international arms treaty."
"Although it is true that this is not the subject of the conference that we are talking about at the moment, we would like this conference to establish a basis for beginning to move towards that objective as soon as the conference is over."
"I would like to remind you that this is a request that has already received masses of support at international level, as confirmed by non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, Oxfam or Iansa, the promoters of the initiative."
"With regard to the role of parliaments in general, and of parliamentarians in particular, I would like to stress the increasing importance of these institutions in the process, not just as legislators, but also and this is fundamental in terms of controlling the actions of their respective executives."
"To this end, the Interparliamentary Forum on Small Arms and Light Weapons is doing extremely important work in terms of increasing the awareness and training of various parliamentarians with an interest in improving the mechanisms for controlling these exports."
"If you accept these objectives, representatives of the Council and the Commission, you can count on us to be great allies."
". () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to go into very specific detail about Mr Romeva I Rueda’s questions and I will try to answer them one after the other."
"I also want to thank you for your comments."
"In fact we are allies, since the objectives of the European Parliament and the European Council are in line with each other."
"As for the first question, on how the Council plans to cooperate with the Commission on preparations for a coherent and successful implementation of the Union’s strategy, in connection with appropriate funding: the strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition, adopted by the European Union in December 2005, concentrates on extending the capacities of the General Secretariat of the Council so that it may conclusively apply the strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of these weapons."
"The strategy also provides that the General Secretariat of the Council will proceed in this matter in close coordination with the Commission and the Member States."
"In our view this is very important, because the strategy calls for coherence and complementarity between decisions of the European Union in the framework of GASP and measures taken by the Commission in the field of developmental aid, so that there is a coherent underlying approach to all projects and interventions by the European Union in the field of small arms and light weapons."
"It seems to me that consistent policy between the institutions is of the utmost importance: only by being consistent can we remain credible to the world at large."
"I can give a positive answer to the second question, as to whether the Presidency of the Council will ensure that it sends a delegation of the European Parliament to participate in the UN Review Conference 2006, in order to add a political and parliamentary impetus to the proceedings: I myself will lead the delegation and I am looking forward to it, because I think it is very important that the European Union raises its profile on an international stage."
"The relevant Council departments have checked and approved the participation of Members of the European Parliament in this Conference, and I am pleased that Members will indeed be taking part in this Conference."
"As far as I am informed, you yourself will be taking part, I am pleased to say, and other Members will also be able to take part."
"In this way we will undoubtedly further emphasise the importance of this issue for the European Union."
"As for the third question – as to whether the Council is to propose the European Union’s 1998 code of conduct on weapons exports as a possible blueprint for the future Arms Trade Treaty, I can tell you that the Council’s publicised support for the Arms Trade Treaty is not intended as an attempt by the European Union to impose its own standards on the rest of the world."
"One could point out, however, that third states that strive towards modernising and completing their national export controls regard the EU code of conduct as an important reference document."
"I know that I too am subject to this temptation. If we think that we in the European Union have worked out some excellent rules, then of course we would like to see these rules adopted worldwide."
"We have to be realistic here, however, and act as an example; if we act as a good example, then other states in similar situations will view our code of conduct as a guide."
"In the framework of the Arms Trade Treaty, which represents an important project in humanitarian terms, as well as in terms of human rights, developmental policy and disarmament policy, the European Union is directing its efforts towards mobilising the widest possible supranational support for this."
"One of our main concerns is to improve inspections of transfers of small arms and light weapons for the European Union as a whole."
"Other major concerns are to make small arms and light weapons more traceable, so-called ‘marking and tracing’, tighter controls on the arms trade and punitive measures against illegal trafficking of ammunition."
"We are very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this matter and for the very close cooperation of the Commission, too; and I believe that at the Conference in New York the European Union will indeed give a good account of itself."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is set to play a central role in the UN conference aimed at looking into the issue of small arms and light weapons, although it will not take part in the talks on the formal documents."
"Some countries have a political interest in implementing the Treaty but lack the resources to do so."
"We are therefore channelling all our efforts into supporting practical implementation."
"In 2005 alone, the Commission spent over EUR 16 million supporting countries and populations affected by small arms violence."
"With this support, we also helped implement joint EU actions in 2002 and the EU programme for the prevention and prohibition of the illicit trade in conventional arms, and contributed towards the implementation of the EU strategy on small arms and light weapons."
"This formed the political framework governing the work of the Council and the Commission on this issue."
"The Commission’s contribution to the 2002 Annual Report on joint action in the area of small arms and light weapons includes more specific coordinating measures."
"The Commission’s ability to honour its commitments for 2007 will depend largely on the outcome of talks between the Council and Parliament on proposed instruments for funding Community actions."
"To this end, the Commission has tabled some sensible proposals."
"Whilst the Commission awaits a positive verdict on the main thrust of these proposals, its departments responsible for the policy on small arms and light weapons are working towards ensuring that awareness of the risks relating to illicit small arms and light weapons and of the preparedness of individual countries to address those risks forms part of the documents of their national and regional strategies."
"The Commission’s departments continue to work towards introducing into national and regional programmes standards and measures aimed at stopping the spread and accumulation of illicit weapons."
"It is worth pointing out, however, that the proposed measures give recipient countries, to a greater or lesser extent, responsibility for defining aid and for specifying a number of key action areas."
"."
"Mr President, we support the principle of the proposed international arms trade treaty."
"Small arms, in the wrong hands, prolong and exacerbate some of the world’s most brutal conflicts."
"However, we are under no illusions that so long as certain arms manufacturing nations remain outside the scope of international treaties, then oppressive governments, terrorists and insurgents and other organised criminal groups will continue to have easy access to weaponry."
"The British arms industry already operates to some of the highest standards in the world and the British Defence Manufacturers’ Association has said that it warmly welcomes the principle behind the international arms trade treaty."
"If other countries were willing to emulate the strict standards enforced by the United Kingdom, an arms treaty would certainly be a worthwhile asset and a boon to international security."
"However, responsible countries such as the United Kingdom and other EU Member States will only achieve a hollow moral victory if other less conscientious nations rush to fill the gap in arms sales left by our absence."
"The United Nations, and not the European Union, is the arena in which to pursue an international arms trade treaty and it must include as many countries as possible, and particularly China, if it is to have the desired effect."
"Amnesty International has recently identified China as one of the world’s major arms exporters, with increasing influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America."
"Chinese weapons have helped sustain conflicts and human rights violations in Sudan, Nepal, Burma and southern Africa."
"I am reminded that China also continues to stockpile enormous quantities of anti-personnel landmines."
"For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines, but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits, who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly."
"Usually, these have been armed rebel groups in developing countries which are supplied by non-Western countries."
"I think it is important, therefore, that when considering the matter of small arms, we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or legitimate traders engaged in transparent activities."
"Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are either sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources."
"That is the area on which we should now concentrate our attention."
"Let us also work hard to bring China and other such countries into the scope of an international treaty."
"."
"Mr President, small arms and light weapons are weapons of mass destruction in the developing world."
"It is estimated that they kill half a million people each year."
"Their long-term impact on sustainable development is undeniable."
"Fighting them means finding creative ways to bridge the gap between security sector reform and development assistance."
"The latest reports by the UN Institute for Disarmament Research on European action on small arms and light weapons stresses that the EU should create more synergies between the relevant CFSP and Community instruments."
"Also, fighting the scourge of illegal brokering should be a priority."
"This Parliament has repeatedly expressed its disappointment at the lack of specific legislation in many EU countries, despite the adoption of Common Position 2002/203/CFSP."
"Finally, the EU can play a decisive role in making sure that the review conference on the UN programme of action on small arms and light weapons is successful, and a follow-up conference must therefore be organised."
"We are counting on the Austrian Presidency to steer that process."
"Success would mean agreement on a global set of principles on arms transfers which, as a minimum, should ensure that all transfers are authorised through a permit or licence, that existing obligations and relevant international law are respected, that arms embargoes imposed by the UN Security Council are respected and enforced, and that the issuing of permits or licences should take into account the risk of exported arms being used in serious violations of human rights or international humanitarian law, including the risk that such arms might be diverted into the wrong hands such as those of terrorists and that this may affect regional or internal security and stability."
"The UN review conference should, of course, start work on a legally-binding international arms trade treaty as soon as its work is complete."
"I am very honoured to be a member of Parliament’s delegation to that review conference."
"– Mr President, I welcome this motion for a resolution on the subject of small arms, although I must say that when you consider the damage these things cause, the term ‘small arms’ makes them seem much too harmless."
"However, I should like to point out a few problems with this motion."
"It says, for example, that transfer of weapons should not occur if there is a risk that they might lead to violations of human rights or that they might promote national or regional instability and armed conflicts."
"To be quite honest: when is this not the case with weapons exports?"
"I think that the real problem is to differentiate between legal and illegal exports, because this is actually a grey area."
"One should, therefore, not only take action against illegal exports, but also against legal ones."
"Contrary to what Mr Van Orden says, one should certainly look at Member States of the European Union as well, since countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany are among the main exporters of small arms."
"I will just mention the example of Nepal."
"Weapons were exported from EU Member States to Nepal."
"Now these weapons have been used, and we now have this problem, to which the Council responded by saying that no one could have known that events would unfold in this way."
"It is precisely because we cannot know that we must ban legal weapons as well as illegal weapons."
"Every weapons export is a threat to peace."
"Mr President, with 80 million new guns manufactured each year, and one person killed by a gun every minute, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons fuels conflict, crime and terrorism across the globe."
"Five years after the UN programme of action was agreed, the forthcoming review conference must not just review: it must act."
"It should recognise key gaps, such as the transfer of small arms to non-state actors and, ultimately, ways of reducing the demand for small arms."
"It should address controls for licensed production deals, like that adopted for Austrian Steyr rifles in Malaysia."
"As Mr Winkler says, Europe can offer leadership in this debate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our code of conduct on arms sales."
"I hope the Council will offer new commitments to extend financial support to projects aimed at limiting small arms proliferation and their use – currently just EUR 2 million in the CFSP budget – and by building on the proposals for an EU strategy for security sector reform, started under last year’s UK Presidency of the EU and, indeed, at the Austrian Presidency conference on the western Balkans."
"Last year European Member States, as part of the UN, agreed a tracing instrument for small arms that was neither comprehensive – covering guns, not bullets – nor legally binding."
"This year EU representatives must show that we have the political will to go further to promote the proposal already endorsed by the Council and Parliament for a legally binding international arms trade treaty, and to ensure, both at the review conference this July and at the UN First Committee in October, a resolution to set up a working group to begin to make it happen."
"I have received one motion for a resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0224/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"In the view of the Council Presidency, what are the prospects of EU accession negotiations with Croatia being separated not only de jure but also de facto from the negotiations with Turkey, in particular with regard to the opening and closing of individual chapters?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to Mr Posselt’s question – one that has already been asked in this form – I can only confirm what I said before: there is no connection between different accession negotiations."
"Of course, because of the fact of scheduling accession negotiations with several candidate countries, certain parallels may arise."
"However, the accession procedures – the screening, the analytical test and, importantly, the negotiations – are of course carried out separately with each country."
"I would like to remind you that one of the fundamental principles of the accession negotiations is that every negotiation is based upon the individual achievements of the individual country concerned, and that cross-connections can not be made."
"The speed of progress in the negotiations depends solely on the extent to which the individual candidate makes progress in fulfilling the conditions for accession."
"A parallel has arisen, although mainly for practical reasons, simply because the Commission produced the first screening reports on Turkey and Croatia at almost exactly the same time, and so they were dealt with at the same time."
"Nevertheless – as was evident two days ago – they were treated completely differently and with entirely different results; and I believe that this connection may be broken again in the future – this connection does not exist in any case – if, for example, the European Commission proposes benchmarks to open the negotiation chapters for only one of the two candidate countries, and if these benchmarks are then confirmed by the Member States; or, if the two accession candidates fulfil these benchmarks at different times."
"We stand at the beginning of these negotiations; our next concern is Chapter 36 including other business; in other words, in practical terms and due to the rhythm of negotiations, the two are very soon likely to drift apart from each other."
"– () In theory, this principle of each country on its own merits has always prevailed, and yet in terms we have seen many cross-connections."
"I would like to ask once again: will the Council insist that the Commission deals with these two – quantitatively and qualitatively so very different - countries differently during screening, and will the Council complete their formal separation, since, when one considers Turkey’s recent threats on the issue of Cyprus, it is high time to do so?"
"."
"Mr Posselt, there will be no formal connection, and there cannot be one."
"There is no provision at all for such a thing, neither in the Rules of Procedure nor in Council practice."
"Nor do I believe that it is appropriate to demand such a thing of the Commission."
"Different rhythms of negotiation will come about automatically."
"As you are so right in saying, the speed of progress and the starting positions of the two countries are of course fundamentally different."
"Therefore - in practice - different speeds of negotiation are very soon bound to emerge."
"– () Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the one hand you are right in saying that there is no connection."
"On the other hand, however, it is precisely Croatia that is, at least in parts, surrounded by other candidate countries, potential candidate countries and others who still hope to become candidates."
"To what extent could the accession negotiations with Croatia affect this entire region of the Western Balkans, which urgently needs stabilising?"
"."
"I do in fact believe, Mr Rack, that the negotiations with Croatia have an important effect as an example to the many Balkan countries that – as I know from many conversations with their representatives – see Croatia as showing them the way."
"Croatia is going on ahead of them and there is no doubt that the progress it has made in terms of economic and social policy constitutes an incentive to the other countries in the Balkans."
"I would remind you that Croatia will be following Greece in holding the presidency of the South Eastern European Cooperation Process."
"This too is important, in that it makes it more likely that Croatia will exercise influence as an example to the other countries in this forum, which comprises only countries from that region."
"I personally have high expectations of the negotiations with Croatia, not least for the sake of the other Balkan countries."
"Since the statistics have, for some time, shown the Croatian economy to be making very good progress, the country would appear, in economic terms, to have been ready for accession some time ago."
"The only problems appear to be with the sluggish implementation of laws relating to the EU, where the process is hampered by the requirement that proposals for legislation be sent first to the Commission."
"Might it not be possible to give the Croatian Government some practical help with this?"
"."
"I believe, Mr Mölzer, that we are doing that."
"Croatia is getting very effective assistance from us, from the European Union, from Austria, from the Presidency, in its efforts, and we are in close contact on a very regular basis."
"Nor do I believe that it is fair to say that the Commission is in some way dragging its feet in this regard."
"The Commission is doing what it is required to do, and I also believe that the negotiations themselves are going very well."
"It goes without saying that Croatia will continue to receive assistance from us at Council level as it endeavours to become a Member State of the European Union."
"I can only agree with you that there has been not only an improvement in the economic statistics but also very much greater willingness on the part of the country and of its people and so the negotiations should not be too long drawn out; it is on that that we in the Council are building."
"In October 2003 the Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of the report on Trafficking in human beings: prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues (CNS/2003/0812)."
"Could the Austrian Presidency give more information concerning why the Council is yet to agree this?"
"The Council wishes to inform Mr Evans that it thinks it necessary to obtain further expert information on this issue, which has to do with how it is determined whether a piece of legislation is both necessary and called for from the point of view of society."
"The Council has therefore suspended negotiation on the proposal until such time as this information is available."
". The illegal trade in human kidneys has become a multi-million-euro industry, with European patients whose lives are at risk desperately trying to find donors on the Internet."
"In far too many cases they are just preying on poor people in developing countries."
"For those donors the motivation is money, not the health and quality of life the recipients can expect."
"In listening to your answer, President-in-Office, I would remind you that in too many cases that trade is linked to human rights abuses in the form of the involuntary removal of organs from prisoners due for execution in China."
"Three years after this was voted in the European Parliament, an answer that you are seeking more information from experts is really not good enough."
"I ask you to seek best efforts within the Council to unblock this very important proposal."
". I personally fully agree with you and I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Council share that view."
"I would like to point out that the proposal was taken off the agenda, not withdrawn."
"It is a proposal that is important but needs to be studied very carefully."
"But I have taken note of your sense of urgency and will certainly share it with colleagues in the Council."
"Will the Council give an opinion on the negotiations currently taking place between certain Member States and the Iranian Government in relation to nuclear capabilities?"
". Mr Mitchell’s question is, of course, very relevant to the present situation, and it is one that I am very happy to answer."
"Over recent months, of course, the Council has considered this issue in very considerable depth and, ever since the start of diplomatic efforts at resolving it, has adopted conclusions on the subject, most recently on 15 May."
"It appears to me to be quite vital to underline the fact that one of its concerns in doing this was to present the European Union as maintaining a united front, for any sort of long-term effect on Iran is dependent on its being seen to do that by the outside world."
"What that means is that the fact that these negotiations have, in the last few months, been in the hands of three Member States, should not conceal the fact that the Council as a whole, and Mr Solana, the High Representative, as well, have constantly been not only informed about them, but also involved in them, supporting them and endorsing the relevant conclusions."
"We have repeatedly expressed our profound regret at the Iranian Government's failure to take the steps regarded as necessary by, in particular, the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Security Council of the United Nations and at its threatening, until recently, to continue to refuse to take them."
"We have appealed to the Iranian Government to cooperate unconditionally with the IAEA."
"The Council has not disputed Iran’s right to use nuclear energy in a peaceful manner in accordance with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and, on the basis of the August 2005 proposals, reiterated in the February 2006 conclusions, the EU would be prepared – and it still is – to support the development of a safe and sustainable civil nuclear programme consonant with the principles of non-proliferation, provided – and this is the other side of the coin – that full account is taken of the wishes of the international community and its confidence restored as regards Iran’s intentions."
"The Council is still determined to bring about a peaceful solution by diplomatic means, and I believe that it has communicated and reiterated that in very clear terms to the world at large."
"The EU would welcome it if it were to be able to develop its relations with Iran on the basis of trust and cooperation."
"A few days ago, as you will be aware, the High Representative, Mr Solana, presented Iran with an offer package from the European Union that was also endorsed by the other Members of the Security Council – something that strikes me as particularly relevant – and the initial responses to it can be described as cautiously positive."
"We hope that this offer – which is a good one – will serve as a basis for achieving a peaceful resolution of this conflict, and that this potentially dangerous issue will very soon be off the agenda, so that we can achieve a comprehensive agreement and understanding with Iran, thus in turn making it possible for our relations with it to be developed in all areas."
"I welcome the efforts to resolve what the President-in-Office has described as ‘these dangerous developments’."
"What sort of a precedent is this setting for other mavericks in the near neighbourhood of Europe, if somebody who threatens nuclear development, makes xenophobic comments about a nearby state and threatens international security is to get a package?"
"Could the President-in-Office tell us what is in that package?"
"What has been the outcome of Mr Solana’s discussions and what response was received from the Iranians?"
"Could he give us some idea of exactly what is on the table and what is being offered to Iran in these circumstances?"
". The contents of this package are not openly known and it has also been agreed with Iran that the detailed content of the package will be treated confidentially for the time being, as long as these negotiations, which are at a very sensitive stage, are carried on."
"As far as the reaction of the Iranian side is concerned, I have said that the package was not rejected, which already is progress, because as we know, in the past, that whenever the European Union and other international players have made an offer, this was flatly rejected by Iran."
"Now this is being studied by the Iranian side and we can only hope, not only in our interests but also in the interests of Iran, that this offer will be accepted."
"When Mr Larijani first responded in public to Mr Solana’s offer last week, he said that the package offer contained some ambiguities."
"Can you give us any information about what those ambiguities are?"
"Have they been solved yet?"
"He also said that the European Union side has given weeks, not months, for a response."
"When are we expecting a response from the Iranians?"
". You have practically given the answer yourself."
"Firstly, it is not up to the Council to interpret what Mr Larijani said."
"If there are any ambiguities, we have made it very clear that he now has a fairly short time – just as you said, we are not thinking in terms of months but in terms of weeks – to clarify what these ambiguities are and what is necessary in order to clarify the European Union’s position."
"So we hope to hear exactly on which points the Iranian side is seeking more information, which we will give to them."
"I hope we shall be able to clarify those ambiguities to the satisfaction of the Iranian side."
"– Mr Winkler, the recurrent problem with the European Union in global political conflicts is that one or other of its Member States chooses to go its own way and tends to ally itself with the USA, thus going against European interests."
"Can it be guaranteed that, in the conflict with Iran, the European Union will speak with one voice and that all its Member States will support it?"
". The answer I can give Mr Mölzer is a very brief one, and it consists of a firm ‘yes’."
"I was present for all the debates in the Council, the last of which was only a few days ago, and I can tell you that all the Member States, without exception, are endeavouring to come to a common position on this matter, the need for which is being questioned by nobody, and that the European Union is very much united on this issue."
"In the context of the EU strategy for Africa and the Global Approach to Migration, the European Council, in its conclusions of December 2005, noted the increasing importance of migration issues for the EU and emphasised the need for a balanced, global and coherent approach that covered measures to combat illegal immigration and harnessed the benefits of legal migration."
"It pointed to the importance of ensuring that the appropriate level of financial resources was allocated to those measures and also recognised the importance of tackling the root causes of migration."
"Can the Council state what progress has been made towards attaining the objectives set in the Strategy for Africa?"
"In particular, what progress has been made on increasing public development assistance to 0.56% of GDP by 2010, with an additional EUR 10 000 million destined for Africa, on the granting of EUR 42 000 million debt relief to African countries, on increasing aid by up to EUR 1 000 million per annum in order to enhance trade, and on the adoption of economic partnership agreements with groups of African countries, which should act as development tools, promote regional integration and improve those countries' access to the European markets?"
"Let me say at the outset that it is a most especial pleasure to be able to answer a question from my old friend Mr Martínez Martínez, and I will readily do so, since, particularly over the past few weeks, the subjects of the strategy for Africa, combined with the issues of development and migration, have been right at the top of the European Union’s agenda."
"Migration has already been discussed this morning in the course of the debates on the future of Europe and on the preparation for the European Council, when I pointed out – as I do again now in response to this question – how important it is that we, when discussing migration, should concern ourselves not only with illegal immigration, important though that of course is, but also the necessity of turning our attention to the development policy dimension of this issue."
"Migration was a very important topic at the troika’s meetings both with the African Union and with ECOWAS, when it was confirmed that an EU/African ministerial conference would be held on migration, and agreement was reached with ECOWAS on the establishment of an working group on the subject."
"We attach great importance to the European/African regional conference on migration routes to be held in Rabat on 10 and 11 July, at which we will be giving special support to Spain, and preparations for this are far enough advanced for it to be possible to adopt a joint action plan."
"We also, in this context, attach importance to Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement, which makes mandatory the return of illegal immigrants and also makes provision for dialogue with the countries concerned, on which we, together with Mauretania and Senegal, have embarked."
"Tomorrow or the day after, the European Council will be adopting a resolution in favour of pressing ahead at greater speed with dialogue with Africa, which, it is envisaged, will involve ten countries in the west of Africa and four in the east."
"The intention is that these bilateral discussions and their outcomes should be backed up on a regional and Africa-wide basis, with a follow-up mechanism being established for the Rabat conference and a series of regional conferences held on this subject."
"Turning to your question on development cooperation, I would like to observe that the European Union’s monitoring report this year showed that the EU is steering the best possible course towards discharging the obligations into which it entered at Barcelona in March 2002 and increasing public development aid to the point at which it reaches a proportion of 0.33% of individual states’ GDPs and 0.39% of the average across the whole of the EU."
"I will take this opportunity to repeat that all the targets agreed at the Millennium Summit must, of course, be achieved."
"These are obligations that must be discharged in full, and, of course, the individual Member States have their own."
"Turning to the subject of the economic partnership agreements with groups of African countries, I am very well aware that the issue of such EPAs is quite fundamental in our dialogue with Africa."
"A few days ago, in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, while negotiating the ACP Finance Protocol, we made a particular point of giving undertakings on this issue."
"The Commission has declared its willingness to make funds available not only from the current European Development Fund but also from the next."
"We are aware of the most especial importance of this issue of economic partnership agreements with Africa and with developing countries generally."
"On the basis of the first general review, which is to be carried out in the second half of the year, we will be carrying out a complete analysis of the stage that negotiations have reached, and then we will be able to continue work without delay in what it is to be hoped will be a very efficient manner."
"Thank you, Mr Winkler."
"Your reply is satisfactory, of course."
"I simply wished to ask you how you believe it is really going to be possible to reconcile the commitments we have made and which you are reiterating with the financial perspective that we have approved, because it seems to us that the sums do not add up."
"In other words, it does not seem to us to be viable to maintain those commitments within the framework of the financial perspective, with the cuts that it implies."
"Furthermore, I would like to know whether you are personally going to be in Vienna for the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly that we are going to hold next week, because that is where we are going to be able to talk to our African, Caribbean and Pacific colleagues about the issue of the EPAs, for example, and I would also suggest and request that observers from the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly be invited to the Rabat Conference, because I believe that the presence of these parliamentarians will have ..."
"I will take particular pleasure in being present at this meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna, but it is unfortunate that my appearance there is scheduled for a day when other events are taking place, including the visit of the President of the United States to Vienna, so it may be rather difficult for me to reach the venue at all."
"I will, however, do my best, and am already looking forward to meeting Members of your House and parliamentarians from the ACP states."
"Turning now to the issue of financial resources, I would first like to point out that the European Development Fund is not part of the European Union’s Budget; on the contrary, these resources are provided by the Member States from their national budgets."
"I would also like to point out that the amount in this tenth EDF is equivalent to an increase of over 35% against its predecessor; even though there were renewed negotiations and discussions in Port Moresby concerning the sums involved, that is still a quite considerable increase."
"What we are talking about here – and this is something that must be brought home to the public – is the sum of EUR 22.6 billion over six years."
"I do believe that, in doing this, the European Union is fully discharging its obligations, not least its moral obligations."
"Moving on to the agreement to increase aid to Africa by EUR 10 billion, the intention is that this should start in 2006 and run until 2010."
"At present, it is probably premature to pass overall judgment on the European Union’s keeping of this promise."
"I do believe that the tenth EDF is a good package and contains sufficient funds for the needs of the developing countries in Africa, in the Caribbean and in the Pacific."
"A very great deal will also depend – and this too needs to be emphasised – on how these funds are deployed, which must be done in an efficient manner."
"It is a recurrent experience that the end of a period sees considerable amounts of money left over, and that means that we also have to improve the capacity for these funds to be used, which has to do not only with the amount, but also with the way in which these funds are used."
"We are working on this, and so, in particular, is the Commission."
"Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree with me that there are selfish as well as selfless reasons for refocusing our effort on the developing world?"
"Within a generation there will be two billion more people on this earth, 90% of whom will be born into what is now the developing world."
"We will indeed leave a terrible inheritance to our children if we do not ensure that the current situation changes."
"On the other hand, these people could become our trading partners."
"Is the Minister aware of China’s activities in the developing world?"
"Is the European Union going to stand by and allow China to become the trading partner of the developing world within a generation?"
". Let me say to Mr Mitchell that, first of all, I do not feel qualified to make moral judgments here as to whether we are selfish or not, but, yes, it is very much in our interest to help those countries."
"It is not only a matter of trade, it is also a matter of global security and it is a matter of migration, which we have talked about today and during the last month and will talk about again in the future."
"There are many ways in which it is in our interests for those countries to develop."
"There is absolutely no doubt about that and we should not do it just because we are so generous, although we must be generous and I think that we are."
"As far as China is concerned, that is a very interesting point."
"Just a week ago, I led a Troika mission to China and we had a very interesting political dialogue with the Chinese."
"One of the issues we talked about was exactly that: China’s activities, in Africa in particular but also in other developing countries, especially in the fields of energy and trade."
"We said we are concerned that the values we share – and that we hope China also shares – as regards good governance and human rights are not respected."
"So this is an issue that we are very much aware of."
"We raise it in relation to our partners and we have raised it, and will raise it again, in relation to China."
"– There is no doubt about the fact that economic partnership agreements are a positive step in attempting to curb immigration as such, and illegal immigration in particular."
"With this in mind, is consideration being given to coupling these agreements with provisions on the return of illegal immigrants?"
"Are you thinking along these lines?"
"."
"I can tell you, Mr Rack, that the return of illegal and other immigrants is an open question, and I cannot say whether it will be formally tied in to the economic partnership agreements; the Commission is engaged in negotiations on the subject."
"That this is something that both the Council and the Member States would like to see is not, however, a matter of doubt, and it is of course something towards which the Commission is also working."
"Agreements between the EU and Russia on visa facilitation and readmission were signed at the EU-Russia Summit on 25 May 2006."
"After the signing of the agreement on visa facilitation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that this decision was the first step towards the introduction of a visa-free regime for citizens of Russia and the European Union."
"What is the EU’s position on this statement?"
"What guidelines have been laid down for future EU policy concerning a visa regime for citizens of Russia and the EU?"
"Will the agreement on visa facilitation set new trends in policy on EU-Russia relations?"
"The visa facilitation and returns agreements signed at the summit with Russia in Sochi on 25 May – to which reference was also made in yesterday’s debate on the Sochi summit – were negotiated with the intention of making it easier for people to keep in touch with each other and travel between the European Union and Russia."
"That is not only in Russia’s interest, but also in our own."
"It is also the intention that this agreement should, in harmony with the timetable for the development of the single area of freedom, security and justice, ensure that people can cross borders lawfully and without problems and stay legally in both areas."
"According to this timetable, these agreements – which must first, however, be ratified and implemented – are to be seen as a first step in a process aimed at making the free movement of persons, and their return, easier."
"Furthermore, the timetable envisages the dialogue on visas with a view to examining the conditions for the introduction of bilateral exemption from visa requirements being moved forward, albeit as a long-term project without a definite point in time being specified."
"The dialogue between the European Union and Russia on visa matters will be continued on this basis."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I would like to ask you another question."
"In the agreement signed in Sochi, there is a sentence saying that both parties reaffirm the intention to establish a visa-free travel regime between the Russian Federation and the European Union, so my question is: do you really believe that it is in the interests of the European Union to have a visa-free regime between the Russian Federation and the EU?"
"If yes, then what are those interests?"
". To be quite honest, I cannot answer this question today."
"As I have said before, this is a long-term perspective."
"There is no answer today, because there are many aspects to this question – there are not only aspects of external relations, but also questions of migration policy – and the situation will have to be closely observed both by the Council and the Commission to finally come to conclusions."
"This is certainly a matter of years and is not something that we need to decide today."
"I would like to ask the minister a question."
"During the Austrian Presidency, the European Union took the decision to raise the visa fee to EUR 62."
"This doubtless will not affect ‘new Russians’, but will reduce opportunities for ordinary Russian citizens, not to mention Ukrainians, Belarussians and residents of other non-EU states, to visit European Union states."
"As it holds the EU Presidency, how does Austria view this step and what does it believe the consequences will be?"
"."
"I will start with the issue of the increased visa charges, which have become necessary as a consequence of the introduction of biometric data, which have made the grant of visas and the processes leading up to it a good deal more complex."
"However, I hope it will answer your question when I say that, in the discussion on the increase in visa charges, the possibility of derogations was conceded not only for the countries of the Western Balkans – who are a particular priority of the Austrian Presidency – but also for those countries to which the European Neighbourhood Policy applies on the grounds of the great importance of both of them."
"The relevant legal act therefore includes, among other things, the provision that the visa fee for nationals of those states with which visa facilitation agreements have been concluded, of which Russia is one."
"As you will be aware, efforts are being made to conclude visa facilitation agreements with other countries as well."
"I have already had occasion to observe today that visa facilitation agreements with the countries of the Western Balkans will, if at all possible, enter into force next year."
"There had previously been concern that the countries with which we want to maintain particularly close relations should not have to suffer the increase in these visa charges, which were to be – and have been – imposed for reasons that are objectively perfectly understandable."
"President-in-Office, I am in the process of trying to get a visa for Russia."
"It is an extremely cumbersome process: it takes 15 working days and it costs EUR 71."
"For me, the most difficult regulation is that you have to have a passport photo in which you do not smile."
"We cannot find any of those."
"Nevertheless, my question – which is slightly dangerous, as I come from Finland, which has a border of 1 300 km with Russia – is: what is your educated guess about the timetable for a visa-free zone?"
". I would like to ask Mr Stubb whether he has ever tried to get a visa to the United States, whether smiling or not."
"It is probably more difficult than it is to get a visa to Russia!"
"In response to your question, I am afraid I cannot make an educated guess."
"I beg your indulgence."
"I really cannot give you an answer."
"I am not the representative of the Council of the European Union for this area."
"I am not in the business of speculation and I would prefer to refrain from any speculation on this point."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together."
"Does the Council agree that biofuel production must take place in a sustainable manner that does not endanger biodiversity, avoids conversion of natural habitats into intensively cropped land and ensures that the entire production cycle both within and outside the EU, including transport of the fuel, is at least carbon neutral, and what is the Council doing to ensure the certification of sustainable biofuel production?"
"What progress does the Austrian Presidency hope to achieve on the basis of the biomass action plan and the strategy for biofuels put forward by the Commission?"
"What potential benefits does the Austrian Presidency see for European agriculture in the increased use of renewable raw materials, including the increased use of biomass and biofuels?"
"The issue of the sustainability of biofuel use is generally an important one in terms of the European Union’s sustainable energy strategy."
"The fact is that we have, during the Austrian Presidency, put down a deliberate marker to the effect that Europe must, in future, as a matter of fundamental political principle, make better progress where the sustainability of biofuels in concerned."
"The action plan for biomass and the EU biofuels strategy involved us having communications submitted to us, which were discussed in depth and taken forward by the Council as appropriate."
"The issue under consideration is how, in future, biofuels may be used as an admixture or as new fuels for general purposes."
"We see it as an indisputable truth – and as one that we must join together in communicating throughout Europe – that the production of biofuels and bio-propellants of every kind, ranging across the whole spectrum from biodiesel to ethanol, cannot work if it is detrimental to the environment."
"Here in this European Union of ours, the production of biofuels, too, must be founded upon the principle of sustainability."
"Having visited plenty of environmental conferences over the last few months, I can tell you that it is also important that we should take care that consideration is given to the sustainability principle in the international trade in biofuels, which are produced using the whole range of methods and the most varied raw materials."
"During the Presidency – and particularly at the meeting in March of this year – we have discussed how to take Europe’s energy policy in a new direction, with particular reference to fuels."
"In a conclusion dated 8 June this year, the Council and the Commission called for proposals to be made concerning the promotion of the cost-efficient and sustainable use of biomass for heating and cooling purposes, for the revision of the legal provisions applicable to animal by-products, for the use – since biogas is going to be a live topic in the future – of by-products from agriculture and food production to be promoted as a source of renewable energy, and for an evaluation of the possible extension of the rules on energy crops to all the Member States; these are the cornerstones for the way energy is to be organised in the future."
"That is vital, particularly in the aftermath of the enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States."
"The Commission has also announced its intention of submitting a communication on the energy crops rules by the end of 2006 – which I see as a key date – and that this communication would include practical proposals for this sector."
"What I mean by that is that we, in the agricultural reform of 2003, with a view to sustainability and to the creation of a new source of income for rural areas in Europe, took steps to make use of 1.5 million hectares of sustainable raw materials for the whole range of alternative forms of energy in all areas, and it has to be clear to us today that we are very far from making full use of those 1.5 million hectares."
"The potential is there, and may well become even greater, and we await with interest the results of the evaluation and the Commission’s proposal, and, in both the Agriculture and Environment Councils, we will, over the coming months and years, have to give in-depth consideration to the challenges of a sustainable energy policy, for sustainable and renewable energy production is the key to Europe’s independence in energy and to its future projects in the field of energy production."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, I am very glad that the Austrian Presidency has been particularly active on that."
"I should just like to come to the question of certification, which was in my original question."
"This morning Commissioner Piebalgs mentioned, in a question-and-answer session, that there would be certification to underwrite the sustainability of biofuels."
"Certainly there has been anxiety over illegal logging and certification being difficult to get right in practice, even if it looked good on paper."
"I should be grateful if you could give me a little more detail on that."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a very warm welcome to you, and I would like to ask you whether the Council is giving consideration to how much more is to be invested in research and development in this specific area."
"I am convinced that this type of energy production will create jobs in rural areas and thus help implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"Is the Council Presidency in possession of approximate estimates as to how many new jobs this will create in rural areas?"
"."
"If I may start, Mrs Schierhuber, with your first question, on the subject of certification and labelling, we are, in creating a new energy policy for Europe, right at the beginning, not only in Europe, but also around the world."
"It will be for us to take care, by implementing certification systems, to ensure sustainable alternative energy supplies from other parts of the world, since all the things to which you have referred – the deforestation of the rain forest and the production of palm oil subject to social and environmental criteria – are things we see as undesirable."
"A number of approaches are being adopted; in Austria, for example, we have defined cross-compliance conditions derived from agricultural reform as the basis for energy production and also for the admixture of biodiesel and bioethanol, the consequence of which is that anything produced subject to eco-social criteria and production conditions, and to European standards, can be added irrespective of which parts of the world it comes from."
"Over the coming weeks, the issue will be surfacing in the WTO, too, of how certification and legal bases be implemented in such a way that they meet the requirements of international trade and the WTO, and this is where detailed scrutiny is going to be needed; indeed, Commissioner Piebalgs is being no less energetic than the EU officials and those at national level with responsibility for this, in seeking clarity in this matter in order not to settle this issue as prematurely as some others have been, only for us then to suffer defeats on the legal front and thus lose the market."
"Certification and labelling are core issues."
"As regards your second question on research, development and the research framework programme, a greater emphasis will be placed on alternative energy in the infrastructure as a whole as part of the innovation and research strategy, from the extraction of the raw materials right through to production and use made of it in technology."
"As is also envisaged in the sphere of research and development, we will apply a great deal more effort to moving this forward."
"If I may turn to the jobs issue, what, according to the estimates, is going to happen if greater reliance is placed on alternative forms of energy? As my own country’s minister for agriculture and the environment, I enjoy the strategic advantage of being in an absolute win-win situation, in that the use of alternative sources of energy not only has the effect of bringing about a reduction in CO2, and thereby making a substantial contribution to achieving the Kyoto targets, but also makes full use of the resources in rural areas – particularly the more isolated ones in Europe – and creates jobs in them."
"An extra 30 000 jobs – that is the figure indicated by studies carried out by the European Union and other bodies, if we are consistent in proceeding with the achievement of alternative energy targets."
"– The European biofuel strategy lays down objectives for the European Union and obligations incumbent upon the Member States."
"However, there are serious discrepancies between the Member States in terms of technological progress, market size, scale of production and fuel market structures."
"I should therefore like to ask the Council if this policy perhaps needs to be re-examined."
"Perhaps the introduction of obligations runs counter to current economic and technological circumstances?"
"You are talking about something that is true not only of European energy policy, but also of the ways in which the nation states perceive European targets and achieve them."
"All I can say is that we can see from the optional 5.75% target for biofuels that more and more countries are now joining in."
"Austria has achieved this target by means of binding legislation; the Hungarians are very definitely interested, and in Germany, too, this target is already the subject of legislation that is going through the system."
"A lot is being done, then, and I am very optimistic about the likelihood of the Member States consistently achieving the targets we have set down both in the biofuels strategy plan and in the plan for biomass."
"I will concede, though, that this is often not just a matter of political will, but also of the way in which trends in fossil fuel prices are consistently confirming that we are going down the right road."
"In discussions with our counterparts, we always reiterate the point that strategies must not only be devised at European level, but also implemented by the nation states."
"Some are going on ahead, while others are lagging behind, but, at the end of the day, we are all going in the right direction."
"I am very optimistic."
"Biomass is a most important form of energy, accounting for 65% of the renewable energy used in the EU."
"However, the total percentage of renewable energy used in the EU has remained at 6% since 1990."
"Therefore, does the Austrian Presidency agree that any realistic common energy policy should include the use of nuclear power?"
"I can do no other than agree with you that the push for renewable energy sources is certainly not a matter for energy policy alone; it must be supported by a policy on the supply of raw materials – that is to say, agricultural and forestry policy, biomass, and agricultural production – and by action in the spheres of environmental, economic and fiscal policy."
"It has to be clear to us that what we need for input, for incentives to produce, is more stringently binding agricultural targets."
"In addition, the Commission's proposal will be up for debate at the end of the year, and that is a very good thing."
"We are evaluating where we stand and what we have the potential to do."
"We will, in June – before, that is, our presidency draws to a close – be embarking on the debate on a forestry strategy for Europe and on the assessment of ways in which forests might be used in the future, and economic and fiscal policies at national level must also make allowances for renewable energies, whether we are talking here about green power, support for heating, support in terms of equipment and infrastructure or research and development."
"This is a task for all of us together, but an enormous amount is happening on this front."
"– It is well known that it is at present somewhat more expensive to produce biofuels than to use fossil fuels, and it was for that reason the alternative fuels were given favourable tax treatment, the consequence being that annual increases of some 26% are to be reckoned with."
"Will the mandatory blending that the Commission is launching not have the result that the oil industry will have increasing recourse to suppliers of cheap crude oil such as Brazil and hence put our European farmers at an even greater disadvantage in the future?"
". I do not see it like that."
"Giving the answers is a matter for the European Union and for all of us."
"I tried earlier to show how the issue of certification might be handled."
"What we in Austria did about implementation was to make a mixture of 5.75% mandatory, and we will achieve that in October 2008."
"We are a very, very long way down the road towards doing that."
"Facilities for producing biodiesel and ethanol are being set up, and jobs created with them; in my own province alone, a new factory for ethanol is currently creating work for 180 people."
"That is what we have done, and we take responsibility for it."
"We have also made it quite clear in the specifications that the products mixed must be produced in accordance with European social, environmental and agricultural standards."
"If it is possible for that sort of product to be manufactured in Brazil, then Brazil is in competition with us, but even if Brazil is in a position to do that, the long distance that the products have to be transported is one of the factors that blunt its competitive edge."
"We are, then, in a position to respond to this, and we can do it by means of certification and by means of decisive action on the market, which we must evaluate and defend at WTO level."
"What we do not want is to establish sustainable energy policy in Europe and then end up doing something like importing the products."
"Our ten new Member States – to whose number Romania and Bulgaria are soon to be added – give us incredible potential, with a very large number of plots of land capable of being set aside for the production of energy rather than of foodstuffs, and the agricultural specifications have been chosen in such a way as to make this possible."
"Question No 8 by Earn Ryan has been withdrawn."
"The Commission proposal for the Euro 5 regulation on pollutant emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles is not very ambitious, particularly as regards the limit values for nitrogen oxides for diesel cars."
"What action has the Council taken on this issue, and what progress has been made during the Austrian Presidency?"
". The Austrian Presidency has already seen several debates on the quite crucial issue of how to minimise and limit the pollutants produced by vehicles in transit."
"We started negotiations on the Commission’s proposal with the aim of putting in place progressive rules, with a longer-term perspective, on exhaust gases, and with the intention that these rules would – crucially in terms of our discussions today on sustainability – not only satisfy the demands of environmental policy but also give European industry the security to plan its technical development in advance."
"Both of these things can be achieved through stringent imposition, in the medium term, of threshold values for emissions from – for example – diesel vehicles."
"It was with this in mind that negotiations were conducted at Council level, in the hope of achieving, in June 2006 – which is almost upon us – political agreement in the Council, on the assumption that such a thing would be possible in terms of the timetable, particularly in so far as it related to Parliament."
"If I might give a brief summary, it emerged from the negotiations – which, in accordance with the Austrian Presidency’s initiative, were accompanied by two specific information seminars for the Member States, the first, in February, discussing mainly the state-of-the-art environmental requirements for removing particulates from vehicle exhausts, in particular NOx from the exhausts of diesel cars, while a second is to be held on 22 June – that a broad majority among the Member States have expressed themselves in favour of this objective, concerning which there are already to be definite and binding discussions in relation to the stipulation of Euro-6 limits."
"We will, of course, be consistent in moving this issue forward."
"It is absolutely vital that both air strategy and the implementation of Euro-5 and Euro-6 be discussed at the next Environment Council at the end of June."
"We want to take an ambitious approach to these things."
"In view of the discussion on the PM10 issue, on particulates pollution, particularly in Central Europe, and on NOx values, it is important that unambiguous rules be put in place, for it must be clear to us that what our industry needs is the security to plan ahead, and that it is, worldwide, in competition with other vehicle manufacturers, some of whom have already ventured some very ambitious responses."
"As these matters progress, we want to move forwards for the sake of environmental safety and quality of life in Europe and also for the sake of the health of the people who live in the areas affected."
"We will, then, endeavour to maintain this tricky balance between Euro-5 and Euro-6 as perspectives, as well, possibly, as Nx and PM10 as means of achieving environment targets, and, on the other hand, the desire to keep Europe’s automobile industry competitive."
"This is the path down which we have set out, and, at the Environment Council, we will have to discuss these two issues – air strategy and Euro-5, and also the further prospects for them – in very considerable depth, and several Commissioners will be present when we do so."
"– First, let me say how very grateful I am for the precision of your answers, which is a breath of fresh air."
"I would also like to know what you mean, in this planning, by the terms ‘progressive’ and ‘long term’, and whether you have other intentions in mind as regards heavy utility vehicles."
". I can, today, give only a report on the general mood as regards the specific requirements."
"The main thing that came out of the Council’s general debate was that the environment ministers unanimously welcomed the proposal for a drastic reduction in the particulate limit values for private diesel vehicles to 5mg per kilometre, whilst the Commission’s 20% reduction in NOx limit values was regarded as inadequate."
"Such is the present state of the debate, which we will continue in June."
"A broad majority of the Member States has already expressed itself in favour of a second stage of reduction in NOx for Euro 6, that is to say, of taking a more ambitious approach to NOx reduction – which we see as having gone a very long way as regards particulate threshold values – along with a vision for even now guaranteeing industry the security to plan ahead even beyond Euro 5, which means, then, not adopting Euro 5 right now, irrespective of the details of the limit values, and then embarking on the next debate in two or three years’ time."
"Over and above that, we must give industry a signal as to how things are to go in the future, and I see that – which is the approach we want to take – as a sensible thing to do."
"– Euro 5 is a big step in the right direction."
"We also need to see how many percent by way of a reduction we can manage with and over what period of time."
"Does anyone, at this early stage, have any idea about the timetable and the transitional periods?"
"As regards the timetable and the transitional periods, it is probably too early to give any indications concerning these, although I am involved in dialogue with most of the Member States."
"The problem we had in the last general debate was that we were guided by the Commission’s specifications and used them as the basis for the evaluation, but we have not yet got to the point at which I can sum up for you the sense of the meeting as regards the percentage reductions and the periods of time over which they are being contemplated."
"It is, however, my intention, over a period of years – over a decade, indeed – to sketch out a vision and to set out the approximate stages by which these things may be implemented in practice, while setting out even now the further steps whereby we are contemplating the implementing stage of Euro 6."
"The clear message, then, is that, rather than wanting to complete Euro 5 with a mere compromise and then promptly starting again with something new, we want, over and above that, to put down an unmistakeable marker."
"Can the European Council make a statement as to how much financial support the EU will be giving to support forestry programmes in Europe, in general, and to Ireland, in particular, for the financial period 2007-2013?"
"."
"On the subject of European forestry, we want, in June – that is, before the end of the Austrian Presidency – to put down a marker by opening a debate on the question of a forestry strategy for Europe, a subject on which we have as yet had no joint debates, but one that has now become all the more important to us since the decision on the promotion of rural development through the European Fund for Agriculture and Rural Development is making it possible for the Member States, between 2007 and 2013, to implement a development programme for rural areas that incorporates the protection of woodlands."
"The intention is – and this is important – that this forestry measure should in particular enhance the competitiveness of forestry – as stated in Article 20 – and promote the management of wooded land."
"I would remind the House that the funds made available for this purpose at national level will be – as specified in EU Regulation 1698/2005 – co-funded by the Community and the Member States."
"The Community’s contribution towards the forestry strategy and support for forestry will amount to between something like 50% and 55%, with upper limits clearly set out in the annex to the regulation."
"The total amount of aid to be granted for forestry programmes in Ireland for example in the 2007-2013 period, is being planned by the responsible authorities, who will submit to the European Union their plans for the allocation of national resources and for cofinancing by the European Union, for which provision has been made in legislation on rural development."
"I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I want to ask him whether he believes that by-products of the European forestry industry have a potentially important role to play in the future in providing renewable energy sources."
". I regard that scenario as absolutely necessary."
"We must not, in Europe, make a mistake of the kind that we have sometimes made at national level, for example in energy policy, by discussing ambitious goals to the exclusion of all else. How big should renewable energy’s slice of the energy cake be?"
"What we really need is an evaluation of potential. What long-term potential is there in Europe for the production of renewable energy from biomass, wood, biogas, wind energy or water?"
"What is the workable potential when account is taken of sustainability, and by what means do we want to inject funds into rural development in order to make use of this potential on the energy supply market in ways that make good, effective and cost-efficient use of resources?"
"That is what the forestry strategy, on which we are now embarking, and the biomass action plan, which is already underway, are intended to enable us to discuss."
"The Finnish Presidency of the Council will be making the forestry strategy one of its core priorities, and now, in June, we are playing the overture to it."
"There must be greater emphasis on resources in debates, not least in those on rural development, as we, indeed, are doing in Austria, where, since 47% of our land surface is wooded, we will, in future, be prioritising the sustainable supply of biomass as a raw material, using, funds for rural development and a programme specifically for that purpose."
"Bearing in mind Articles 2 and 6 of the EC Treaty, which stipulate that environmental protection is to be considered a horizontal objective, Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003(1) concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community, the Commission communication on a forestry strategy for the European Union (COM(1998)0649 final) and the European Parliament's resolutions on natural disasters regional aspects (2005/2193(INI)), environmental aspects (2005/2192(INI)) and agricultural aspects (2005/2195(INI)), and given that, according to United Nations figures, natural disasters in the European Union have claimed the lives of 65 000 people since 1980 and have had an economic cost amounting to EUR 124 200 million, what action has the Austrian Presidency taken to safeguard the sustainability of European forests?"
"The Community measures for the promotion of sustainable forest management in the European Union form part of the EU’s forestry strategy, which comprises several components, namely rural development, the protection and monitoring of forests, the maintenance of biodiversity and the alleviation of the effects of climate change."
"Woodland performs a very wide variety of functions, and rural development policy is – as I said in response to the previous question – the main instrument for implementing the forestry strategy at Community level."
"Under the heading of rural development over the period from 2000 to 2006, the Community made available funds to a total of some EUR 4.8 billion for forestry in Europe, amounting to 10% of the total funding allocated to rural development."
"Over and above that, the new regulation provides for even more to be done for forestry as part of the promotion of rural development between 2007 and 2013."
"This amounts to a forthright commitment to forestry and both to producers and consumers in the forestry field."
"What are the future areas for support in forestry to which we refer?"
"One, for a start, is first afforestation on agricultural land, the initial setting up of agricultural forestry systems on farmland, the initial afforestation on non-agricultural land, payments under Natura 2000, forest-environment payments, the restoration of forestry potential, the introduction of prevention actions, and also support for non-productive investments."
"What will be important in determining the direction we take in the future is the fact that we must not, in the debate on the forest strategy, forget one thing, namely that forests have a task to perform in terms of the biodiversity of flora and fauna, that they provide space for relaxation, that they have an environmental role to play, that they help us to deal with climate change, that they prepare the ground for sustainable energy supply, while at the same time having an enormous part to play in Europe’s economy."
"It is vitally important that this be considered as a whole, and the forest strategy also needs to include extensive discussion of these issues."
"– Of course I am satisfied with your answer."
"Nevertheless, given the environmental protection responsibility and Parliament's resolutions on natural disasters and the regional, environmental and agricultural scale thereof, describing in detail the tragedy most keenly felt in Mediterranean Europe, especially last year in Spain and in my country Portugal, which were attributable to the continued destruction of vast forest areas, and which led to a heavy cost in terms of human sustainability, of the depopulation of rural areas, of the growth and development of these areas, I should like to ask you, Mr Pröll, if there are any more …"
"."
"The honourable Member’s question specifically relates to a region in which forestry has historically been beset by problems, particularly with forest fires and all the other things that are matters of concern around the Mediterranean, and it is clear that the forestry strategy can be not only a strategy for the European countries with productive forests and a great deal of land covered by them, but also that we must, at the same time, take into account the problematic aspects that he has mentioned."
"I therefore take it as read that very serious attention will be given, under the Finnish Presidency and its successors, to the issues of afforestation, environmental action and fire prevention, among others, in the countries and regions to which you, Mr Fernandes, have referred."
"We also have to devise appropriate action for the most disadvantaged regions, and it matters to me that we should do so."
"The forestry strategy is planned to be not only for such countries as Sweden, Finland and Austria, but is also to take account of all circumstances throughout the European Union."
"– Further to your reference to Natura 2000 as one of the possible sources for afforestation strategies, the problem we have had with this, over and over again, is that a very large number of landowners ended up with obligations, and some of them had no help whatever with discharging them. Does the programme or the Financial Perspective make provision for financial facilities to meet this?"
"."
"That, Mr Rack, is a matter that is not so much of direct relevance to the European Union as to the manner of implementation at nation state level, but it is important, in the forest strategy, Natura 2000, and all other measures that have an effect on property – which protective measures for animals and plants certainly do – that local landowners be involved in their design and practical implementation."
"That is a task for those who have to put Natura 2000 into practice."
"Lack of experience has meant that many mistakes have been made, and Natura 2000 in the broadest sense of the term has for that reason often got a bad name for itself, but, in those regions and countries in which it has been implemented well, not only with dialogue with landowners in devising the management plans but also with an appropriate range of direct payments on offer, the system has been effective."
"One can point to a number of exemplary instances of this, but what is necessary is that the landowners be involved in the development of strategy and of management plans, and there must then be no doubt about what is on offer: if the environment is to be used, then, in the forest, appropriate compensation must be made for that."
"Since 2001, the severe foaming of the water in the River Rába, which flows across the Austro-Hungarian border, caused by naphthaline sulphonate pollution, has been causing serious problems."
"The source of the pollution is discharges of waste water in excess of limit values by the Austrian firm Boxmark at Jennersdorf and Feldbach and by the firm Schmidt at Wollsdorf."
"These operations, which have been going on for five years, damaging the natural environment and local residents, have resulted in recurrent protests from Hungary (Austro-Hungarian Border Waters Committee, joint government meeting, representatives of civil society, etc.)."
"In five years, nothing has happened;"
"Austria's Environmental Protection Minister has requested 'patience'."
"How will Austria, in its capacity as holder of the Presidency of the Union, set an example for other Member States?"
"How will it comply with its legal obligations relating to the quality of surface waters and with the Helsinki Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes?"
". The question that I am trying to answer in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council is not only a very specific one, but also one that I am, in particular, bound to answer as a national minister."
"By adopting Directive 2060/EC, Parliament and the Council agreed on a comprehensive regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy; the directive has, , the objective of progressively reducing the introduction of hazardous substances into water."
"It provides for cooperation between the Member States in respect of cross-border water courses, an area in which the Commission can, where necessary, act as a mediator."
"Turning to the specific question you put to me concerning the Raab, I can only report that foaming does occur along the river mainly on an occasional basis, that it is very much restricted to the local area, and, in particular, occurs downstream of protective overflows."
"There has to date been no evidence of this foaming having any detrimental effect on the Raab’s water system, yet, nevertheless, Austria, not least as a result of the efforts of my experts, in its report analysing the pollution and its effects in accordance with Article 5 of the Water Framework Directive creating a regulatory framework for Community measures in the sphere of water policy, described the chemical state of the affected stretch of the Raab as being associated with the risk of failing to achieve a good standard of water."
"In accordance with the rules contained in the EU Water Framework Directive, further samples are being taken with the aim of determining the causes and the extent of, and possible solutions, to the problem, in order to put the programme of measures on a secure footing."
"Speaking from where I am, I can assure you that I have the utmost interest in finding, in an ordered and positive relationship with our Hungarian neighbour, a solution to that which is provided for in the common European water policy plan, and will do everything in my power, in consultation with the officials responsible in the regions, specifically in two Austrian federal provinces, to get the problem taken seriously and progress made towards a solution that benefits Hungary as well."
"I have an absolute interest in that; I will ensure that it comes to pass, and, in Austria, I have already taken appropriate action to that end."
"Mr President, Minister, I would like to thank you and the Austrian Government for what you have done, and for your promise that starting from 1 July, the polluted water from the Jennersdorf leather factory will no longer be discharged into the river Raab."
"I think we agree that the Austrian-Hungarian border, as a green belt of a certain kind, should become a citadel of ecotourism."
"Therefore I would like to ask you whether we may also be able to resolve the problem of the geothermal project at Fürstenfeld, which pollutes the river Lapincs (Lafnitz) via the river Feistritz."
". In both instances, and especially in the case of the Raab, to which you refer, we have set up bilateral commissions in order, together, to ensure that your objections are addressed, so that you, by naming a date and a specific factory will ensure that improvements are made, and I have also approached the appropriate regional authorities directly."
"I have a great deal of interest in this and will see to it that we succeed in both cases, since I, as the Minister for the Environment of the Republic of Austria, have an equal interest in being heard in your proceedings, for example in respect of the nuclear power station at Pacs."
"Being neighbours, we have shared interests in the region; there is give and take, and I trust that that will be the case as regards water just as much as it is already in matters relating to atomic power."
"– Since Austria is, of course, well known for clean lakes and clean rivers, I would be interested to know how the European rules compare with the Austrian ones."
"Is it at EU level or in Austria that the inspections are more rigorous?"
"."
"When compared with that in other countries, the quality of Austrian water is very good."
"Problems do occur from time to time – there is no doubt about that – and we must, together with Hungary, work towards finding solutions to them, but, taken as a whole, water in Austria is of outstanding quality, as can be measured against the standards laid down by the European Union’s Bathing Water Directive."
"It was at one of the first debates that I, as a young minister, was allowed to attend, at the first Council of Environment Ministers in March 2003, that we first discussed the Bathing Water Directive in which these standards are laid down, and so I am able to tell your House today that we have been able to make constant improvements in the quality of running water, and that the water in all Austrian lakes is fit to bathe in and, in most, even fit to drink."
"That cost us billions of euros in terms of investment in purification plant, but it is nonetheless important."
"It is in the same spirit that brought us that development that we want to join with Hungary in working to resolve the problem on the Raab."
"The Mediterranean constitutes the most important tourist destination in the world, while its natural resources are the object of various activities of great economic and social significance for all the Member States of the Union and for countries in the region."
"Each year, as studies carried out by the European Environment Agency record, the continuing pollution of the environment, principally caused by urban and industrial waste together with shipping operations, has resulted, inter alia, in contempt for these natural resources and the ecologically unsustainable management of fish stocks."
"In addition to fostering regional cooperation through the UN Environment Programme's 'Mediterranean Action Plan’, what measures does the Council propose to take to promote the effective implementation of Community legislation in the Member States of the Union and the implementation of the Community acquis on protection of the environment and waters in the Mediterranean States?"
"Does the Council agree with the inclusion of binding provisions and measures in the partnership agreements with the countries of the Mediterranean and in the Barcelona Process?"
". As was firmly reiterated in the Council’s annual presentation to the March 2005 Spring Summit, the Council is prioritising, among other things, the practical ways in which the European Community applies environmental law and the requirement for further improvements in European policymaking with balanced consideration of the economic, social and environmental factors involved."
"The EU-Mediterranean ministerial conferences regularly consider the complex issues around the environmental sustainability of the Mediterranean area, and – as part of the implementation of the outcomes of the two EU-Mediterranean ministerial conferences on environmental issues held in Helsinki in November 1997 and in Athens in July 2002 – efforts are being focussed on the laying down of a strategic framework and the promotion of a common approach and joint initiatives towards improving institutional and technical capacities in the region."
"The primary intention in doing this is that greater attention be given to synergies with other programmes than has been the case in the past."
"The Seventh Foreign Affairs Ministers’ Conference on 30 and 31 May 2005 in Luxembourg once again confirmed the Commission’s initiative to remove pollution from the Mediterranean by 2020, the object of which initiative was to address all sources of pollution including industrial emissions, municipal waste and urban waste water, in order to improve the development prospects for tourism, increase the fisheries stocks, and make safe drinking water available to millions of members of the public in these regions, and the Mediterranean partners were to be supported in this by the provision of appropriate funding."
"The objectives I have enumerated were confirmed at the EU-Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona."
"Demands were also made for the drawing up of a timetable for the removal of pollution from the Mediterranean by 2020, and for consideration to be given to comparable experiences with sustainable development already gained from the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea regions."
"Five action plans have been negotiated and formally adopted under the European Neighbourhood Policy, these being with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and the Palestinian Authority."
"Negotiations on similar plans are underway with Egypt and the Lebanon, with a particular and urgent interest in environmental protection and the supply of water, but also in the disposal of waste water and the EU’s experience with environmental impact assessments and the work of the European Environment Agency."
"It has, in any case, been our intention that deeper bilateral cooperation should include the implementation of multilateral environment agreements on the protection of the Mediterranean."
"– Mr President, Minister, thank you for your reply."
"As you said, the Mediterranean is the most important tourist destination and maritime environmental policy is therefore extremely important."
"Does the Council therefore intend to use the procedures you mentioned, such as partnership agreements and the Barcelona process, to promote something along the same lines as the maritime strategy framework already being promoted in the European Union under the relevant directive?"
"The reason I ask is because we already have a strategy in the directive in question."
"Do we therefore also intend to promote this strategy through our partnerships in the Mediterranean?"
"I believe that this would make maritime environmental protection much more effective."
". I very definitely take the view that the partnership agreement requires of us greater input as regards what form the financial resources should take."
"Mechanisms were already in place in the past in order to support the Mediterranean region as a whole in performing its highly diverse and necessary functions and in meeting the demands of its peculiarities and vulnerabilities, not least in its ecosystems."
"The Council will indeed have to give greater consideration to the issue of direct support."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"– The next item is the report by Paolo Costa (A6-0194/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security (COM(2005)0429 – C6-0290/2005 – 2005/0191(COD))."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a piece of draft legislation that the Commission and the European Parliament regard as an important initiative."
"The proposal adopted by the Commission on 22 September 2005 is important because the fight on all fronts against the terrorist threat remains a priority and because we need to learn the right lessons from the implementation of current legislation."
"We must continue to seek ways of improving the protection of the European public and of reconciling security requirements more effectively with the operational needs of all stakeholders, be they public authorities, airports or airlines."
"The legislation in force establishes rules for the security of civil aviation."
"It was drafted with the utmost urgency in the wake of the terrorist atrocities of 11 September 2001."
"The aim of the present draft is to consolidate that legislation on the basis of subsequent experience."
"The rules in force are fairly detailed, as becomes plain whenever we try to introduce any new technology or to make the system more flexible in order to deal with specific risks."
"A need for simplification has become apparent in the light of experience."
"Without prejudice to the subsidiarity principle, the Commission believes that harmonisation of security requirements in the European Union is indispensable, and it is in the interests of European civil aviation that this harmonisation should be enhanced."
"We must meet that expectation."
"Experience gained through the inspections conducted by the Commission has shown that some provisions of the Regulation require further clarification."
"The Commission has proposed a rebalancing of the channels through which its implementing powers are exercised within the context of the comitology procedure so that it can respond more rapidly to technological change and increase the confidentiality of rules that must remain outside the public domain."
"I am convinced that, if this revised draft on aviation security is adopted, it will not only afford the public better protection but will also establish a consolidated framework that strikes a good balance between the extension of controls to counteract specific risks and the minimisation of their operational impact, giving due consideration to the interests of all parties."
"I note with satisfaction that the draft report presented to us today reproduces the line of argument underlying the Commission’s initiative as well as addressing the specific operational requirements that have become apparent."
"Mr Costa has produced a very valuable piece of work, and I wish to thank him for the quality of his report and for the cooperative spirit that was evident in his dealings with the Commission."
"Knowing the Commission’s proposal, the balance of opinion within the Council and the amendments proposed by the European Parliament to the most technical part of the proposal, I am very hopeful, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that an agreement can materialise quickly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we can try this evening to make progress with this regulation and its subject-matter, which will enable us to conclude a piece of legislation initiated in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks."
"It is quite right that all the consequences of that experience should be examined and that we should be even better prepared to tackle the situation now developing."
"I should just like to highlight two aspects of the work we have done, because the Commission’s proposal is an excellent one that just needed to be made more explicit on a few points and developed further on a single point."
"The proposal needed to be made more explicit regarding the idea that we can only be certain of achieving a good outcome for aviation security if we have a single system that provides a level of security guaranteed by every airport and every airline."
"The system as a whole has been redefined precisely to that effect."
"The idea of implementing a single security system is essential if we are to provide the strongest possible protection for all European and non-European citizens who fly in our skies and use our airports."
"I believe there is one point that has been neglected ever since 2002, which is the fact that, if at least a basic level of common security is to be imposed throughout Europe, effective funding mechanisms also need to be provided."
"Support for such funding may come from two sources: one resulting from the general public concern that we must defend ourselves against possible terrorist attacks, and the other resulting from individual fear, in that each passenger as such produces a demand for additional security."
"Currently, the situation in Europe as regards the way these measures are funded is extremely varied and not necessarily very fair or correct."
"That is the reason why we have insisted – and continue to insist – on the need to lay down rules for funding these basic security measures, keeping in mind the possibility of redistributing the funding equally between the two sources. That is the subject of the amendment that we have put forward, which was supported by a large majority in committee and I hope will likewise be accepted in this House tomorrow."
"With our amendment, therefore, we invite the Commission to make some technical suggestions on the subject."
"The European Parliament will, for its part, do everything possible for the amendment to be accepted."
"I am aware of the fact that this is a sensitive subject for the Council, but I believe that, if security is indeed regarded as a supreme good and a primary objective, it is essential to create the right conditions to guarantee it."
"Precisely because the security funding situation in Europe is highly varied at the moment, it is important to ensure that the issue is made explicit, that the citizens understand what they are contributing towards, and that the funds intended for security be used transparently and effectively."
"In drawing up the common rule, we have also had to address matters of detail that are very much in the public eye, such as the problem of on-board security. In that regard, Parliament suggests imposing a ban on having weapons on board, except in special, duly authorised cases."
"I consider this an acceptable solution, and I hope that tomorrow Parliament will effectively help to make the report and the regulation progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted at the proposal for a regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"If it is adopted, we can hope for greater cooperation within the Union, so that we can live in a more secure Europe."
"I endorse the idea of a single security system, the aim of which is to make further checks unnecessary if the Member States are reasonably sure that the basic security rules have been followed at the airport of origin."
"I am not overjoyed, however, that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am the draftsman, and which was actually adopted by a very large majority, has not been taken into due consideration."
"I believe, in fact, that the Member States should keep the power to apply more stringent security measures both internally and in the context of bilateral relations with third countries, should they consider them necessary on the basis of legitimate risk assessments."
"Such more stringent measures should in all cases be proportionate and in keeping with civil liberties and free market principles, as in fact is pointed out in the opinion that I have drafted."
"While I believe that the Commission should confine itself to laying down minimum standards and carrying out checks by means of regular as well as unannounced inspections, I consider it excessive that the Commission should be able to decide by itself whether a State can continue to apply more stringent measures or not."
"In addition, I am consoled by the fact that, at least in the area of on-board measures, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has seen fit to take up my amendment extending the definition of ‘potentially disruptive passengers’ to people whose behaviour is a source of genuine concern."
"I am very pleased at the acceptance of my amendment calling on the Commission to draw up an annual report on the application of national security programmes."
"In short, I felt that the proposal needed to be accepted, including by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as it aims at making the various programmes the subject of an annual report by the Commission to the European Parliament and the national parliaments, informing them of the application of the national security programmes as well as the results achieved by the new regulation."
"."
"Mr President, since the start of this Parliament I have worked on several reports dealing with security issues in the transport sector."
"I notice that on each occasion we seem to have exactly the same debates, whether the report deals with seaports or, as in this case, airports and aviation."
"Different industries face different threats necessitating different security measures."
"However, the report in front of us today is one that will probably have the greatest impact on the safety of Europe’s citizens."
"In general I welcome this proposal."
"Clear rules for security across Europe’s airports are absolutely necessary."
"However – and here I speak personally – I have some concerns about some of the measures."
"Firstly, within the proposals before us, the Commission attempts to accrue more power for itself."
"What I refer to is the issue of special security measures."
"Those generally short-term increases in security, based on national intelligence, should not have to be approved by the Commission before being implemented."
"The Commission does not have the facility of intelligence-sharing, nor should it have, in my opinion."
"Therefore it does not have the ability to carry out that task effectively."
"In some cases that particular position could jeopardise security itself."
"It is for Member States to decide on what extra measures they deem necessary."
"The Commission’s role should be to coordinate, not to dictate."
"The issue of in-flight security does not belong in this regulation."
"Again, those are measures for individual governments and their own air carriers."
"My greatest concern is the proposal contained in some of the amendments adopted in committee to extend the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency to take on security."
"When the EASA was originally set up, it was generally agreed that it would deal with safety issues and have no influence on security."
"I remember well the problems caused in some languages by that definition."
"Since then the EASA has not proved itself competent, even in this area of work."
"I do not see why, given that failing, extra powers should be given to it."
"Despite these reservations I see the benefits of common security standards across the Union."
"With the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today, improvements in security must and should be encouraged."
"Thus, with the support of a number of colleagues, I have tabled some amendments that not only address my concerns but all of those across the industry."
"I hope we can achieve a workable solution to these issues."
"Common standards, not draconian regulation, are required for the continued safety for all Europe’s citizens."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa, and the other shadow rapporteurs for the excellent team effort."
"Apart from a few minor details, we can more or less agree on everything, or at least the gist, and we as Parliament will be able to put forward a forceful opinion."
"Since 11 September, safety is, of course, more than ever, an important topic, and it goes without saying that aviation requires our particular attention, given the potentially devastating effect of attacks involving aircraft."
"To my group, this means that we must always strive for the highest level of protection, but that this must be accompanied by a sufficient level of transparency and with respect for civil liberties."
"The protection efforts and related costs must be proportionate to the safety risks."
"In that light, the committee of experts which issues implementing decisions of this framework legislation should not simply be given to make any proposals without any opposition."
"That is why Amendment 61, which formally provides for the establishment of an Advisory Group for interested parties, is important."
"We feel that not only industry, but also other organisations should be able to sit on this group, including passenger associations and, possibly, organisations that can give advice about civil liberties."
"We also ask for an annual report to be drawn up about the application of this regulation."
"A second element on which we are agreed, and to which the rapporteur has already made reference, is that it should be clear who should cover the costs of security at airports."
"By extension, there should, of course, also be clarity about the distribution of the security costs in the entire transport sector."
"Is it the customers, industry, or perhaps the government?"
"It will, of course, need to be a combination of the three, but what is important is that we must seek to establish the same European rules wherever we go."
"We talked about this during a previous meeting, Commissioner."
"You are supposed to present an initiative by the summer, and we are awaiting this with anticipation."
"A major improvement in the Commission proposal is the fact that the chapter on safety on board civil aircraft has been added."
"It is about, amongst other things, the notorious sky marshals, armed security officials on board aircraft."
"We are, in principle, opposed to the presence of arms in aircraft because their misuse or accidents can have devastating consequences."
"As such, we are not fans of these measures."
"The problem is that the deployment of security officials is a matter for the Member States to decide, and that is also how it will be in future."
"Some countries, including France and the United Kingdom, have already used them, while others, such as Greece and Spain, have not."
"In that light, we welcome this additional measure as an opportunity for regulating this issue at least partly at European level by, for example, imposing uniform procedures and strict security regulations or by providing for cross-border training."
"We too have tabled two amendments."
"The first is a formal amendment with regard to Gibraltar Airport in order to bring the text into line with existing agreements."
"The second is an amendment in which we ask for a European system to be set up for the certification of equipment which is used for the protection of airports, including X-ray scanners and such like."
"This issue should be tackled at European level, not least because not all Member States have the expertise needed to make the right choices about the security equipment, which is becoming ever more modern."
"Moreover, the maze of standards is a handicap for European industry compared to the US industry."
"I should like to ask for your support in this connection too."
"."
"Mr President, whilst congratulating Mr Costa on his excellent report, I wish to bring to the attention of this House four areas of concern in relation to civil aviation security which, in my view, are not adequately dealt with by either the existing or the proposed legislation."
"The first relates to the non-inclusion in the proposal under consideration of improvements in the measures to prevent unauthorised access to the flight crew compartment."
"Such measures are currently covered only by ICAO provisions."
"These provisions are, unfortunately, outdated and need revision based on experience."
"Such experience is provided, for example, by the tragic crash of the Helios airline jet in Greece last summer in which 121 people died."
"On that occasion, the two pilots lost consciousness as a result of ensuing hypoxia and a steward, who was a qualified pilot himself, could not enter the cockpit in time to prevent a crash because of the currently-applied security locking system of the cockpit door."
"The second area of concern relates to the attempt to broaden the definition of a ‘potentially disruptive passenger’ to include people whose behaviour is potentially a source of dangerous disruption."
"This is welcomed, but unfortunately the most common type of disruptive passenger – the drunk passenger – is not dealt with here."
"Furthermore, there is no attempt to prevent such situations: alcohol continues to be served in plentiful quantities and, on many flights, free of charge to passengers."
"The most logical thing to do would be to ban alcohol use on flights."
"The third area of concern has to do with the security screening for potential weapons."
"Passengers are forbidden to carry objects which, only with the greatest stretch of the imagination, could possibly be considered to be of any offensive capability, such as nail clippers; yet glass bottles of alcoholic beverages, for example, are allowed on board."
"I need not point out that a broken bottle held by the bottle neck is a most dangerous weapon in the hands of an assailant."
"The wise approach would be not to allow glass bottles in the passenger cabin."
"The fourth area of concern is the controversial issue of flight marshals."
"The general approach of the legislators is that no weapon-carrying security officers should be present on aircraft."
"The main argument put forward in favour of this position is the alleged catastrophic risk of a weapon firing accidentally during flight."
"This is not accurate."
"Certain states such as Israel have for many years now had armed personnel on their national airline’s flights, and I am not aware of any such accidents occurring to date."
"In fact, modern weapons such as double action pistols with built-in advanced safety mechanisms cannot fire accidentally, but even if they did this is very unlikely to cause a crash."
"Indeed, there have been numerous occasions where firearms were used on board aircraft, and yet this in itself did not severely affect flight capability."
"On the other hand, the presence of air marshals could be crucial in neutralising a hijack situation and certainly could act as a strong deterrent in preventing one from arising in the first place."
". – Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating air safety for a long time, and quite rightly too; it is hardly surprising that it was necessary to update it in view, not only of what happened on 11 September 2001, but also of our experience of other terrorist acts on board aircraft."
"We had a major argument about how this was to be funded, that being crucial when it comes to making things safe, only then to ask oneself who is meant to come up with the necessary money."
"The whole committee, and all the Members of this House, would, however, have found it very helpful if we, at the very outset of the debate, had had sight of the Commission’s documents on a process reviewing the measures taken in response to 11 September 2001; that would certainly have made our discussions more straightforward and afforded us many more options."
"It does, nevertheless, make sense to take joint basic measures in matters of security."
"That is in any case more transparent than confrontation between different nations’ highly divergent ways of dealing with this, which may – and I deliberately say ‘may’, although many are probably aware of what I am talking about – be capable of being misused to distort competition or exclude certain practices."
"When it comes to the financial arrangements, there is a matter pertaining to the future that we have to address, and Mr El Khadroui has already mentioned it: we cannot stop at air transport in debating who is to take in hand security measures in connection with large-scale transport infrastructures."
"We also have to devise a financial measure that gives fair treatment to all means of transport in order not, from the very start, to give preferential treatment to certain of them in the funding of security measures or when it comes to the extent to which they are to be funded through the sale of tickets, by the taxpayer, by the airlines or by other bodies."
"This is where the European public have every right to expect transparency; that is a core requirement."
"Further to what Mr Matsakis had to say on the subject, I think the debate on the need to bar certain passengers is perfectly justified."
"Passengers under the influence of alcohol are one aspect of this, but the original effect of this proposal would have been to limit it to asylum seekers being sent home or to prisoners under escort."
"The extension of this term in the course of the debates in committee was urgently needed."
"Where sky marshals are concerned, I take a very firm line."
"I do not believe that the presence on board of armed personnel makes for greater security."
"The plain and simple fact is that there are circumstances under which that can mean that there is one weapon more available on board for terrorists or for those persons who plan or want to commit terrorist acts."
"Let me end, though, on a positive note: the idea of a users’ committee is a very important step in the right direction, and I hope that such committees will have a positive impact on the way measures are further developed."
"Mr President, harmonising protection regulations in civil aviation can increase the level of security."
"In this respect, we must ensure that there is sufficient democratic control over the decisions that are taken in the framework of comitology and that therefore largely remain outside of the public domain and out of Parliament’s control."
"As this involves sensitive and confidential information, it is understandable that people should wish to keep this out of the public domain, but it does make it all the more necessary for Parliament to be able to closely monitor the implementing measures that were agreed behind closed doors."
"As a consequence, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports Amendments 61 and 62 which provide for democratic supervision."
"We think it would be a good thing if the Advisory Group did not remain restricted to professional organisations, but was extended to include representatives of passenger interests organisations and of groups that campaign for the protection of civil liberties."
"Another aspect that caught our particular attention is the so-called sky marshals."
"In order to prevent arbitrariness and accidents in future, it is necessary to draw up common rules for deploying armed security officers on board aircraft."
"Along with other speakers, I doubt whether an armed presence on board would enhance security."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Costa, and to congratulate him on his work."
"Today we are dealing with an issue that is very important for public security, namely increasing protection measures – I repeat, protection measures – in the field of civil aviation."
"It is the next step towards a reduction in the threats, especially terrorist threats, associated with the use of civil aircraft to transport people and goods."
"We must admit that the 2002 regulation currently in force contains too many specific and formal solutions which make a flexible response to operational needs difficult."
"It is vital to retain an appropriate balance between the need for an effective and hence rapid response and an appropriate level of protection and control."
"Of course, it is also necessary to make the right decisions regarding the cost of the action required."
"It is a shame that the draft regulation does not cover this issue."
"I would be happy, Commissioner, to know at least an estimate of the necessary expenditure."
"It is good that the Member States are given the responsibility for drawing up appropriate plans for civil aviation security."
"Air carriers and operators are responsible for implementing programmes and technical conditions that ensure the right level of protection."
"Appropriate training for personnel is also required."
"We should also pay attention to the need for safety standards, and not lower them in an attempt to make savings."
"The next very important issue is to draw up appropriate agreements or contracts with countries outside the EU."
"It is therefore good that the regulation contains relevant provisions in Article 17 referring to that problem."
"I am glad to see that the annex to the regulation is clear and has a structure that permits, if necessary, the introduction of specific implementation guidelines."
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to draw your attention to the necessity of using measures and methods which will not be unnecessarily onerous or even humiliating for passengers."
"This applies to disabled passengers or parents with small children."
"Strange situations also occur, for example when a passenger has a very small nail file confiscated and shortly after, on board, if she is travelling business class, is given a metal knife and fork."
"Finally, I would like to state my conviction that the draft regulation presented by the Commission will be improved thanks to the approval of a series of very rational amendments, something I support on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"Perhaps you know what one mother is supposed to have said to her pilot son: ‘Only fly slowly and low’."
"I would put it differently: ‘Let us fly fast and as high as is necessary, but let us always fly safely’."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, some of what my esteemed colleague Mr Bradbourn had to say was his personal view;"
"I can assure the House and the Commissioner that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is – with the exception of one amendment – right behind the Costa report, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee and to the rapporteur for their very constructive cooperation."
"I just want to say something about two peculiarities in this House’s amendments."
"The first is that I believe that the costs of all security measures at airports should be split between those who use the airports and the Member States, for the measures put in place at airports are not primarily for the benefit of the individual passenger, but serve to avert dangers to all and sundry; that, traditionally, is one of the functions of the state, and it is the state that should pay for it to be done."
"By way of comparison – and on this evening it might well be an appropriate one – let me point out that my own country, when football matches are being staged, has hundreds of police officers on duty before, during and after the match, and not one spectator is required to pay even a cent for them."
"If, then, the cost of protecting people against danger at football matches is borne generally, then the same ought, even if only to some degree, to apply at airports."
"Secondly, we must make sure, once and for all, that the system of a single security check is brought in on flights not only within the European Union, but also between the European Union and secure third countries."
"It is surely not acceptable that someone should arrive at Frankfurt airport by air from Israel and be subject to a second security check before he travels on to Hamburg, and the same is true in the case of the USA."
"It must be possible for people arriving from a safe country to avoid going through additional security checks when they change flights within an EU Member State."
"This would be a sensible arrangement, and I hope that we, together with the Commission and the Council, will adopt it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Costa for a constructive report."
"I welcome the fact that plenary is now revising the existing regulation adopted directly after the terrorist attack on New York on 11 September 2001."
"I am deputising for Mrs Hedkvist Petersen in the committee."
"I was shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, where I tabled the amendments that were adopted by the committee and that are to be voted on tomorrow. These are about the distinction between postal mail and traditional cargo and about protection against terrorist attacks."
"We need increased security but also a balance between freedoms and rights."
"To have their post distributed efficiently and within a reasonable period of time is an important right for all EU citizens, especially for those who live in sparsely populated areas or outside cities and population centres."
"Quite a few Member States have airmail services, which are not at the same kind of risk as other forms of aviation."
"The period within which mail is distributed should not be several days, a state of affairs of which Europeans would take a very dim view."
"The amendments concerning mail and postal services guarantee that people will not receive a worse postal service because of the regulation."
"I also wish to comment on Amendment 22 concerning passengers who are potentially disruptive or whose behaviour is manifestly abnormal."
"It is important to make it clear that we are not referring to people with physical or mental disabilities."
"The fact is that, through ramps and other aids, we have made aviation accessible to everyone."
"This regulation must not make it inaccessible."
"It is also important to have clear and strict rules for when airlines have to have guards on board."
"The report strikes a clear balance between, on the one hand, the fight against the appalling terrorism that has hit aviation and against which we want to protect ourselves and, on the other hand, safe and efficient aviation and postal and cargo services."
"I applaud the report."
"– Mr President, it is now obvious that the measures being taken as part of the fight against terrorism are to a degree unavoidable."
"However, it is also clear that measures may become excessive and restrict the civil liberties of those they are supposed to protect."
"It is of paramount importance to have effective mechanisms which function as safety valves in order to avoid infringements of civil liberties."
"The letter of the law is important and must be controlled, but its application must be equally controlled."
"It is, however, worrying that more and more powers are being transferred to the centre of the Union, especially the Commission."
"Subsidiarity is being undermined slowly but surely."
"Another question which arises is how the information which is collected and disseminated will be managed and who will have access to it."
"All of this has been said before in connection with similar measures with similar objectives."
"We have our reservations, but we also recognise the Union's right to protect its citizens."
"Our differences therefore lie in the methods used."
"Mr President, there is a saying that you can never have too many security measures."
"In fact, this has become a commonly used truism."
"Is this really the case, however?"
"Is it true that the more security measures one has, the smaller the risks of exposing oneself to danger?"
"Of course, I ask these questions in the context of one issue, which even today is hotly debated, namely the possibility of special civil aviation security services that are authorised to carry weapons."
"I have no doubts that there should be a categorical and unequivocal ban in this particular case. This is not only because the use of these weapons, though obviously only in defence of passengers and crew, in itself poses a danger in the rather fragile environment of an airplane, but also for another reason, namely that weapons may provoke passengers who might otherwise have boarded the plane without any aggressive intentions."
"This is particularly the case if they are psychologically unstable."
"These kinds of passengers can after all also be found on board aircraft."
"It also seems unfortunate that neither Chapter 10(4) of the Annex or Amendment 79 addresses this matter."
"I repeat that I am in favour of a total ban on weapons on board aircraft."
"Someone may well ask ‘what about extraordinary situations where there is a suspected threat of danger’?"
"To this I would say that this flight should not be allowed to take off at all, and must be cancelled."
"I, for one, would certainly not want to be on that flight."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Costa on this report, which puts its finger on those aspects that were left out of the first Regulation, which, as a result of the horrendous 11 September attack, was put together by the various institutions with laudable speed and capacity to respond."
"It is the case, however, that, at that time, certain important aspects were left out of a negotiation which was carried out in response to what was a significant moment in terms of security."
"It is also the case that Mr Costa, in these proposed amendments to the Regulation presented by the Commission, which is now established as a framework Regulation while the contributions made by means of commitology and the application of experience are assessed, has improved – I believe – those aspects that were most necessary: those which introduce the concern and interests of the parties involved, both from the point of view of the Member States and from the point of view of the airlines and airports, and also the aspects which have not yet been dealt with in relation to funding and which are so dear to Mr Costa’s heart, who has made great progress in relation to them."
"We feel that there is a point in Mr Costa’s proposal, however, that, in his enthusiasm for improving this Regulation, has introduced some confusion: the package of clauses which relate to the application, which has been traditional and historical since 1987, of all of the legislation relating to safety in civil aviation applied to the Gibraltar airport."
"There is an amendment that we have presented from various perspectives which, without in any way jeopardising the safety applied to the Gibraltar airport, does preserve and protect the problem of an historical dispute, which is now on the point of being resolved."
"I would therefore ask Mr Costa not to add a further point of conflict to an agreement that has been under negotiation since December 2004 and which, with regard to the Gibraltar airport, will prevent that suspension and neutralisation."
"We would therefore ask you to accept this amendment, which simply restores something which has been historical, without in anyway prejudicing the safety of civil aviation."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the Chairman of our Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Costa, for his excellent report."
"His draft introduces provisions that will undoubtedly serve to improve the security of civil aviation."
"Nevertheless, there are still two points I wish to pick up."
"Several of you have referred to the first of these, namely the funding issue."
"We are speaking here of security, not of air safety."
"In other words, it is not just a matter of protecting users of air transport but all people in Europe who could be the target of attacks in which aircraft are used, as was the case on September 11."
"It seems unfair, as Mr Jarzembowski said, to burden aircraft passengers with the cost of these measures, especially since they are already overtaxed in a sector where new taxes are being invented all the time, as was the case only recently with the introduction of a tax on air tickets in some countries."
"I therefore believe that it would be preferable not to make air travellers foot too much of the bill for these measures."
"The other point I should like to raise concerns the obligation contained in Amendments 41 and 42, which would require Member States to consult and inform the Regulatory Committee before applying their own security measures."
"Although I understand and respect the idea of transparency that underlies these amendments, I wonder about the practical applicability of such proposals."
"If it is necessary to wait for the committee to be convened, informed and consulted every time an airport wants to deploy an additional security guard, I am not sure whether an obligation that took so long to fulfil would be conducive to aviation security."
"It would certainly be preferable to strike a better balance between the need for transparency and the need to act quickly."
"Mr President, it is with real pleasure that I once again express my appreciation to Commissioner Barrot for proposing an excellent solution to us."
"Commissioner, it really is a contribution to creating a safe European airspace."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Paolo Costa, the Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on his report."
"Under your guidance we have achieved a high level of agreement, irrespective of a few individual reservations."
"Protecting citizens gives them a feeling of security, and protecting air transport stabilises the aviation market."
"These are the aspects I wanted to highlight today as particularly important, especially from the point of view of those countries in which this market is in its infancy."
"In my country, air traffic is increasing by around 30% a year."
"However, I do not share the reservations concerning the supposedly excessive new competences of the Commission and the Aviation Safety Agency, as they are necessary."
"We have had five years of experience since 11 September2001."
"In the draft regulation mentioned above, we have defined tasks for governments and states, we have defined the responsibilities of airports and airline operators, we have defined the competences of civil servants and air security workers, and we have also defined the guidelines for acceptable passenger behaviour."
"The draft regulation also mentions how this programme is to be funded."
"I would urge against minimising costs as an aim in itself."
"After all, we have the responsibility to monitor air traffic security."
"Neither do we have any objections towards the proposal presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I therefore believe that our fears concerning restrictions on human rights and civil liberties are not entirely well-founded."
"The fact of the matter is that this regulation will have a positive, even perhaps excessively positive, influence on the competitive dominance of the airline industry compared to other transport sectors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the Committee Chairman, Mr Costa, for his excellent work."
"My thanks also go to all the speakers, whose contributions testify to the importance of the subject of this evening’s debate."
"The European Commission is able to accept a large number of the amendments proposed in this report."
"I shall transmit the necessary information on each of the amendments through the usual channels, Mr President.(1)"
"I shall take this opportunity to reply to some of the speakers on the question of firearms on board aircraft."
"In the Commission’s proposal amending the Regulation, chapter 10 of the Annex proposes in-flight security measures."
"Paragraph 4 stipulates that no firearms must be present on board an aircraft unless authorised by the Member States concerned, subject to fulfilment of the security conditions."
"The Commission is not proposing that firearms be permitted on board aircraft, but experience has shown that there are cases in which firearms are carried on aircraft by statesmen’s bodyguards or by security officers known as ‘sky marshals’."
"Accordingly, the Commission wants to ensure that the conditions laid down in paragraph 4 are met in such cases."
"So much for the problem of firearms on board, a difficult problem for which we have tried to find a few benchmarks."
"The Commission, Mr Costa, can endorse the creation, as proposed in recital 9, of a solidarity mechanism that could be activated in the event of a terrorist attack, but we must bear in mind that the consequences of an act of terrorism can spread far beyond the transport sector."
"For this reason, the Commission believes that this matter should be dealt with in a wider context."
"Let me move on to the funding of security."
"Back in April, I promised you a report on the financing of transport security."
"We are in the process of finalising that document, which will be with you before the summer recess."
"The report will describe the current situation and will show what is desirable to protect the public on the one hand and to guarantee the proper functioning of the single market and fair competition on the other."
"According to the study on civil-aviation security, the cost of security is borne to a great extent by users at the present time."
"For flights within the Community, security-related taxes and fees levied by governments and carriers account for one to two per cent of the average ticket price."
"I therefore agree with your committee and its chairman, Mr Costa, on the need for greater transparency with regard to taxes and fees."
"That is the way to avoid any risk of distorted competition."
"The next task is to examine the situation that would develop if some Member States were to set additional requirements."
"I certainly understand the reasons for all these amendments that relate to funding, but is it necessary to try and resolve all of these funding problems in the context of a technical regulation?"
"The regulation is there to set technical standards for the security of civil aviation; for the rest, it is true that the simplification of certain procedures can lower costs, but I really must remind Parliament that we have to take care not to delay the improvement of this security legislation."
"This is why the Commission has misgivings about the amendments on funding, especially Amendments 35 and 43."
"It is true that the funding problems require clarification, but let us be wary of delay in the adoption of this revised draft."
"I believe every speaker has acknowledged its usefulness, particularly in providing a European approach to security standards."
"Lastly, I should like to say to the lead committee that we cannot support the amendments which would entrust additional tasks to the European Aviation Safety Agency at this time."
"We cannot ask it today to assume this additional responsibility, because it already has very important functions and has some difficulty in performing them with the resources that are currently at its disposal."
"In spite of these reservations, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer Parliament, along with its rapporteur and committee, my sincere thanks, because we consider that the Commission can accept the great majority of the amendments."
"In conclusion, I fervently hope that we can proceed towards the rapid adoption of this proposal."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 37, 40, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 55, 56, 58, 60, 61, 65, 66, 67, 68, 73, 77, 78, 82, 89 and 91."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 9, 14, 18, 23, 25, 39, 42, 51, 64, 72, 79, 81 and 84 in principle."
"The Commission can agree in part to Amendments 5, 20, 21 and 57."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 3, 6, 19, 22, 32, 35, 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 45, 50, 52, 54, 59, 62, 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 80, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 90."
"– The next item is the report by Michael Cramer (A6-0183/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the deployment of the European rail signalling system ERTMS/ETCS (2005/2168(INI))."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude for the constructive cooperation on the part not only of the Commission, of the Committee secretariat, of the railway companies, and of the railway industry, but also, and not least, of the groups’ shadow rapporteurs, for it was also thanks to them that it was possible for this report to be adopted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism with nobody either voting against it or abstaining."
"The effect of ERTMS is to incorporate digital technology into the infrastructure of railways, with the prospect, after many decades, of the twenty different signalling systems still in operation today being consigned to the past and ERTMS, as a single system throughout all the EU’s Member States, replacing them."
"The system improves safety, reduces building and maintenance costs and increases capacity to a considerable degree, while also resulting in a considerable reduction in the cost of locomotives, which it will be possible to manufacture in greater numbers."
"This standardised train security system will make interoperability considerably simpler and speedier, enabling the benefits of long stretches, particularly in goods traffic, to be experienced in travelling across Europe; any substantial increase in the number of such journeys is made an impossibility by the technical and political patchwork quilt that we have now, and so it pays to make investment in ERTMS a priority and to emphasise the need for it."
"Investments in ERTMS are regarded as equal to investments in infrastructure and treated as cross-border projects, resulting in up to 50% co-funding from the EU, not only for ERTMS-compatible locomotives, but also for infrastructure – for those sections that cross borders, at any rate."
"I firmly endorse the memorandum of understanding by which the EU and the national railways have agreed to equip six corridors with ERTMS."
"These corridors are symbolic of the reunion of Europe, and the implementation of ERTMS in them will, among other things, overcome national egoisms, since it will be necessary to think and act in a European way."
"If these projects were to be successful in the short term, it would encourage further initiatives, but what is also necessary is that the issue be kept at the top of the agenda, and not only by those who take decisions in the EU; the Member States too, along with industry, infrastructure manager and rail operators must make ERTMS a priority and all push and pull in the same direction at the same time."
"If, though, trains are to be able to travel speedily into the future without damaging the environment, there are important framework conditions to be put in place."
"The external costs of the Eurovignette must be internalised, and, as an example of how to do this, we may take Switzerland, where tolls are four times what they are in Germany, are levied on all road and on all goods vehicles."
"Up to now, competition in the EU has been unfair; in Germany, for example, added on to the massive fiscal drawbacks, track charges constitute a rail toll on all trains and on all lines, whilst lorries have up to now been charged tolls only on motorways and only if they weigh over 12 tonnes."
"Not only does ERTMS offer Europe an opportunity to grow together, but it is also essential to the medium and long term development of the rail industry and to the 15 000 highly-skilled jobs in it."
"Even today, the railway industry is a hit on the export front, with orders for locomotives placed by Korea, Taiwan, India, Saudi Arabia and China, and infrastructure projects in those countries, clearly demonstrating its market potential."
"If ERTMS can build on the foundation of a strong market in Europe, it can be the standard for the world."
"I have a vision of a European rail network from Lisbon to Tallinn, from Paris to Warsaw and from London to Athens via Budapest."
"With ERTMS, it will be taking a mighty step further forwards."
"It is with that in mind that I hope that we will all, tomorrow, confirm the committee’s vote, and would ask you to reject all the amendments that have now been tabled."
"I would also ask the Council, when it votes on this, to follow this House’s example."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I read Mr Cramer’s report with great attention and interest."
"I should like to congratulate him on the quality of his report, which is the fruit of cooperation with all stakeholders in the railway sector."
"You spared no effort, Mr Cramer!"
"Not content to organise a hearing on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), you travelled all over Europe to raise technical and political questions relating to the system."
"You consulted closely with Mr Karel Vinck, European Coordinator for ERTMS."
"These are the reasons for the high quality of the report you compiled, which was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Your report clearly presents the advantages of ERTMS and spells out the three challenges that have to be met if it is to be deployed successfully."
"First of all, ERTMS is recognised as the best system in the world today for indicating permissible speeds to drivers and for monitoring those speeds automatically."
"As Mr Cramer has just emphasised, the success achieved in exporting the system outside Europe to countries such as Taiwan and Korea testifies to the potential of this system as an exportable product."
"Secondly, many lines in Europe are equipped with national and even regional systems, most of which are dated and mutually incompatible."
"Mr Cramer spoke of a ‘patchwork’, which very aptly illustrates the wide disparities between these systems in terms of safety and performance levels."
"In order to operate on a given line, a locomotive must be equipped with the appropriate system, which is why the Thalys trains need to have seven control systems on board."
"Thirdly, as long as ERTMS is not being widely used on the European rail network, railway companies are hesitant to invest in it."
"Conversely, as long as trains are not equipped for ERTMS, infrastructure providers will also hesitate to invest in it."
"As a result, it is often in rail companies’ interests to wait for others to take the first step."
"There is a need to break out of this circle of inertia and convince all players in the field of rail transport that they should adopt what is ultimately a win-win strategy."
"We can also rely on Mr Vinck, the European Coordinator, to use his powers of persuasion."
"The major freight corridors will only be competitive if locomotives are not brought to a halt at national borders by technical barriers, and to that end the Community strategy must be clearly enunciated, as Mr Cramer has shown in his report."
"It is essential to ensure that ERTMS is put in place wherever it is compulsory, especially on all the new high-speed lines."
"European funding should be confined to rail projects in which ERTMS is taken into account."
"Substantial financial incentives must be offered to the first infrastructure operators and the first train operators to equip themselves with ERTMS."
"A great deal of work has been done to make ERTMS a success, but we must step up our efforts, and to that end, Mr President, the contribution of Parliament is warmly welcomed."
"Thank you, Mr Cramer, for your work on this report."
"We must move together in the same direction, namely towards a competitive European rail environment that is able to deliver high-quality service."
"That is how we can shift part of the volume of freight traffic from road to rail in order to save energy and come closer to the Kyoto targets."
"All of this, Mr Cramer, certainly does require a bold and ambitious strategy for the introduction of ERTMS."
"In this respect, your report bolsters our case appreciably, and for that I wish to thank both you and the European Parliament."
". – Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I hope that the introduction of the single train system will be quicker and more punctual than the way we are going about things, for we are already – again – running twenty minutes behind time, and I am sure you will not mind if I go pretty soon, as I want to watch another match somewhere."
"I do not need to repeat what the rapporteur had to say, since all the groups on the committee managed to achieve compromises on essential points, and I also share the view expressed by the Vice-President."
"There are just two things I would like to point out."
"The first – and it is for Mr Cramer’s benefit – is that we should not be talking in terms of percentages, for we have as yet no idea as to how much money is in the pot for ERTMS, and, moreover, we do not yet know which projects are actually ready to go ahead."
"One project – the route from Rotterdam to Genoa – does admittedly appear to be ready apart from the last stretch into Genoa, but funding from the Member States for the other projects has not yet been secured, and so we should not be promising something that the Member States are unwilling to produce, for they, the network operators and the railways must contribute their shares."
"All we can do is add a topping of money from the TEN budget; if the Member States stonewall, then nothing will happen."
"Secondly, I hope that those Member States that can get money from the cohesion fund or the regional fund will use it for ERTMS, but, if they use it to build roads and then complain that the railways are not properly organised and too slow, then all I can say is that it is their own fault."
"With this report, we have sent out the right message, and the Commission, too, is ready to do its bit, but it is now down to the Member States, to the network operators and the railway companies to make use of this co-funding."
"If they fail to do so, then we will have moved a good idea forward while achieving nothing, and so let us all hope that the Member States may, perhaps tomorrow, read the reports of what we have been saying and decide, after all, to give this project proper support."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, first of all, I would like to use this opportunity to express to Mr Cramer my warmest thanks for his good cooperation, particularly in view of the technically very demanding and difficult nature of this report."
"We have managed to guide the report to the vote with a great deal of speed and accuracy, and that augurs well for the future of Europe’s railways."
"It is relatively clear just why this is such a pressing matter: as Mr Cramer has already mentioned, there are currently, in Europe, over 20 different signalling and speed monitoring systems, the cost of which is measured, firstly, in space on board, not to mention money, and also, of course, maximises to the utmost the possibilities for error and ultimately constitutes a safety problem."
"There is, then, a massive obstacle to interoperability, one that certainly – as you, Mr Cramer, have said – makes the railway sector less competitive, particularly in view of the constant increase in traffic and the urgent need to move it from road to rail."
"I hope that what we are hearing about the White Paper that is due to appear is no more than a rumour; the planned system is certainly needed."
"We have been able to satisfy ourselves as to the system’s operability; everything that has been said about its perhaps not working or about its working badly or something of the sort, is nonsense."
"It works in practice; it works on passenger trains."
"That is why it is of the utmost importance that the Member States should, without delay, come up with a strategy for conversion to it and for the implementation of it."
"I would like to avail myself of this, my last, opportunity to point out that, in my view, ERTMS will do more to secure the social position of workers in the rail sector, in which jobs will require better skills and high qualifications, and so the further training and qualification of workers in this sector must not be overlooked."
"Let us make use of ERTMS as a great opportunity for rail transport, and let us do everything possible to move the transfer from road to rail forward in the future."
"Mr Barrot, Mr Cramer, thank you for the work you have done."
"You said all the right things in your report, even down to the last detail."
"It is all set out very clearly."
"It is a little ironic, though, that in 2006, already some way into the 21st century, we should still be debating the benefit of a single rail signalling system."
"At a time when other modes of transport have made much more headway, cross-border European traffic has evidently never been that important to the monopolies."
"They at any rate never poured the money into it that they should have done; nor did they come up with the ideas to move things along."
"It is a little odd that we still find ourselves debating the basics where rail is concerned."
"We are pleased that, during the hearing you organised, the infrastructural people were keen to apply the European rail signalling system (ERTMS)."
"That in itself is a success, in our view."
"They could quite easily have turned round and said that they were not really interested on account of the cost and that, for the sake of those few trains that cross the border, it might be better to use lorries after all, because they can be traced by satellite."
"They could have left the trains for what they were."
"The enthusiasm we display does not really seem to be shared by those who should help to get things moving, namely the Member States, the railway companies and the infrastructure managers."
"I am, of course, following Mr Cramer’s approach here, who said all the right things."
"We have to consider the entire corridor, from beginning to end, down to the last mile."
"There must be EU funding for the cross-border sections, and one corridor should not be singled out in favour of others."
"The project must be considered in its entirety and we must keep an eye on the bigger picture."
"The ultimate goal is to rig out the entire European railway network, or at least the major lines."
"We will therefore need to find a little more than those EUR 5 billion spread over 10 years."
"The amounts involved will be of quite a different order."
"I would like to see whether the railway companies and Member States are prepared to actually put that money on the table, because that bit of European funding is only a drop in the ocean."
"There is no use pretending: we cannot act as if we are going to put a pile of money on the table."
"One cannot expect miracles with just 1% of the Gross Domestic Product."
"Member States and others refuse to face this reality and think that Europe, even if it has no money, should still be the driving force behind initiatives such as these."
"Railway companies too will need to prove that the funding they have received is being spent wisely, that they will look after, and attract, customers with a view to achieving ERTMS’s main goal – namely improved use of the network – so that rail becomes a mode of transport that can compete with other modes of transport."
"."
"Mr President, in the past, only the differences in rail width represented a barrier to cross-border and through trains."
"Since electrification, the differences in voltage and protection systems have cut the railway network up even more."
"We desperately need a common electronic protection system."
"It looks like a number of variations on ERTMS will become the generally applied standard in 20 to 30 years’ time."
"The initial investments in ERTMS have been made, and many are sure to follow."
"The certainty of constant growth is of huge benefit to industry."
"If everyone wants to apply this system as early on as at the development stage, then this may lead to shortages and prices shooting up."
"Moreover, there is every chance that at least the first software version will need to be upgraded in the foreseeable future."
"People who work for the railway companies need a great deal of preparatory training before they can start using ERTMS safely."
"For the time being, it mainly comes into its own as a secondary system alongside one of the 20 tried and tested systems."
"In the Netherlands, this has already contributed to delays in the use of new railway sections."
"Where ERTMS is applied without support of that kind, this initially leads to major delays and has, consequently, played havoc with timetables."
"In Switzerland, the average train delay during the first four months was 18 minutes and only then did things gradually change for the better."
"These teething problems mean that the system has not so far been hailed as a success by the interested parties."
"That is why, in order to turn this project into a success, we must draw a clear distinction between the experimental initial phase, during which it can be tested selectively so as to build up practical experience, and a fully-fledged phase, at which point we can rely on it 100%."
"European Union funding must focus on this experimental phase with a view to making versions 2.3.0 and 3.0.0 reliable and to possible further developments without filling the coffers of industry unnecessarily."
"Until it can be fully introduced, we must make sure that the tried and tested protection systems are not neglected and prevent a further shrinkage of the railway network from becoming a means of quickly reaching good statistics with ERTMS."
"The only way we can probably raise the necessary funds is to impose an extra levy on freight transport, as is the case in Switzerland."
"That is why the previous decision on the Eurovignette needs to be adjusted."
"."
"The competitiveness of rail is being hampered by a variety of things."
"The lack of a uniform safety and signalling system is one of those."
"Given the role that rail is supposed to play in the logistical process, I am pleased with the attention ERTMS is now getting."
"I can identify with the essence of Mr Cramer’s report, which covers most relevant aspects of ERTMS, and I share his view that ERTMS is an instrument that can help rail move forwards into the future."
"Current services are hindered by barriers that prevent competition with other modes of transport."
"Some of those barriers can certainly be attributed to the historical relations within and outside the railway sector."
"The existence of nationally-geared protection systems is without a doubt part of this."
"This fragmentation hinders the development and implementation of cross border transport and thus adversely affects the competitiveness of freight transport by rail."
"Since the introduction of ERTMS can cancel out this negative aspect, it is important that the transitional period between the current systems and ERTMS be kept to a minimum in order to restrict additional costs and functional discomfort as a result of the use of the dual systems."
"It is also important that we should have an ERTMS version that works adequately at our disposal."
"That is the case at the moment, and I hope that all those involved will make the effort to have an economically justified and technically up-to-date system in operation, now and in future."
"An important topic during our discussion was the financial aspect of the introduction of ERTMS."
"Both in the Community, in the Member States and among railway companies, only limited resources are available."
"It is therefore necessary to weigh up carefully how they should be used."
"In that context, my group has proposed a number of amendments, which emphasise that, in terms of projects, we should back clear favourites and maturity, both politically and economically, so as to make maximum use of the means available."
"I am also aware of the interest in this system from outside Europe."
"This represents prospects for industry and more employment."
"It strikes me as impossible at the moment, though, to make exact predictions about the expected effects on employment."
"Hence an amendment to exercise caution in that respect, which is also true of the beckoning prospects."
"For the rest, I am pleased about the attention that is being devoted to the importance of the full participation of those involved, namely the Community, Member States, industry and railway companies."
"The development, introduction and implementation of ERTMS equipment can only be a success if everyone does their bit."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mr Cramer for his work and the sound cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, and express the hope that all those involved will back the processes that have either been set in motion or that are yet to be embarked on."
"Mr President, we, in the EU, have for a long time been working to balance the relationship between road and rail, with regulations on the treatment of HGV drivers and train crew under social security and labour law, with injections of support and finance for rail traffic, with tolls and other levies for heavy road traffic, and, last but not least, with technical regulations on intermodality and interoperability."
"Most recently, by means of Marco Polo I and II, we made a direct attempt at supporting more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, and now, with NAIADES, we are attempting to create new opportunities for internal shipping."
"All things considered, though, we have not really had much success with this."
"On the contrary, the gap has widened."
"In freight transport, rail is continuing to lose out to road, so perhaps we will, in fact, soon see our dream melt away; after all, according to media reports today, the Commission will shortly be changing strategy and abandoning its policy of pro-active transfer from road to rail."
"Whatever the truth of those reports, we must continue to do everything in our power to equip railways and upgrade their technology."
"The new magic formula in this is ‘ERTMS’, which is intended to help make train systems mutually interoperable, so that perhaps, even if a long way down the line, rail will be given a new chance."
"We worked together on the Cramer report in order to find a common solution, and – as Mr Cramer rightly emphasised – we succeeded in this, so let us congratulate the rapporteur and the Commission too on the document we have and wish railways all the best for a good and safe future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am a staunch partisan of the European rail system, the success of which depends on three things: interoperability, funding and opening rail networks to competition."
"In this report, the political centre of gravity tends to be the opening of networks to competition, in other words the market is paramount; whenever that is the case, road transport is always the winner."
"I believe we actually want to focus on interoperability and find a way to finance it."
"Moreover, the main issue at the present time concerning the introduction of ERTMS is how to fund it in such a way that the huge investment burden does not further handicap the railways in their efforts to compete with road transport."
"From this point of view, may I congratulate our honourable colleague, Mr Cramer, on his report."
"I am not sure that there was a need or obligation to assign priority to particular rail corridors."
"On the contrary, I believe it would have been better to say that, every time a network is upgraded or a new line is opened, it must be equipped to the new standard."
"I can scarcely imagine that any new line would not automatically be equipped in accordance with the new standard."
"There is also, of course, a crucial question with regard to funding during the transitional period when the old and new systems have to exist side by side."
"If this key question is not answered, national companies are liable to be wary."
"If it is answered, Commissioner, I believe we shall win the day, and we need to win, because each of the Thalys power cars, as you said, has seven different command and control systems installed, and they also cost 60% more than other locomotives."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a comprehensive report."
"In supporting him, I would like to underline that coordinated deployment of the European Rail Track Management System, a strategic part of the Trans-European Network, should be applied uniformly to all European rail infrastructures."
"An effective signalling system with automatic speed control will help to avoid lethal accidents and will further improve the safety level of rail transport."
"Implementation of the ERTMS will provide increased security by ensuring continuous monitoring during train operations."
"It will also ease the strain on the roads and shift transport flows to the railways."
"The ERTMS is superior to national systems because it is cheaper as far as new acquisitions and maintenance are concerned and safer at all speeds."
"I agree that the old systems and the ERTMS should not exist side by side for too long."
"The transition to the new system should be as quick as possible."
"The 20 different train protection and signalling systems that still exist today should be replaced by a single system in all EU Member States in the near future."
"The sooner trains are equipped with European train control systems, thus allowing them to travel on major interoperable corridors, the sooner it will be possible to make savings on maintenance costs and eliminate costs associated with the use of multiple systems."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unanimous adoption of the Cramer report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism basically tells us two things."
"The first is what you, Commissioner, and the Members who have already spoken have stressed, which is that the rapporteur has done some excellent work, and therefore the thanks that we owe him are far from being a formality."
"The second point is that, although the concerns and the emphases may vary, I feel that there is broad awareness of the fact that we may be facing the implementation of a system that appears to be a genuine industrial project of excellence for Europe."
"That is what we need for the transport sector, and also in general to increase our competitiveness in the right direction, namely towards safety and improved quality."
"I shall confine myself to highlighting a few needs, which are already in the report but which I feel are worth pointing out."
"The first is that Mr Savary is certainly right in saying that the new system should include everything that is new."
"At the moment, however, as we are faced with the financial difficulties that we are all aware of, I think we should support the installation of the system at least along the main corridors that the European coordinator, Mr Vinck, has examined and proposed to us as the first step towards overall coverage."
"I should like to point out that the timing and procedures need to be right for the migration of the whole European network and for the current standard to be maintained, thus guaranteeing compatibility with future technical specifications."
"Mr President, I would like warmly to congratulate Mr Cramer on the exhaustiveness of his report, which deals in a skilful and in-depth manner with all of the problems that we need to overcome in order to achieve full interoperability and facilitate the removal of rail borders."
"We must also accept that the vote in committee – I believe – improved his initial proposal, by extending it and making it less restrictive, amongst other things acknowledging the efforts of those countries that are already applying it."
"I am talking about countries such as my own, Spain, where forty years of dictatorship left us completely isolated – as is currently the case with the Baltic countries which are historically linked to Russia, also by a railway of a different gauge – as a result of a different gauge of track, in addition to problems with mountains."
"The enormous efforts that we have had to make in Spain in order to renew our rail network with European funding have led us to directly apply the European signalling and speed control systems, which we are currently discussing."
"It seemed natural to the Spanish to overcome our historical backwardness and to allow ourselves to be led by our Europeanism, opting clearly for an integrated system such as the ERTMS, which represents the future of the railways."
"In fact, I am delighted because over recent weeks – and I hope that the delegation from the Committee on Transport and Tourism that will visit my region next week will be able to see this – we have managed to overcome and resolve a technical problem involving the ERTMS, which has meant that we have been able to reduce the distance enormously and make passenger transport by rail in Spain even more attractive."
"In the future we will clearly have to resolve certain problems relating to goods transport by rail, such as level crossings with barriers."
"First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Cramer for the positive outcome we have ended up with. It was not easy, given the sensitivities surrounding this issue."
"The compromise amendments that were eventually approved are very important."
"One of the points of discussion springs to mind, namely whether or not one corridor should be singled out."
"Eventually, we decided in favour of six main railway corridors."
"That is important, because we are thus sending out the message that they all count."
"Whether progress will be made or not will depend on the efforts and willpower of the Member States and companies involved."
"ERTMS’s ultimate aim must be for it to be universally applied, because a single European railway market cannot become competitive compared to other modes of transport if we continue to apply more than 20 different signalling systems."
"That means, indeed, that we must tackle entire sections rather than opt for a piecemeal approach."
"The main problem remains, of course, as most fellow Members have already mentioned, the funding of ERTMS, as well as that, moreover, of the other trans-European networks."
"That is why we must be creative and extract funds from, for example, the Cohesion Fund and, possibly in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, collect additional funds."
"These resources should at any rate be distributed evenly, but should also be spent wisely and effectively."
"I wish the Commission and the ERTMS coordinator much success in this difficult balancing act."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate centring on Mr Cramer’s excellent report."
"I shall restrict myself to four remarks."
"The first expresses my utter astonishment at Mr Rack’s allusion to a change of strategy, suggesting that we have not always been determined to give priority to rail, which, as we know, has a number of advantages in a context of energy and environmental problems."
"I refer Mr Rack to the White Paper that will be presented next week; anything other than what is set down there is sheer speculation."
"My second remark is this: there is undoubtedly a need to offer incentives, involving significant cofunding by the European Union, in order to ensure that the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is deployed."
"Mr Savary has emphasised the risk of penalising the railway system."
"This is why we opted for 50% cofunding of the introduction of ERTMS."
"Time will tell, but for my own part I believe it is a good motivating factor."
"Thirdly, while it is true that the specifications of such a system are always open to improvement, it can be said today that the system works."
"The Rome-Naples route in Italy is not behind schedule and has been operating very well since the end of 2005."
"What we can say is that the current version of the specifications already suffices to guarantee interoperability and can therefore be used in calls for tender."
"Even though ERTMS will have to be perfected, there is no reason, on the basis of the present specifications, to postpone the installation of ERTMS."
"My fourth remark concerns the corridors."
"It is true that the Coordinator selected corridors with a view to obtaining a clearer picture of the costs and benefits of deploying the system and trying to encourage the various players to work together."
"That, however, does not predetermine the inclusion or exclusion of particular corridors."
"The Commission, acting in accordance with the Financial Regulation, will favour the best projects and the corridors that will be capable of providing high-quality projects within an appropriate time frame."
"These are the remarks with which I wanted to accompany my thanks to Parliament and its rapporteur for this excellent contribution to a policy which is essential if we want tomorrow’s railways to become a European rail system and a rail system with the potential to relieve the road network."
"That is really the crux of our efforts, and I am delighted with the contribution of Parliament, to which I extend my heartfelt thanks."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report by Seán Ó Neachtain, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore-fishing communities [2004/2264(INI)] (A6-0141/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, let me begin with , as we say in the Irish language – meaning ‘a few words’ – on the title of this report."
"Following the final vote in committee I was asked if I would be prepared to accept an amendment in plenary to modify the title of the report, which refers to ‘fishermen’, so as to implicitly recognise the important role played by women in that important sector."
"It will not come as any surprise to you that I fully support the Miguélez Ramos/Kindermann amendment, which is totally consistent with the contents of the report and simply introduces the notion of gender equality in the title."
"Like you, I learned on Monday that this amendment was inadmissible."
"Like many of you I found that hard to believe."
"However, you will be pleased to know that this evening the Conference of Presidents has approved the change in the title of my report."
"From the outset, had I been allowed to draft this report in the Irish language, the problem would not have arisen because I would have used the word , which, unlike the English word ‘fisherman’, is gender-neutral and embraces all those involved in the sector."
"There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union."
"This aspect of the fisheries sector is the poor relation that has been ignored for far too long."
"The subject matter is vast and varied."
"It concerns every single coastal Member State, in most instances in totally different ways."
"That is one area of the fisheries sector where there is the odd reference, here and there, among the plethora of EU legislation, but no Community rules and regulations that specifically cater for the sector."
"I believe that anomaly has to be corrected."
"Inshore fishing essentially takes place in waters that come under exclusive national jurisdiction, and yet inshore fishermen, in many instances, are subjected to common fisheries policy regulations while reaping few of the benefits."
"Inshore fishing is about the economic and social fabric of our small coastal communities."
"It makes a vital contribution to local economies where, in many instances, there is precious little else in the way of work."
"Inshore fishery activities essentially maintain the social fabric of those communities."
"They are also essential for the preservation of cultural traditions and practices, which must be preserved."
"And yet that sector has been ignored for far too long."
"The future development of the inshore fisheries sector is dependent on social change."
"It is dependent on the existence of appropriate representative bodies."
"It is dependent on creating demand for improved added value produce through appropriate marketing structures."
"It is dependent on resolving the economic aspects that influence operating costs."
"Most importantly, it is dependent on the adoption of appropriate EU programmes specifically designed to help the sector."
"The inshore fisheries sector is badly in need of development and modernisation."
"That includes boat modernisation, notably where safety on board is concerned."
"We must devise measures to minimise the effects of the increase of variable costs that results from high fuel prices."
"If that means adapting boat engines so that they can run on a high percentage of alternative fuels such as bioethenol then we must take the necessary measures to adapt boat engines accordingly."
"We must do all we can to attract young men and women to the sector in order to ensure its continuity."
"I fear that will be impossible if we do not implement adequate vocational training systems geared towards concerned groups of the inshore fisheries population, not least the development of marketing skills."
"I believe that we must develop new ways of commercialisation and fully integrate coastal fishermen into the marketing process."
"We must also enhance cooperation and communication channels between organisation and stakeholders concerned."
"My report is not – as some lobbyists would believe – an attack on recreational fishing in any one Member State."
"It is about the specific social, economic and environmental problems of the entire small inshore fishing sector in all Member States of the European Union."
"It is about promoting sustainable fishing."
"This report is a contribution to resolving problems in the inshore fishing sector, not to creating new ones."
"My approach is to try to find the appropriate solutions so that different economic interests are catered for in a mutually acceptable way."
"It would be incorrect for any interest group to read any other interpretation into the text."
"Commissioner Borg, this report and this Parliament are calling on you to consider a new Community initiative for this important sector of activity."
"The men and women involved in the inshore fisheries sector are calling on you to consider a new Community approach."
"I believe that we have an obligation not to disappoint them."
"Knowing your personal commitment to fisheries, I know that you will not disappoint them."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, who has presented an excellent report."
"I should also like to extend my thanks to the whole Committee on Fisheries for having taken up this important subject in the form of an own-initiative report."
"It is clear that small-scale coastal fisheries are in many ways different from fishing activities conducted by larger boats."
"Many of these differences are highlighted in the report, and I should like to mention just a few."
"Small vessels stay close to the coast and mostly conduct fishing trips of a single day."
"The businesses are small and mainly family-based, and in most cases only one person operates the vessel, with the maximum being not more than three."
"The catches are landed and also often marketed locally, thus making this segment more dependent on the local economy."
"This part of the fishing industry is fragmented and not equally represented in shipowners’ organisations."
"These vessels operate in coastal areas, which are often biologically fragile, and where there is a lot of competition with other users, such as other fishing vessels or recreational fisheries and tourists."
"However, I should like to stress that not all of these differences are disadvantages."
"In fact, some of them are distinct advantages, such as the freshness of the landed fish."
"However, it is also true that coastal fisheries have handicaps, and I agree with most of your conclusions in this respect."
"I absolutely agree that it is not an easy task to define coastal fisheries, but this is exactly why I would strongly recommend basing ourselves on the definition which is used in Community legislation: vessels of up to 12 metres not using towed gear."
"This definition was agreed almost ten years ago and is a good basis for further action."
"However, it does not mean that at national or local level additional criteria could not be used when defining the role of the different players in coastal fishing areas."
"On the contrary, coastal management actions and plans should include further criteria depending on the specific settings of the area and the fleets involved."
"Let me now turn to your specific suggestions."
"Here, again, I agree with most of your proposals, and in particular the establishment by local fishermen of coastal management plans, the harmonisation of data on coastal fisheries, the improvement of training for men and women involved in this type of fishing, better coordination of all aspects affecting coastal areas and fishermen, the improvement of vessel safety and of the safety culture for those involved, the need to recognise the role of women and improve their legal work status and, last but not least, the better involvement of coastal fisheries in decision-making and representatives bodies, such as the RACs."
"But this leads me to the question: who does what?"
"I am deeply convinced that it is first and foremost the local fishing communities themselves who have to come together, get organised and propose actions and initiatives."
"Secondly, many of the aspects that were mentioned are under the responsibility of the Member States, for example education and vocational training, jurisdiction over coastal areas up to 12 nautical miles, and the control and enforcement of safety standards, etc."
"However, I also agree with you that we have a role to play at European Union level."
"You, the European Parliament, have started with a study, the hearing of last November and this own-initiative report we are discussing today."
"The Commission has already started work too, and I have proposed specific treatment under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted next week."
"Among other possibilities of particular interest to coastal fishers: the proposed European fisheries fund reduces to 20% the private contribution for the modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships."
"It gives them more favourable treatment in the conditions for engine replacement and urges Member States to give ‘safety tonnage’, preferably to smaller vessels."
"I think that this is a package of better treatment for this segment, which will contribute to bringing about some of the improvements mentioned in your report."
"In addition, there are several areas of the common fisheries policy where coastal fisheries are treated differently or exempted from obligations, such as the requirement to use a logbook, remote sensing and VMS requirements."
"In relation to conservation, however, small-scale fisheries have to take full responsibility in the management of fish stocks, because coastal waters are often the place where fish spawn and grow in the early stages."
"Before concluding, let me just mention that my services have recently commissioned an important study, which is under way at this very moment, and which will give us a new and up-to-date insight into several cases of small-scale fisheries located in different regions and seas of the Community."
"The findings of this study are expected in the coming year and I am sure that they will help us to assess whether further action is needed and how to tailor it."
"I take up your suggestions and, building on your valuable work, will join forces with all the stakeholders, the Member States and, last but not least, all those who make a living from coastal fisheries in order to engage in concrete action to improve the situation and the conditions for this segment of the fishing fleet."
"Thank you for your attention."
"."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and I must say that the work done by women throughout the fisheries sector and particularly in inshore fishing, should be given greater legal and social recognition."
"Although just 3% of women take part in extractive fishing, many women are intensely involved in the other activities relating to fishing."
"With an economic structure made up mainly of small family businesses, the majority of women work very hard but have no economic or social rights, since they do not have a sufficiently clear work status, and in many cases they work in conditions that are highly prejudicial to their health."
"As we state in the report, therefore, it is urgent for both the Commission and the Member States to take the measures necessary to guarantee all of these women their rights."
"Furthermore, women working in this sector should have access to funding, to credits and professional training under equal conditions to men."
"We must also guarantee that women participate in the decision-making, representative and advisory bodies of the communities dedicated to inshore fishing."
"At a time when the sector is undergoing restructuring, significant changes are taking place that affect women directly or indirectly and both men and women must therefore take part in the search for solutions."
"We would therefore like a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies to the effect that they should take the appropriate measures to ensure that they contain a balance of men and women."
"The lack of data broken down by gender makes it extremely difficult to seek solutions to the problems faced by women working in the sector."
"We would therefore call upon the Commission, by means of the European Gender Equality Institute, to find a rapid solution to this issue."
"Making these women more visible also requires using correct language to reflect the fact that there are men and women in the fisheries sector, and not just men."
"I am therefore very much in favour, and we support, the proposal that the rapporteur has also just advocated to change the word ‘fishermen’ to ‘fishing communities’ in the title of this report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow groups such as women working in inshore fisheries to go unprotected."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality calls for greater recognition of the work of these women and for solutions to the specific problems stemming from that work to be found."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on behalf of my group on his magnificent report, which could not have been produced if he had not been generous enough to accept many amendments and suggestions from other Members representing different fishing regions with very different views of small-scale fishing."
"We must not forget that these vessels represent around 80% of all Community vessels and this kind of fishing is practiced in all of the coastal Member States, although in each one it has special characteristics."
"It is precisely the treatment of this aspect, which seems to me to be one of the greatest achievements of the report, since it has stipulated a series of criteria, which can indeed be common to the majority of the small-scale fleet, which in some Member States is defined by length, in others by the type of processing of the fisheries product, by distance from the coast or by the duration of tides, or by a combination of several criteria."
"The definition of small-scale fishing on the basis of the twelve-metre length, as in the case of Community legislation, therefore, is not in line with reality, and we hope that the Community legislation will be amended in this regard in the near future."
"It is also appropriate to stress this fleet’s responsibilities and obligations in terms of the conservation of stocks, since, although they are small or medium-sized vessels, we must not forget that there are very large numbers of them and they fish in waters that are very vulnerable to over-fishing, since these areas are characterised by a high concentration of young."
"I would finally like to point out that a high proportion of the fleet still has to deal with the issue of safety."
"I would therefore like to insist once again that the future European Fisheries Fund must take account of the modernisation and renewal needs in terms of safety and also in terms of energy saving, with a view to alleviating the crisis faced by the fisheries sector as a result of the rise in oil prices."
"I do not believe that the agreement adopted in Coreper and which is going to be presented to the Council of Ministers offers all of the measures that this Parliament called for in the Casa report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFP), in which there were many more measures which would undoubtedly make the renewal and modernisation of small-scale fisheries much more flexible."
"."
"Mr President, by means of this report, the European Parliament is explicitly acknowledging the fundamental contribution of inshore fishing, not just to local economies, but also to the maintenance of the social fabric of coastal communities, which are so much in need of cohesion elements."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, on his fine idea of proposing this initiative report at a particularly sensitive time for small communities, which are facing problems that need to be dealt with urgently."
"Firstly, their ancient vessels, whose modernisation we must continue to support, particularly with a view to improving the living and working conditions on board and to establishing a culture of safety, which must start with safer and more modern boats."
"Secondly, the lack of young people."
"I agree with the rapporteur that a Commission initiative is required in the field of training in order to encourage young professionals to join the sector."
"Training must go further, however."
"It must include work safety on board, the protection of resources and the protection of the sea and coastal areas."
"Properly regulated inshore fishing is an essential factor in the conservation of the ecosystem."
"Training must also consider improving the quality of catches, their marketing and the management of small businesses, because these issues can help small-scale fishermen to consolidate their business results and improve their living standards."
"I would finally like in particular to congratulate the draftsman for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, Mrs Riera, who has made very valuable contributions that have enriched the report."
"Women play a fundamental role in the sector and, properly organised, they can make a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of communities dependent on fishing."
"."
"Mr President, we think it is a good thing that the specific problems involving inshore fishing are recognised in this report and that the Regional Advisory Councils have come up for discussion in this."
"My group has two objections, though."
"First of all, we would like to call attention to subsidiarity."
"The differences between the regions are too significant to attempt a harmonisation process in this sector."
"Also, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe feels that the EU funds should be used to promote sustainability in inshore fishing, for example by reducing fuel consumption, rather than to increase capacity."
"If our amendments on those two points are not pursued, my group will be forced to abstain in this respect."
"We would in any case like to thank the rapporteur for the fact that he has brought inshore fishing to our attention with his own-initiative report."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, for his initiative in highlighting the special needs and the economic and social importance of the inshore fishing sector."
"It is a vitally important network of mostly small, mostly family-run businesses, which are the lifeblood of most of our small coastal communities."
"Around the coast and the many islands of Scotland, it is a sector that is of the utmost importance and it undoubtedly has not benefited from the political support it deserves."
"Unfortunately, though, Scotland’s offshore fishing industry has not had a happy experience as a result of the common fisheries policy."
"So there is not a great demand – to put it mildly – for new EU legislation specific to inshore fisheries."
"However, support for initiatives in, for example, the fields of vessel safety, fuel economy, training and investment funding is worth pursuing at local and EU level, through the European Fisheries Fund."
"In Scotland it is not just the CFP that has been bad for our fishing communities."
"Over the years, the Scottish and UK Governments too have failed to support EU initiatives by cofinancing."
"I hope that if, as a result of this report, we move towards some specific new programmes to assist coastal fishing, the Scottish Government will be persuaded to provide the necessary support."
"Our small coastal communities have a very long history, with generations of families making a living from fishing."
"I would like to see those communities returned to a state where the young and the future generations have some hope of being able to follow in that tradition."
". – Mr President, inshore fishing, especially small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries, make a considerable contribution to the socio-economic well-being of coastal communities, both in Portugal and in other coastal Member States."
"As we have pointed out, inshore fisheries make a considerable contribution to the socio-economic wellbeing of coastal communities, contributing to local development, job preservation/creation both upstream and downstream, supplies of fresh fish and the preservation of traditional local cultures."
"The economic and social crisis affecting the fisheries sector is of particular concern for the less competitive fleet segments, especially the inshore fisheries."
"In our view, this crisis is also associated with the guidelines and implementation of the common fisheries policies, insofar as it fails to recognise the specific needs of inshore fisheries."
"Accordingly, this sector of the fleet needs support at both national and Community level."
"Broadly speaking, we welcome this report. We should like to highlight the reference to the need to acknowledge the specific nature of small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries in the CFP, to adapt the current instruments so as to meet the needs of the sector, and to continue with the granting of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the small-scale traditional fleet under the future European Fisheries Fund."
"That being said, the report falls short of what is required as regards the immediate response to the problems associated with the current crisis and the new instruments needed to carry out a proper assessment of the specific nature of this sector of the fleet."
"Against this backdrop, we tabled two amendments."
"The first relates to the need to set up a Community programme to aid small-scale traditional fisheries, which will support specific projects and help to focus the instruments and channel funds into inshore fisheries."
"The second takes account of the need for emergency measures to respond to the desperate socio-economic situation in the sector, and accordingly proposes to establish emergency transitional compensation to offset the effects of the increase in the price of fuel."
"We hope that these proposals will enjoy Parliament's support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and thoroughness of the report he has presented."
"We have been highlighting the need for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries, particularly in the Mediterranean, for a long time, repeating what has been confirmed with due emphasis in the report we are debating today."
"Unfortunately, the short time I have available will not allow me to examine in any depth some interesting points such as gender equality in the fisheries sector, safety on board fishing boats, alternative energy sources in view of high diesel prices, and modernisation of the fleet."
"I am pleased to point out that inshore and traditional fishing – and I say this as a man from the south of Italy, who lives in close contact with the seafaring world on almost a daily basis – not only represents an extremely important source of income for thousands of European families living around our continent’s coasts, but also brings with it a centuries-old tradition that Europe must, in my view, support and preserve."
"Supporting inshore fishing means, , protecting it from unregulated fishing by vessels flying the flags of third countries that brazenly carry on their activities subject to no controls and without any regard for the quantity, quality or species of the fish they catch."
"Southern Italy’s fishing community has recently protested about this for the umpteenth time, this time in Bagnara in Calabria."
"The European Union should not force our fishermen to accept restrictions and sacrifices while leaving non-EU fleets in the Mediterranean completely free to do as they like."
"The inshore fisheries sector can and must make this important economic activity compatible with preservation of the marine environment, which is both necessary and incumbent upon us."
"On these and other grounds I fully support this report. I must particularly stress paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution, which calls on the Commission to recognise once and for all the specific nature of inshore and traditional fishing in the common fisheries policy, since it has been poorly treated so far."
"Mr President, I commend the rapporteur for his hard work in drawing attention to the needs of an often neglected sector in fishing."
"In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, our sector is equally feeling the pressures identified in this report, and indeed a recent political decision to deprive the white fish fleet of tie-up aid, as compensation for losses inflicted by the cod recovery scheme closure has put added pressure on the inshore sector and on inshore fish and shellfish stock, because those denied tie-up aid are forced into the domain of that sector."
"However, UK fishermen’s experience of the common fisheries policy, whatever the Conservative Party might now say, has been so negative that, in consequence and in conscience, I could not advocate what amounts to the full extension of the common fisheries policy controls to the inshore sector."
"This is where I part company with the rapporteur."
"He thinks that the answer for the inshore sector is more Europe."
"I disagree, for two reasons."
"Firstly, yes, we need marketing assistance, fleet modernisation, fuel assistance, and proper recognition of the potential needs of inshore fishing, but the imposition of European harmonisation – fishing gear control, data collection, a new Community initiative – is the path, I fear, to restriction, not to growth."
"Secondly, only some countries would take up the match funding opportunities which might arise in return for EU regulation and competence."
"Countries like mine, the United Kingdom, would not take that up and therefore disparity in this sector across Europe would intensify, not diminish, and my inshore fishermen would have all the pain of EU regulation, with none of the gain of available assistance."
"For those reasons I am obliged to say that I cannot support this report, although I readily acknowledge the genuine motivations the rapporteur had in bringing it forward."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ó Neachtain, and to welcome the Commissioner here."
"I too believe that the inshore fishing community is very much the backbone of our fishing community."
"However, after our experience with the common fisheries policy in the south-west of England we dread it extending its tentacles even further."
"I think we have to look at the overall take of fish – not just what has been caught inshore, but also what has been taken further out to sea – because, whether we like it or not, there is a limited number of fish and the future of inshore fishing relies greatly on adding value to the fish that is caught."
"When talking about inshore fishing we must also not ignore recreational fishermen and anglers, because they are very much part of the future."
"We really must make the most of the fish that is caught."
"Fuel prices and costs are an important factor and there again we need to look to the future."
"We might not have electrical boats now, but we could in the future."
"The vessels up to 12 metres long, which is what we are referring to, are quite large vessels and capable of catching a lot of fish."
"So we have to be careful about the size of the nets."
"That is where I disagree with Mr Allister, because we have to sustain fish stocks and ensure that the larger fish are caught and the smaller ones are left to grow."
"If we do not face up to the fact of diminishing fish stocks, whatever policy we bring in will not create the extra fish that we all need."
"– I should like to join in the congratulations on Mr Ó Neachtain’s excellent report and his consistent commitment on this issue that is so close to our hearts."
"I should like to say that inshore fishing is a concept that should be defined in terms of its economic, social, environmental and technical aspects, as well as the geographical reality to which it applies."
"In this regard, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Members of this House to the reality of life in outermost regions such as the Azores and Madeira, where there are no continental shelves and where the coastal equivalent is effectively the coastal banks, which are sometimes a long way from the islands, but which to all intents and purposes represent exactly what the coast close to the land represents for other continental situations."
"This is extraordinarily important to us because if this adaptation does not take place, we will not be able to understand the real situation in these regions. I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to take this into consideration."
"Mr President, the report on inshore fishing and the problems facing inshore fishermen accurately describes their current situation."
"In Poland a large number of old vessels were scrapped as part of the reforms."
"The limited viability of catches as well as a lack of financial resources means that it has been impossible for them to be replaced."
"A large number of family businesses involved in fishing and fish processing have closed down."
"At the moment, on the coast itself, it is difficult to buy fresh fish, something that used to attract tourists and holidaymakers."
"There has been a significant flow of people, and young people in particular, away from the fishing industry."
"The measures proposed in the report include access to cheap fuel, financial and investment aid for fishermen and family enterprises and career training and education for young fishermen and those interested in a career in fishing."
"These measures can successfully counteract the marginalisation of this fishing sector."
"The implementation of these measures would facilitate the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs in regions where there is currently high unemployment."
"This kind of aid is important in social and economic terms and guarantees consumers the uniqueness of a local cuisine based on fresh fish."
"The launch of the European Fisheries Fund is particularly important."
"Adopting the report and implementing the proposals it contains will be welcomed with great gratitude by fishermen."
"I would like to thank Mr Ó Neachtain for drawing up this report."
"I support the rapporteur’s recommendations."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Ó Neachtain for the work he has done in performing a careful analysis of the problems facing inshore fishing in the European Union."
"The report quite rightly considers the role of women to be important at last, recognises their difficulties in operating in this sector, refers to the subject of on-board safety, and highlights the importance of professional training and the role that inshore fishing can have in protecting and conserving the coastal marine environment."
"I should, however, like to mention two aspects that are important for my country, Italy, and not only for the south of the country but also for the northern Adriatic."
"First, I believe that inshore resources need to be protected and that legislation is needed to ensure that fishing is sustainable and does not harm the environment."
"However, the proposal to ban all fishing techniques that threaten the survival of inshore resources and the economic sustainability of the social fabric associated with fishing may well be a fair provision but it would leave many operators in difficulties, in that they would be left without work for lack of any feasible alternative proposals for a sector that is already going through a serious unemployment crisis."
"Secondly, insufficient attention has been devoted to producers’ associations and the positive role that they could play in contributing to the socio-economic development of fisheries-dependent communities."
"Being able to relate the management of local fisheries to local conditions and to the Member States would reinforce the principle of subsidiarity that our fishing communities would like to see in the management of inshore fishing, and would bring their problems closer to the source of solutions."
"The Regional Advisory Councils themselves should encourage dialogue between the European Union and local actors."
"These councils, seven of which are planned although only four have been set up, are considered neither functional nor powerful enough to manage small-scale fisheries resources, since they are only advisory bodies."
"To conclude, I should like to thank Commissioner Borg for the important work he has done, particularly in connection with the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, which proposes making the various sectors involved in the management of maritime policy interact with each other."
"– Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction with all the findings and proposals set out by the rapporteur and to make a number of comments."
"We all know that inshore fishing is the basic economic activity in disadvantaged and isolated regions of the European Union."
"For example, in Greece, inshore fishing has the largest number of boats (96% of the fishing fleet) and the highest rate of employment."
"The sector needs financial support in order to replace and update the fleet."
"The arrival of young workers in inshore fishing, apart from any family connections they may have, means that certain support policies need to be applied, given that even the report talks of the financial difficulties of both owners and workers and their limited borrowing capacity, factors which have an adverse impact on attracting young people to this profession."
"In addition to vocational training, this policy could include specific incentives for young fishermen."
"The role and contribution of women in family inshore fishing businesses needs to be acknowledged."
"The European Union should help to organise inshore fishing by helping their associations to create infrastructures, move products and improve fishing methods."
"It should be pointed out here that their organisation prevents them from being properly represented in decision-making bodies and at public hearings."
"The active participation of coastal organisations throughout the European Union in a dialogue during which priorities and completion deadlines at local, regional and European level are determined must therefore be one of our objectives during the consultations."
"Mr President, Mr Ó Neachtain’s report is an interesting case of the rapporteur searching for the root cause of a very complex problem, one which is not easy to assess."
"This problem is that of inshore fishing."
"This is because in the general sense this term still covers industrial, artisan and holiday fishing."
"As is the case with any field that is hard to define and that is ambiguous, it is doomed to be marginalised and to remain outside the main current of Union funding and investment programmes, when inshore fishing in fact makes up around 80% of all sea fishing."
"There is a lack of investment in the sector, it is neglected and faces great technical, social and economic difficulties."
"The shortage of funding to modernise fishing equipment results in increasingly defective fishing vessels and, what is worse, cases of vessels sinking."
"Everyday conditions are getting worse, and catch statistics are falling."
"This popular and long-traditional fishing sector simply seems to be running out of clear prospects."
"The appeal for action is thus entirely justified."
"Action is needed to secure the fundamental bases of inshore fishing."
"The Member States need to implement common protection mechanisms that will guarantee its existence."
"These mechanisms are more effective if they take into account the specific situation of this kind of fishing and the inherent conditions, technical needs and economic framework of the relevant inshore zones."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the truly wonderful report he has prepared for us."
"Inshore fishing is of great importance."
"It is of economic, social, cultural and environmental importance."
"It is of economic importance because it secures an income in what are often poor remote island areas."
"It is of social importance because most are small family businesses and, if this type of fishing is lost, they too will be lost."
"It is of cultural importance because these areas have a strong element of tradition and, if these fishermen go, a slice of European culture will be lost with them."
"It is of environmental importance because this type of fishing does not damage or causes the minimum possible damage compared with other types."
"We must not forget that 44% of the labour force in fishing is engaged in inshore fishing and that 75% of the fishing fleet in the European Union is engaged in inshore fishing."
"These two statistics tell us a great deal."
"I wish to say that inshore fishing needs to be protected and, when we say protected, we mean safe boats."
"People who go out fishing must believe that they will return home safely, which is why we must support modernisation."
"Young people need to be attracted to this profession because the population is aging, they need to be able to sell their products, so that middlemen do not eat up money which should end up in the pockets of fishermen and consumers, problems need to be addressed, such as rising prices and, finally, we need to make a huge effort to keep our seas clean, so that we have fish in our seas for a thousand and one other reasons."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for the valuable remarks they have made, and I have taken note of the various points raised."
"I shall try to reply briefly to some of them."
"First of all, I agree that women should be given and should take every opportunity to establish gender parity."
"The Commission will do its utmost to bring this about by all available means with regard to fisheries, particularly coastal fisheries, where women are more prominent than in the other fisheries sectors."
"On three specific points that have been made, the granting or otherwise of tie-up aid is a national matter and the reporting and control are aimed more at larger vessels than at smaller ones."
"Smaller vessels are in many instances either exempt, or have less stringent requirements to comply with."
"With regard to the specificities of inshore fisheries, I need to underline again that up to a distance of 12 nautical miles these are largely subject to Member State jurisdiction."
"The EU is not really involved in the control of fisheries within the 12-nautical-mile limit, other than in exceptional cases."
"I also agree that the specificity of different coastal areas has to be taken into account."
"We are actually doing that in the Mediterranean proposal, and I hope that later this year I will go back to Council to try and have the Mediterranean proposal adopted."
"As I said in my opening remarks, there is quite extensive provision for the promotion of small coastal fisheries in the European Fisheries Fund."
"I would also like to say that, after a long and difficult balancing act, we have finally hammered out a compromise deal allowing Coreper to agree on the European Fisheries Fund, and it will now feature as an ‘A item’ at this Monday’s Agricultural and Fisheries Council."
"To outline how the European Fisheries Fund seeks to attain this assistance to small coastal fisheries, first of all there is a reduction of the private contribution to modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships to 20%."
"The European Fisheries Fund gives them more favourable treatment and conditions for engine replacement for vessels of up to 12 metres, in which case engines can be changed without reduction of capacity on a one-to-one basis."
"Member States are urged to give safety tonnage, preferably to smaller vessels."
"The European Fisheries Fund also allows for young fishers to be offered favourable conditions for training and the purchase of a first second-hand vessel."
"The Fund can also be used for projects aimed at bringing about gender equality."
"It provides for the promotion of processing and marketing, which could be beneficial to coastal communities and fishers."
"The Commission will carefully examine the results of the study it commissioned earlier this year when they are available, and will decide, on the basis of the findings, what measures can be proposed next year and whether there is scope for a Community initiative on coastal fisheries."
"Mr Ó Neachtain’s report will also be taken into account."
"However, my view is that we should not over-regulate in such a sector; we should help mainly by providing assistance for coastal fishers to overcome the handicaps that they face in exercising their profession."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"– The economic and social crisis that is affecting the fisheries sector in Italy, which has been hit by management costs of over 40% and losses of income of around 25% in the last three years, is hurting the less competitive elements in the fleet most of all. The inshore fishing industry has been hit particularly badly in that it is more affected by the highly unstable fuel prices and the rise in variable costs."
"In addition to economic difficulties, the inshore fishing sector also has to face the lack of a specific legislative framework."
"The European Union must take a realistic attitude and agree to adopt definitions that are not too strict."
"The future regulation for the Mediterranean, for instance, should provide for adjustments to be put forward at a national level."
"The Commission needs to recognise small-scale inshore fishing and traditional fishing as a special case within the common fisheries policy, while taking account of the fact that certain coastal areas, particularly in island or outermost regions, are heavily dependent on fishing and the satellite industries that it generates."
"It needs to analyse how adequate the current instruments are for responding to the sector’s needs, and it should involve representatives from the industry to a greater extent in the decision-making process."
"In Ireland, inshore fishing is an industry with special social and economic importance, providing jobs, maintaining remote coastal communities and preserving traditional cultures."
"It requires skills and knowledge passed from generation to generation of families."
"It is important that such an industry thrives."
"The exclusion of inshore fishing from current Community legislation is creating an environment in which mere survival is questionable."
"It is so important that inshore fishing be developed, making it attractive to the employment-seeking youth."
"The job is generally associated with low wages and unreliability."
"Many must seek further part-time work to supplement their income."
"In Ireland, the Celtic Tiger economic boom has resulted in higher-paying, stable occupational opportunities for young professionals."
"An issue which should be addressed concerns the sourcing of funding aid through the European Fisheries Fund for inshore fishermen badly affected by legislative or policy changes relating to their fishery."
"From 2007 on, 1200 Irish salmon fishermen face the loss of their livelihood due to such legislative and policy changes."
"Inshore fishermen are very vulnerable to the implications of the designation of Special Areas of Conservation."
"It is necessary that provisions be made to compensate those affected by such designation."
"The next item is the statement from the Commission on Level 2 implementing measures for Directive 2004/39/EC, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID)."
"."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, who could not be here tonight, I should like to thank Mrs Kauppi, who has been an outstanding rapporteur in terms of her mastery of this difficult and highly technical subject and her willingness to work constructively with the Commission and all parties."
"She has done a first-class job, along with Mrs Berès, the chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Thanks also go to the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work."
"Under the terms of the Prodi Declaration, the Commission is committed to taking the fullest possible account of Parliament’s view."
"We have more than met that obligation."
"Indeed, we have incorporated around 90% of Parliament’s amendments into the Commission’s draft measures, which will be voted on by the European Securities Committee at the end of this month."
"On all the key points we agree."
"The level of institutional cooperation on this file has been exemplary."
"It shows that Parliament, the Commission and Member States are able to work together in a sensible and pragmatic way in order to achieve the right result for Europe’s financial markets and Europe’s investors and consumers."
"The Lamfalussy procedure, which we have all worked hard to develop over the past few years, works."
"Of course it is important to agree as soon as possible on the European Parliament’s legitimate right of call-back, which the Commission supports."
"We believe that Lamfalussy procedures will serve us well in the years ahead, allowing us to adapt our legislation rapidly to keep pace with market and technological developments, while maintaining essential democratic checks and balances."
"The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive will intensify competition among investment firms, stock exchanges and other trading venues and improve standards of service to investors and benefit companies by lowering the cost of capital."
"It will update the single passport for investment firms, allowing them to operate across the European Union on the basis of an effective single authorisation and across a wide range of financial instruments."
"Aside from stimulating cross-border competition, it will diversify the range of products and services that investors can access and markets that firms can tap into."
"But crucially and essentially, investor protection rules will be harmonised at a high level so that investors can feel confident in using the services of investment firms wherever they are in Europe and wherever the investment firms originate from in Europe."
"Furthermore, these rules are principles-based in that they put the onus on firms to behave and to always act in the best interests of their clients."
"The rapid globalisation of financial markets is an opportunity for Europe."
"These implementing measures for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive mean that we are well placed to stay ahead."
"Our financial markets are in good shape."
"They are growing strongly and are set to grow even faster in future as the Union enlarges further, as our middle class expands and as people increasingly take responsibility for their own pension provisions."
"Our common regulatory framework is more or less in place."
"MIFID is the last piece of the jigsaw where markets are integrating fast."
"The European financial landscape is becoming commercially more attractive."
"Leaving politics aside, the potential stock exchange measures represent a vote of confidence in Europe, in our stock exchanges, our technological prowess and our regulatory system."
"In the end what matters is that the cost of capital in the EU remains as low as possible overall for all EU economic actors, that European Union financial markets are properly regulated by European regulators, that European Union markets can grow strongly, that cross-border clearing and settlement costs are significantly reduced and that the European Union, through its new regulatory regime, can influence and develop strongly its financial relations with the rest of the world, using its good emerging model of regulation as its passport."
"The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is a key step towards positioning Europe as a global leader in financial services."
"That is why the Commission is particularly thankful to Parliament for its cooperation on this vital subject."
"Mr President, we can all be very satisfied with the resolution before us."
"It is based on a remarkable effort by the Commission, the European Parliament, the European Securities Committee Regulators and market players, which has resulted in the successful conclusion of the implementing measures for MIFID."
"The directive itself is nothing short of revolutionary in the way it opens up investment markets in the EU and achieves better guarantees for investor protection than in previous legislation."
"The implementing measures before us, which establish some 17 key provisions of the directive, represent balanced and measured regulatory arrangements for bringing these twin promises to fruition."
"The procedure by which these implementing measures have been drawn up is also highly significant."
"This is the first time the European Parliament has been fully involved in concluding implementing legislation at the comitology phase."
"In the end, the percentage of Parliament’s amendments scheduled to be adopted by the ESC is about 87%."
"This compares highly favourably with, for example, what we obtained in the underlying MIFID directive, where that percentage was about 50%."
"All the parties involved can feel justified pride in the way we managed to overcome potential interinstitutional pitfalls since, as we all know, Parliament’s role in comitology is the topic of an often heated debate."
"In fact, we are still awaiting some answers from the Commission and Council."
"I should like to address special thanks, however, to the Commission for its open and forthcoming cooperation with me and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was instrumental in bringing about this very positive outcome."
"I agree with the remarks made by the Commission on Monday to the effect that we have achieved something historic not only for the financial markets but also in the manner Level 2 legislation and other comitology legislation is framed."
"Despite the positive outcome, I should like to mention a few points."
"I am somewhat perplexed that the Commission did not accept our modification which sought to clarify the best execution obligations of investment firms towards clients when dealing on their own account."
"I hope that the Commission and national regulations will interpret the resulting provision in the light of the agreement reached in the Level 1 Directive."
"Furthermore, I should have liked to have seen more flexibility on the delayed reporting of large trades."
"We will have to be vigilant and promptly invoke the review clause if it becomes apparent that premature reporting of large trades is harming the provision of liquidity to clients, making it more expensive or rendering EU markets less competitive than markets in other parts of the world."
"Finally, I had hoped that a more modern interpretation of the business in derivatives could have been found."
"It will be important to amend the Level 2 measures promptly if it becomes apparent that new clients and new markets, especially transactions using the Internet, are being disadvantaged."
"The number of criticisms is nonetheless dwarfed by the overall positive result."
"I should like to thank all the participants and all my colleagues who helped in this endeavour."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you can tell Mr McCreevy that, here in the European Parliament this evening, we have followed the entire Lamfalussy procedure for the first time."
"The European Parliament has contributed to that effort in a way which, I believe, will be commended by everyone for its quality and professionalism, and it has also defended, at Level 2, the balance between the achievement of open markets and the transparency principle we defined for Level 1."
"What we have done here in the European Parliament has focused primarily on the parliamentary contribution to the proper functioning of what is known as the Lamfalussy procedure and on our reasons for hoping that the agreement on the exercise of the implementing powers assigned to the Commission will guarantee the rights of Parliament."
"We also welcome the Commission’s acceptance of a number of our proposals designed to improve the balance in the areas of transparency and consumer rights."
"Lastly, allow me also to draw your attention to the content of our resolution regarding the role, powers and intervention rights as a market regulator of the Committee of European Securities Regulators, which coordinates the activities of national regulators."
"The Member States must accept their responsibilities and give this body the resources that will enable it to ensure the proper implementation of this Directive, on which the efficient financing of our economy depends."
"Commissioner, when we began this whole adventure, some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs argued that, besides the market itself, we should concern ourselves with what happened further down the chain, with what are known as post-trading activities, namely clearing and settlement."
"As you yourself observed, these post-trading activities are too costly today."
"For this reason, although I am not one to glorify market forces, I believe that what is applied elsewhere should be applied here, namely decoupling, which ought to be a good way to reduce costs."
"I hope that the Commissioner will not intervene too belatedly or too timidly in this domain, as he has indicated to some market operators."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my warm thanks to all those who took part in the preparation of this resolution and documents, especially the amendments, creating legal premises for the emergence of a united investment services market."
"For me, as the representative of a small and new European Union Member State, the kind cooperation of competent and more experienced colleagues is the best proof that we can work together in an enlarged Europe and implement important reforms together."
"I believe that I really must stress this."
"Another thing I would like to mention is that we have to look to the future, as the rapid and ambitious development of financial markets brings new tasks every day."
"I am sorry that Mr McCreevy is not participating in our debates today, and that neither he nor the European Commission have played much part in the current reorganisation period of Europe's financial market."
"Therefore, based on experience I have gained myself, I would like to point out the things we ought to emphasise when discussing the global challenges of the world's financial market."
"I feel that our strategic goal ought to be the aim to follow the development route of our own distinctive European financial market regulation model."
"We need to stress this more and more as we seem lost amid aggressively expanding markets."
"We have our own particular European financial market traditions and must foster these and mention them more often."
"I agree with the opinion of the Commission Member that Europe now has great opportunities to become a leader in the field of financial market regulation, considering the very thorough regulation practice of the United States of America and the problems faced by states with new developing economies in the field of regulation."
"What should the elements of that distinctive European model be?"
"First of all, we must state clearly that we will use principles-based regulation, and not strive for detailed rules-based regulation, as the former is far more flexible and means it is possible to react to changes in the global market more rapidly."
"While preparing the MiFID documents, it was said that a more detailed regulation would guarantee a united approach in implementing the anticipated measures in all European Union states, but it is possible to achieve the same by better coordinating the work of supervisory institutions."
"The second element of the model ought to be provisions encouraging the convergence of the interpretations and requirements of supervisory institutions."
"No rules will help avoid, let us say, the different financial cultures which exist in southern Europe, Great Britain and northern Europe."
"Thus, we must rely on and the experience of the northern market as we coordinate a united interpretation of legal norms."
"I take a sceptical view of the proposals by the European Central Bank to create harmonised standards or proposals to provide more legal documents in order to establish the market."
"We have sufficient documents; we simply ought to devote more attention to their convergence."
"Clearly, in future, the financial market will possibly need its own united supervisory institution, but this is a prospect for the future and not very practical at the moment."
"The third thing I would like to mention is that financial market efficiency must be assessed by taking into account the views of the end consumer, which would mean the separation of services, the disclosure of the internal expenditure of huge financial conglomerates and the management and exposure of conflicts of interest."
"– () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start thanking not only Mrs Kauppi, the rapporteur, but also all those, the shadow rapporteurs in particular, who have worked on this highly complex topic, for their great effort."
"Once again, I have to say how deeply disappointed I am in our Bureau; today is an historic date, and on it we have been provided with evidence of how effective parliamentary participation is in the committee procedure."
"Within the institutions, we – the representatives of the citizens, of the people of Europe – are actually achieving something, and, as we debate it shortly before midnight, we are enjoined to keep things brief."
"This is not the first time this has happened."
"I know that the Bureau and the powers-that-be are not interested, yet, all the same, I shall not tire of saying that we should concentrate on showing the public the rights that this House possesses."
"At the moment, we are discussing the reinforcement of Parliament’s rights in respect of committee procedure, specifically the Lamfalussy procedure."
"In the week in which the decisive sessions are to be held, the Bureau schedules debate on it for just before midnight; no worse message could be sent about the subject."
"The good thing that has emerged from this evening is that we have demonstrated that this House plays a cooperative role in dialogue with the Council and the Commission, and that this is not our fault."
"I call on the Council, both this week and next, to take this positive example to heart."
"We have demonstrated that we, through the procedure of our committees, can come to decisions that are more efficient, that make possible better regulation and hence also the continuation of the Lamfalussy procedure, that is to say of this House’s right of review, with this House notified in good time and the perspective afforded by the institutionalisation of the call-back."
"We should adopt something to this effect."
"I see that the gavel is about to come down; in this House, time is the most important thing."
"Even so, the Commission should take care that, in the financial markets – for that is what this directive is about – there should in future come into being a European model in which the strengths of all parties are taken into account."
"Mr Radwan, I must point out to you that it is not the Bureau that sets our agenda but the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I would like to support the remarks made by various speakers on this being a historic moment."
"I am not referring to the time of five minutes to midnight, but to the historic moment in which we reached this sound agreement and were able to modify the proposal."
"I say the proposal, because the Commission did not like that terminology, but I think this is what has been done, through the good cooperation and professionalism of the people involved."
"I would also like to emphasise our adherence to the Lamfalussy procedure and cooperation between the different players in the field, and to underline what Mrs Berès said about the role of the regulators and the importance of getting the tools to enforce the legislation and measures we have now adopted."
"This enforcement needs tools and instruments and it is up to Member States to provide them."
"The last point I want to mention is something I think we have to discuss with the Commissioner responsible, Mr McCreevy."
"I hope we can invite him to the next Strasbourg session and have a debate – maybe not at such a late hour as this but earlier in the day – on the developments in the stock exchanges."
"I was particularly surprised by something he said the day before yesterday in a speech in Ireland."
"He compared the globalisation of the financial markets with an ocean steamer and said that the European Union is on the bridge, in control and taking the lead in this process."
"We are not sure that this is in fact the case, because the Commission is not proactive in what is happening at the moment in the market."
"We are keen to debate this with him."
"."
"Mr President, I thank Parliament for the very valuable contribution it has made to the whole process."
"I consider that this is a perfect example of how well all three institutions can work together to the benefit of the European financial markets."
"Europe should be proud today to give itself a regulatory framework for financial markets which will put it at the forefront of the world’s financial centres and improve the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole."
"I congratulate everyone for achieving this result."
"On two proposed amendments which were not accepted by the Commission – Amendments 4 and 7, to which the rapporteur made reference – I should like to say that with regard to the disclosure of the identification of the client, the Commission favours a more flexible approach."
"Practices, as well as assessment of the usefulness of requiring identification, vary in Member States."
"It can be an invaluable tool in the investigation of market abuse."
"The Commission prefers to leave this issue unharmonised at this stage."
"The Commission is not in favour of Amendment 7, which relates to deferring the publication of information relating to portfolio trades."
"Our current proposal on portfolio trades is that the block regime will apply with respect to each constituent share."
"If accepted, the amendment could weaken transparency requirements."
"By including only one transaction for which delay is permitted in a portfolio trade, a delay for the whole portfolio would be obtained."
"Finally, I am certain that Commissioner McCreevy will gladly accept your invitation to discuss this subject further with you at the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 96 of the Rules of Procedure provides that our activities shall be made public, and therefore I believe that it is important to acknowledge the possible consequences of the statements made in this Chamber too."
"I refer to the declaration made by Mrs De Keyser on Monday concerning the eight deaths in Gaza, a declaration in which she claimed – I quote word for word – that the killings were a deliberate act and that, in 1987, the first Intifada was started by a less serious incident."
"Since this statement, which met with applause in this House, has been disproved by an Israeli investigation from which it turns out that the incident was probably caused by a bomb, I believe that, in our capacity as Parliament, we should be more circumspect when faced with news of this kind and wait to hear how the events actually unfolded, because, otherwise, our statements are liable to have repercussions that we do not want."
"I am sorry, but that is not a point of order."
"We take note of what you say, but it is not a point of order."
"The next item is the report (A6-0185/2006) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud – 2004 annual report [2005/2184(INI)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this report on fraud for the year 2004, we should keep in mind that the irregularities, and I stress again that these are irregularities and not fraud – since fraud usually only makes up a fraction thereof – remain relatively stable at hardly 1% of the EU budget."
"It is of course interesting that within the budget there are certain shifts that may be observed over the medium term and the long term."
"In this connection, we above all welcome, and can even note with pride, the fact that in recent years we have achieved massive reductions in irregularities in our biggest area, namely agriculture."
"From 2003 to 2004, losses were reduced by approximately 50%, from EUR 170 million to EUR 80 million."
"Conversely – and unfortunately – we have to note that losses from the Structural Funds have increased from EUR 482 million to EUR 694 million."
"We can unanimously ascribe the receding figures for agriculture to the fact that the Integrated Administration and Control System is obviously having an effect."
"Wherever it is applied, there are positive results; so of course we must insist even more firmly that the InAdCo System is indeed applied."
"In our report we note critically that, as long as seven years after the expiry of the implementation deadline, an old Member State, namely Greece, has not yet applied it. Of course we encourage the Commission to attend to this matter, because these methods of proceeding must be applied across the board."
"The next point to attract our attention relates to pre-accession aid."
"Everything that has to do with enlargement is politically sensitive, but we have to make sure that, in this area too, things are done properly in budgetary terms."
"The extent of the suspected irregularities is cause for concern, but far worse is the fact that the Commission, by its own admission, does not really know what kind of irregularities these are, and consequently does not know either what is recoverable or how it may be recovered – and this in as many as 90% of cases."
"In other words, the Commission is practically blind in this affair, and so we must take precautionary steps."
"We know that the administrative capacities of the accession countries are indeed somewhat smaller, but I would ask Parliament and the Commission to take this into consideration in future budgets. We do not want to pour extra water into barrels that are already full, since in the end this will cause them to overflow."
"In last year’s report on the fight against fraud we dealt with cigarette smuggling as a top priority, and we are – frankly – proud that important work has been done here by the Commission and by OLAF."
"Twenty-four countries, including the new Member States, have now entered into the agreement with Philip Morris – with one exception, which we regret: Great Britain."
"We would certainly like the Commission to spend the payments due from Philip Morris – in total around EUR 1 billion – in a sensible way, and we think it regrettable that, so far, it has been unable to do so."
"The Commission should provide concrete suggestions and initiatives for the use of this income."
"We estimate that, in the EU in 2004, cigarette smuggling caused the loss of customs revenue worth around EUR 418 million – and this trend is set to increase."
"This is an issue that needs to be solved at European level. Measures taken by Member States will be of little use."
"For the first time we have also included VAT fraud."
"We estimate that Member States lose 10% of VAT revenue every year through VAT fraud, and I would like emphatically to urge the Commission to take this matter further in conjunction with the European Parliament and to support it in doing so."
"Finally, I turn to the imminent reform of OLAF."
"On 24 May the Commission adopted the proposal for a regulation; however, even now it has not yet passed this on to Parliament, and so the parliamentary process cannot yet begin."
"Today, we shall, however, propose some clear guidelines on this issue. Thus, for example, Parliament will not agree to any regulation that restricts its rights in any way."
"As far as OLAF’s work is concerned, priorities have increasingly shifted in recent years away from OLAF’s original primary task, namely that of carrying out investigations, and towards coordination functions and providing a platform."
"Expansion of coordination activities must definitely not occur at the expense of investigations, since the outward effects of this could be fatal."
"If the discussion on reform is to include a possible extension of OLAF’s activities, then the Commission and this House must be clear from the beginning that this will necessitate further financial and human resources. We both need to come to an agreement about this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for the way in which he has dedicated himself for years to the fight against fraud, and to protecting the financial interests of the European Union."
"We have here one of the most positive reports on this area in recent years."
"The report is of course a reflection of reality."
"The Commission welcomes this constructive report and supports most of the views expressed in it."
"I would like first of all to mention the statistics and trends in respect of discrepancies reported by the Member States in 2004."
"We must always guard against drawing hasty conclusions from the statistics relating to these reports."
"Member States that report large numbers of cases are generally trying harder to meet their obligations than the States reporting fewer cases."
"The sums are also estimates and do not reflect budgetary losses, since correctional measures are implemented immediately."
"In the areas of own resources and agriculture the sums are falling, as has already been stated, while in the area of structural activities they are increasing."
"As Parliament has emphasised, the IACS system has had great success in the area of agriculture."
"The Commission is striving not only to reduce the number of discrepancies and the steps applying to them, but has also undertaken measures in 2005 through which some of the old Member States have improved the way they report discrepancies, through the use of electronic systems."
"I would now like to focus briefly on the contents of the report."
"Concerning the reform of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the Commission adopted a proposal on 24 May 2006 to amend Regulation 1073/1999, under which OLAF was established."
"What are the main elements of the OLAF reform?"
"It is necessary first to state that, in respect of carrying out investigations, the Office is an operationally independent unit of the Commission, and its existing structure is functioning well."
"The Court of Auditors confirmed this fact in its special report on the establishment of the Office."
"In this context the proposed legislation would make the investigative activities of the Office and its political administration more effective, while respecting procedural and individual rights during investigations and transfers of data relating to investigations, and also retaining the independence and confidentiality of the Office’s investigative activities."
"The Commission believes that this is a well-balanced proposal, the aim of which is to improve the way the Office operates, and the effect of which really will be to bring about such an improvement."
"The Commission hopes that Parliament will be able to give some thought to this proposal as soon as possible, as the first discussions have already taken place in the Council within the framework of the relevant work group."
"Turning to the fight against cigarette smuggling, I would like to say a few words on this subject, particularly on the agreement against cigarette smuggling that has been concluded with Philip Morris International."
"The Commission would like to thank Parliament for its unstinting support in this area."
"The Commission is delighted that 24 out of the 25 Member States have already backed the agreement, the only one not to do so being the United Kingdom."
"This fact testifies to the success and importance of an agreement which is the first in this area and which establishes cooperation between the authorities and industry."
"The figures for seizures of Philip Morris International cigarettes are of particular significance to OLAF and the Member States."
"To give you some idea – in 2005 OLAF and the Member States notified Philip Morris of almost 300 individual seizures, amounting to more than 400 million cigarettes."
"Of this total, 85-90 % were counterfeit."
"The seizures allow us to identify key areas in the fight against smuggling and counterfeiting, and this is extremely important."
"In practice the agreement has shown itself to be a highly effective instrument in the fight against cigarette smuggling."
"The Commission hopes that it will serve as a model for other cigarette producers."
"The report mentioned the issue of how to use the resources obtained."
"The Commission intends to put forward a proposal in the near future on changes to the Pericles Programme over the years 2007–2013, which will give an important place to the fight against smuggling and counterfeiting as an objective meriting the allocation of financial resources."
"The report justifiably took up the particular problem of VAT fraud in the Community and the significant losses accruing to the Member States."
"All efforts aimed at intensifying cooperation between Member States and between the Commission and the Member States deserve maximum support."
"The proposed procedure dealing with mutual administrative assistance, to which Parliament has given a positive response, is an important initiative."
"When will OLAF, as a unit of the Commission, be able to provide the Member States with added value?"
"This initiative falls neatly into the framework of the communication on a European strategy for the fight against tax losses, adopted by the Commission on 31 May."
"It states that the level of tax losses is becoming an increasing concern, and that the Member States cannot act effectively in isolation."
"The aim of the Commission is to improve the mechanisms for practical cooperation between individual Member States and between the Member States and the Office."
"As you can see, there are a whole series of important legal measures under preparation at present, or under discussion with the Council and Parliament."
"At many different levels, all of these measures will strengthen the protection of financial interests and secure improved cooperation between various bodies."
"The area of protection for financial interests is an area of shared authority, and the Member States have a decisive role to play in making it succeed."
"The Commission and OLAF hope that Parliament will continue to be a powerful ally in this project."
"An effective structure for combating the misuse of European finances is fundamental to winning the trust of citizens."
"The trustworthiness of our official bodies is all the more important now that it has been so difficult to reach agreement on the new financial perspectives."
"Allow me to express a view on the individual amendments."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 3, 4 and 5."
"In the case of Amendment 2, on Eurostat, the Commission submitted a situation report on 12 April 2006 dealing with the Eurostat affair."
"The report indicated that the range of measures approved should guarantee that similar discrepancies will not recur."
"OLAF has completed all but one of the inquiries."
"Concerning the financial effects of the discrepancies and reimbursement of the debts, the Commission is not able at the moment to provide any information additional to that which is in the report."
"Some matters are still under discussion in national courts, and it is therefore not possible to provide more exact information."
"In the case of Amendment 6, the Commission believes that the internal system for excluding firms which it currently has in place answers this demand sufficiently."
"This system is available and is maintained by all of the Directorates General in the Commission and not just by the Directorate for Research."
"The idea of a blacklist as an instrument for prevention is really promising."
"For this reason, the Commission has proposed within the framework of the revised Financial Regulation to extend the database of excluded firms so that Member States can use it too, along with the other partners involved in administering Community funds."
"The problem with this amendment from the perspective of the Commission is not its abstract internal essence, but the fact that it is only a partial proposal within the framework of a wider system which is under development, which is effective, and whose further development is still an open question, in the opinion of the Commission."
"I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Bösch for his report, which, as the Commissioner also said, is a good and positive report and that will receive our support."
"I would like to make two brief points."
"Firstly, now that we have confirmed the appointment of the Head of OLAF, I would like to send the message that we should let this office go about its work without putting any spokes in its wheel."
"The OLAF is a vital office in the struggle against fraud and it is therefore important that we let it work in peace and not under continuous pressure and tension from our part."
"We need to open a new chapter and allow OLAF to work."
"Then, if OLAF does not provide results, we can return to the discussion."
"Secondly, the Commission has just put forward new proposals for revising the regulation concerning the setting up of OLAF."
"We have great interest in this process and we would like to see this change bring a much stronger, much more efficient and much more effective office."
"However, this should also include the independence of OLAF."
"Mr President, our group gives great importance to the protection of the European Union's financial interests, for the simple reason that we must show a clear commitment to ensuring that taxpayers' money is not only used properly but is also shown to be used properly."
"Given that the European Union is using taxpayers' money, this is our duty."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the general acknowledgement of the work of my fellow Member Herbert Bösch, of his determination to protect the Community’s financial interests and his monitoring of the activities of OLAF."
"This year we are pleased, therefore – myself in particular, in view of the references to aspects of agriculture that involve my country – with the clear improvement and the quality, as well as the reduction in fraud in the Member States and, in particular, the success achieved with regard to contraband cigarettes, which demonstrates that the Union is able to impose itself on those multinationals that sometimes appear to be impossible to control."
"This year, however, we also have a new aspect which is very worrying and in relation to which we all – but especially the Commission – have to show greater responsibility: is respect for the fundamental rights of the people being investigated guaranteed?"
"I say this because the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 6 April 2006 in the IRELA Affair, which demands that the Commission pay compensation to a civil servant and which roundly condemns the investigation carried out by OLAF, requires that we reflect and react in a profound and radical manner in order to ensure that the revised Regulation on OLAF investigations, which is being prepared for presentation, irrefutably and clearly guarantees the independence of the control of the legality of the investigations carried out and, above all, maximum respect for the fundamental rights of the people investigated, in full application of the principle of prevention."
"Our Union, the Communities and our institutions cannot lecture the countries around us, and our own Member States, on respect for people’s fundamental rights if here we are not able to maintain that principle of prevention and respect for the fundamental rights of the people working here when they are subject to investigation."
"Afterwards is always too late."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a parliament has many tasks."
"Not only does it draft and simplify laws, but it also monitors certain decisions and the question whether those decisions have been carried out correctly."
"One of those core monitoring tasks is to inspect the implementation of the budget: it has to check whether the more than EUR 100 billion which is used to carry out European policy has been spent well and correctly, whether European taxpayers’ money has been used wisely and efficiently and whether it ends up in the right hands."
"For the 2004 budget year, the irregularities and fraud reported by the Member States amounted to nearly EUR 1 billion."
"Whilst, in the past, we could see that most of those cases pertained to agriculture and to a lesser degree to expenses in structural policy, we can now, as Mr Bösch rightly said, detect a buck in the trend: there are now more reports in respect of the Structural Funds, and fewer regarding agriculture."
"This drop within agriculture is, of course, wholly attributable to the effectiveness of the integrated control system."
"Against this backdrop, I should like to emphasise that it is unacceptable that one Member State, Greece, should still remain in default seven years after the event."
"Mr Bösch has managed to aptly summarise what has gone wrong, and he has not minced his words in doing so."
"He used the extremely efficient method of naming and shaming, and quite rightly so."
"Partly thanks to the support of the anti-fraud Commissioner, Mr Kallas, in the past year, we managed to force a number of Member States to publicise the final beneficiaries of the agricultural funds."
"That has given us a good insight into the spending pattern of agricultural funds and into the anomalies."
"More than anything, it taught us once again that the funds do not always end up with the farmers, but with major food giants."
"I think that we should now take things one step further and force the Member States to publicise the final beneficiaries of the Structural Funds, including the Regional Development Fund and Social Fund."
"I should also like to use this debate to pay tribute to the people of the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF."
"They are doing sterling work, although they have sometimes come under criticism."
"Mr Bösch is right in mentioning in his report a number of negative points, but we should always remember that enormous progress has been made over the past eight years."
"I should like to finish off by saying a few words about two very fraud-sensitive areas, namely VAT fraud and cigarette smuggling."
"VAT fraud must be addressed, and I welcome the Commission’s communication in that respect."
"With respect to cigarette smuggling, I will be publishing an own-initiative report later on in the year."
"I am delighted that, despite the fact that an own-initiative report will be issued, Mr Bösch has already devoted a number of paragraphs in his report to this very issue."
"We have struck a deal with Philip Morris, and the money that we generate from this deal should be ploughed back into anti-fraud policy."
"As Commissioner Špidla was right in saying, I think that we, along with the Commission, must examine how those funds should be used, for example in the Hercules programme."
"We will need to put much of our time and energy into this in the coming months."
"."
"Mr Bösch, first of all, thank you."
"What now though?"
"In 2004, nearly 10 000 irregularities were reported involving European funds, but those are, of course, only the cases of fraud and incompetence that we know about."
"We can only guess at the exact level of fiddling that goes on behind our backs involving European money."
"I myself fear that this is only the tip of the iceberg against which the ship of the European Union is bound to shatter into pieces."
"The European citizen is becoming ever more critical of the EU, and money wasting is one of the main reasons for this justified criticism."
"Two per cent of the Structural Funds are spent on fraud or some other form of mismanagement."
"Given the enormous sums involved, I find this a very worrying percentage, as it translates into hundreds of millions of euros wasted, at least 20% of which, according to the Commission, is accounted for by direct fraud – self-enrichment at European, national and regional level."
"It is necessary, in my view, to carry out a Europe-wide assessment of the effectiveness and fraud sensitivity of, in particular, the European Social Fund."
"The European anti-fraud office OLAF should commit to fighting fraud in Europe as its main task."
"Unfortunately, in many cases, this guard dog has often emerged as nothing but a lap dog."
"One characteristic of this situation is the fact that Parliament is still in the dark about the extent and implications of the Eurostat fraud that came to light back in 2004."
"This is completely at odds with the efficiency and transparency which the Commission claims to pursue in this communication."
"However, it would be unfair, where failing fraud control is concerned, to point the finger at Brussels alone, because the Member States are certainly just as guilty."
"They turn a blind eye to fraud or do not come down hard enough at any rate."
"It is unacceptable that the lion’s share of fraud cases should occur in old, relatively rich Member States, including Germany and Spain, and that, moreover, those countries should submit incorrect and incomplete reports on fraud cases on their territories."
"A clear tit-for-tat policy should apply here: if Member States fail to address fraud and the waste of European funds adequately, this should have consequences in terms of the level of funds they receive."
"That also applies to my own country, the Netherlands, by the way, when it refuses to name specific perpetrators in fraud cases."
"Even more important is the prevention of fraud."
"This can be done by simply cutting off the most fraud-sensitive money streams, for example export subsidies in agriculture, for it is a well-known fact that many of the fraud cases take place in that area."
"Apart from all other moral objections I have to export subsidies, this seems to be an excellent reason to put an end to this ridiculous and harmful form of support."
"Mr President, the protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud require an effective control system, which the European Union does not have."
"I have the utmost regard for the European Court of Auditors, but its reports give a very superficial picture, and in reality we do not know very much about how EU money is actually spent."
"Basing budgetary control on the DAS system, or in other words on issuing positive statements of assurance on the reliability of the accounts, does not allow abuses to be uncovered."
"For this reason, abuses are more frequently uncovered by the press than by the appointed control bodies."
"What is worse, the European model is recommended to Member States and in Poland, for example, I have noticed that the greater the similarity between budget execution reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control and the reports of the European Court of Auditors, the less real information they contain about irregularities and abuses that are occurring."
"We should seriously rethink the system for budgetary control in the European Union; its reform should move in the direction of increasing control."
"Not only checking the reliability of accounts, but also checking specific irregularities and abuses, analysing their causes and making recommendations for their rectification, and also recognising and highlighting mechanisms fostering corruption should become key parts of the system of control in the European Union."
"We should also create the necessary conditions so that the European Parliament can use reports from national control bodies, in which a huge amount of information regarding the spending of EU money is included, which we have not been using at all up to now."
"This matter should be resolved systematically."
"Mr President, we are talking about abuses, so please permit me a small verbal abuse of my own, namely one sentence on another subject: it is precisely in this House that my country, Poland, has been accused of racism and xenophobia."
"I would like to express my complete rejection of this accusation and to say that in Poland for many years nobody has even had a hair…"
"…on their head harmed due to racist accusations."
"I wanted to say that because I did not have the chance to speak in yesterday’s debate."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch has carried out a very conscientious and, in certain respects, brilliant survey of irregularities and fraud taking place in various parts of the European Union and in a number of its authorities."
"It is, however, one thing to discover what is going on and another subsequently to ensure that action is taken to remedy the situation."
"It is the main task of this House to demand accountability."
"Parliament is not, however, fulfilling its task in this area."
"Firstly, we must be able to determine who is responsible."
"Many of us in this House have tried to implement an arrangement whereby, in each country, a cabinet minister or other minister appends his or her name to a guarantee that EU resources have been used correctly in his or her own country. As a result, that politician is known to be accountable."
"Secondly, we must demand accountability once we have discovered who is responsible."
"Parliament should do this by refusing to grant discharge when there are problems."
"This is not being done."
"There are hidden connections of which we are unaware."
"As rapporteur, I myself found unsatisfactory states of affairs in the Committee of the Regions and requested that we postpone the decision on discharge, but almost everyone voted against this proposal."
"Only the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe changed sides, which is to their credit, while the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refused, as usual, to demand accountability."
"This is a situation that must be changed."
"– Mr President, if anyone is seriously interested in this whole area – and it is, after all, a matter of protecting the financial interests of the Community – then I would recommend him to read about how this House has already discussed this matter on similar occasions and, above all, to read what amendments have been discussed in the Committee in the run-up to the report and then later not adopted."
"More specifically: this report does no more than barely scratch the surface of the fundamental problems in this Union."
"If we go the heart of the matter, then we are not dealing with 1% irregularities, but with much greater funds that are – at the very least – not being spent in a sensible way."
"I am thinking of the EUR 5 to 7 billion for Tacis and many other areas, for example administration, where money is wasted."
"This report, therefore, is so limited that it amounts to little more than a smokescreen, because it does not address the really essential questions."
"Even the rapporteur himself says that nobody has any idea what kind of irregularities we are dealing with when it comes to enlargement."
"Despite this we admit new countries, because the crux of the matter is that the institution that is actually supposed to deal with irregularities is potentially a great embarrassment for Parliament."
"The Commission has, accordingly, made proposals on how OLAF is to be reformed."
"Clearly, this report falls short of those proposals."
"Amendments have been rejected, demanding that OLAF should work in a proper, reliable and comprehensible manner – at least in the limited areas in which it has been active until now."
"However, all of these demands were rejected by the Committee."
"Now we are told that it is great that we have already got so far."
"No, we have not got that far yet, not by a long chalk."
"In so far as investigations are carried out at all, they are arbitrary."
"When people act as if they are prosecuting fraud, but then fail to do so, these procedures are unconstitutional."
"We are faced here with an absolutely crucial problem for this Union: namely, that money is simply being wasted in many areas."
"Most of you know this, but we should not pretend that this report is going to bring about a great improvement."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF and its officials deserve our thanks and our appreciation for doing a very difficult and very important task."
"The result can be seen clearly: OLAF is an important and powerfully effective partner for Europe in the fight against fraud."
"I would like to invite Mr Martin to back up his accusations of allegedly unconstitutional procedures."
"It is in our vested interest that OLAF, as part of the budgetary authority, always grows stronger as a partner."
"However, if we now review the last fifteen months, then actually the Commission has not done very much to strengthen OLAF."
"Long-drawn-out appeal proceedings were heard; with the result that institutions were weakened and people were damaged."
"Now it is announced that OLAF is to be strengthened."
"The European Parliament will watch over the independence of OLAF with Argus eyes, according to the new legal bases."
"I would sincerely ask the Commission to formulate the draft so that it may be judged in these terms."
"We shall carefully scrutinise it, to see how serious the Commission really is about fighting fraud."
"The more independently OLAF is conceived in the draft, the greater the Commission’s interest in combating fraud."
"I would like to assure you of our support."
"There are many other initiatives being worked out that are directly aimed at combating fraud, for example the Green Paper on the transparency initiative, and the question of whether to publish the names of the recipients of subsidies or at least to make them public, to bring them to the attention of the Commission."
"We have a first draft that includes these things, I mean the Budget Regulation which is present in draft form."
"Now, for everybody’s sake, we must send a reminder to the Council about this and follow it through, otherwise the fight against fraud will remain incomplete and be a toothless tiger."
"– I too should like to congratulate our rapporteur on his outstanding report and to express my support for most of the remarks that have been made on various sides of the Chamber. I especially welcome the remarks made by my fellow group member Mr Staes, who rightly raised the issue of farming, a major problem area in the context of the Community Funds."
"Most importantly, I wanted to say to the Commission, face to face, that it is crucial that the condemnation of OLAF by the Court of First Instance in Case T – 309/2003, as my fellow group member Mrs Ayala Sender has brought to our attention, be followed up by action."
"This is not just a matter of forcing the Commission to provide compensation for a Commission employee."
"What we must do is condemn a whole series of investigation procedures carried out by OLAF, which failed to comply with any of the rules that must be followed under the rule of law, which failed to uphold the principles of exemption and impartiality, which failed to give the accused any opportunity for defence, and which, lastly, ensured that an investigation – an absolute fiasco – was directed against people who had absolutely nothing to do with the affair, rather than against the true culprits."
"This is not right, and if it is conducted in this manner I must state very clearly that I do not understand what the Commission's transparency policy is trying to achieve."
"This must be followed up by action."
"Under no circumstances can a society governed by the rule of law sanction such a Court ruling without action being taken."
"Mr President, in speaking in this debate I would like to turn your attention to what, in my opinion, are the most important issues."
"The first of these is the ever-increasing level of activity in the Member States in terms of uncovering irregularities and abuses relating to European Union funding, although there are unfortunately countries among the old Member States which pass on information regarding abuses to the Commission several years late."
"The second issue is the clear fall of over 50% as regards confirmed losses in agriculture expenditure, from about 170 million in 2003 to 82 million in 2004."
"This deserves special mention owing to the fact that European Union agricultural aid has several million beneficiaries."
"The possibility of irregularities and abuse is therefore potentially very high."
"The third issue is the disturbing growth in losses relating to the Structural Funds, from EUR 482 million in 2003 to close to EUR 695 million in 2004, and mainly in the old Member States."
"The fourth and final issue is the huge scale of losses suffered with regard to own resources in connection with the growing incidence of smuggling, mainly of tobacco products, trade in fake goods, and also VAT abuses."
"According to estimates by experts, the latter account for as much as about 10% of all revenue from VAT in individual countries."
"In turn, losses resulting from increased smuggling require additional funds for securing customs borders, particularly on the European Union’s eastern borders."
"Mr President, a bit less fraud here, a bit more fraud there."
"This report is a sad catalogue of failure – failure to direct enormous amounts of EU funds to where they were intended."
"But this is just one of the ways in which EU funds are wasted."
"Despite all the apparent good intentions, a large proportion of the cash is spent on daft projects that advertise the EU or support the disgraceful common agricultural policy; and all this has spawned a whole industry of bureaucrats who exist merely to produce the relevant paperwork for applying for and dealing with the grants."
"Another huge waste."
"EU money is easy money – provided you fill in the forms nicely, or forge them."
"The whole system has fallen into contempt."
"Where is the incentive for Member States to use their own resources to police the use of the funds?"
"Let us stop fussing about how we achieve marginal reductions in what we call fraud, and instead think more deeply about the true value that is added by all this misuse of EU taxpayers’ cash."
"– Mr President, instead of constantly looking for new sources of funding, for example in the form of new EU taxes, and instead of constantly increasing the level of expenditure, it is in my view high time to intensify the fight against fraud and waste."
"It is precisely during the payment of EU grants – made at appropriate points throughout the Member States – that irregularities occur time and time again. What is remarkable is the increase in fraud cases in several Member States of the EU."
"Member States should, finally, either resolve their lack of administrative capacity in this regard or be made to make good the losses that arise from it."
"In my view it is indeed important that we optimise OLAF and constantly look for new solutions to improve our fight against fraud."
"However, all these changes will achieve little if OLAF dossiers are not rapidly processed, because the responsible officials in the Member States are overworked, and if the recovery of erroneously paid funds is not handled rigorously."
"In my opinion, we must, finally, act decisively so that the fight against fraud does not just remain a pious wish."
"Mr President, the report addresses the issue of cigarette smuggling comprehensively."
"It is very important to fight against cigarette smuggling, because it does not only endanger our financial interests, but consumer health, too."
"Smuggling poses a particularly serious problem in Hungary, because taxes are significantly higher than in neighbouring non-EU states."
"By now, this has resulted in a 25% increase in the market of untaxed cigarette products, causing huge damage to the Hungarian budget."
"Cigarettes are smuggled from Ukraine, Romania and other Balkan states."
"I wish to mention emphatically that duty free shops are operating on the Romanian side of the Hungarian-Romanian border, where travellers can purchase cigarettes to bring them in duty free, often in order to sell them in Hungary and other European Union Member States."
"In view of the imminent accession of Romania, the Romanian Government should close down these duty free shops immediately."
"However, smuggling will continue to be a problem even after the accession of Romania to the European Union, because Romania was granted transitional exemption in order to reach minimum tax levels; this means that we will have to monitor continuously whether Romania is able to enforce the excise regulations of the European Union, and whether it is able to prevent smuggling to other Member States, such as neighbouring Hungary."
"Obviously this does not affect tobacco products only; it is also an important issue for the market of alcoholic beverages, due to the disorganisation of the Romanian market and the transitional exemption."
"The irregularities in the management of EU finances to the tune of millions or even billions of euros exposed by Mr Herbert Bösch in his report have been a disappointment."
"In this context, I would like to reiterate that the report deals with the year 2004, and hence irregularities in the new Member States accounted for but a fraction of the mismanaged amounts."
"Thus, there is all the more reason for us to regard these revelations as a challenge."
"If the old Member States with their long-term experience have not been able to ensure adequate transparency in dealing with EU public funds, there is no doubt that similar deficiencies can be anticipated in the new Member States."
"Extremely disconcerting are the reported data on the quantities and value of smuggled cigarettes and branded counterfeit products, resulting in major financial losses to the Community."
"The European Union’s eastern frontier is most vulnerable in this regard, especially in the stretch where Slovakia and Poland border on Ukraine and where Poland borders on Belarus."
"I therefore urge that greater attention be paid to the protection of those regions and to thwarting illegal trafficking."
"By the same token, I would like to point out that the regions in question are the poorest in the European Union and that the extent of smuggling is indirectly related to their economic situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, losses and irregularities affecting Structural Funds have increased dramatically during the period under consideration."
"In 2004 these increased by 44% over 2003, totalling almost EUR 700 million."
"This is both a warning and a challenge for us all."
"The challenge, on the one hand, is to take effective steps targeting the affected Member States and, on the other, to identify systemic solutions that would safeguard the Community’s financial interests against fraud and other forms of illegal activity."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Bösch for a fine report."
"The report represents work of a very high quality, as is always the case when Mr Bösch is involved."
"We are aware, unfortunately, that the EU has a problem of legitimacy."
"The EU has an image problem when it comes to how it administers taxpayers' money."
"This problem is the result of two facts."
"The first of these is the simple fact that fraud involving EU funds does take place."
"The other is that there is not enough transparency."
"Clearly, this sets a number of challenges for the institutions – the European Parliament, OLAF and the other EU institutions."
"Firstly, what is of course needed to solve the problems that exist is, quite simply, better monitoring."
"Secondly, the situation calls for greater transparency."
"I recently read an article in a Danish newspaper bearing the headline ‘Everyone is talking about transparency, but no one is doing anything about it’."
"I believe that, unfortunately, this article was truly symptomatic of the view that the European people have of Europe."
"Everyone talks about transparency."
"We all want transparency, but we do nothing about it."
"Fortunately, something is happening."
"Fortunately, the Commission is currently in the process of taking an initiative whereby it is to be obligatory to publish the names of those receiving agricultural subsidies."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"We would like the same principle also to apply to Structural Fund resources."
"It should, of course, be the case that every journalist, every citizen and everyone else can log on to a website very easily and very simply and see the names of those receiving the Union’s money."
"More also needs to be done, however, in relation to monitoring."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament acknowledge that the integrated financial control system works well, but we do believe, at the same time, that it is a problem that the system has still not been fully implemented, more than seven years after the date by which it was supposed to have been implemented."
"The same applies to resources from the Structural Funds, where there is likewise a lack of satisfactory monitoring."
"It is very easy to forget such things when discussing the great developments of European cooperation."
"For example, are we to have a Constitutional Treaty?"
"Is Turkey to join?"
"Yet the truth is that these questions are incredibly important in terms of achieving legitimacy in the eyes of the people of Europe."
"For purely idealistic reasons, too, we should of course be working to ensure that every single euro paid by European taxpayers is responsibly administered and to ensure that this is done in a transparent manner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my great appreciation for the debate that has just taken place, as it relates to matters of exceptional importance."
"It is unquestionably true that the credibility of the European Union depends to a large extent on how reliably and effectively European financial resources are used."
"The report clearly marks a step towards the better and more effective use of resources and towards reducing the risk of misuse of these latter or of financial fraud."
"Allow me to take up just a few points that were raised in the discussion."
"There were some expressions of concern that the independence of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) might be undermined."
"I have to say that the opposite is true in respect of the Commission proposals that have been presented for debate in Parliament."
"That risk will not arise, and I feel sure that our debate will be far-reaching and will show that the Commission proposals do not point towards any weakening of the independent position of OLAF."
"Similarly, the highly important question of procedural rights and procedural requirements was raised."
"Here too I can state that the Commission proposal is in line with the views expressed in the debate, namely that there is a need to reinforce some elements relating to, for example, the transfer of information on investigations, independence and operational confidentiality in such a way that the rights of those involved are respected, in accordance with the legal principles of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me also to touch briefly on the Eurostat problem."
"This case is still open, and until all of the proceedings have been completed it will not be possible to quantify the results precisely in the normal way, but this will be done as soon as the situation becomes clearer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to state the common interest of the Commission and Parliament in seeing that we progress further down a route that will ensure that Europe’s financial resources are used in an effective and wholly honest way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"It is my great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the South African Parliament is now seated in the gallery for official visitors."
"The South African delegation is headed by Mr Obed Bapela, President of the House."
"The delegation itself is composed of eight members, representing the country’s diverse political tendencies."
"This is the first time since 1998 that we have had the pleasure of welcoming our South African counterparts here, in Europe."
"South Africa and the European Union share the belief that international problems must be resolved by means of multilateral solutions."
"They also share common social and political values."
"Both are actively engaged in supporting peace and stability and in combating poverty throughout the whole continent of Africa."
"We hope at present to reinforce further the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation."
"I have been informed that your meetings at the European Parliament have been crowned with success."
"I hope that you pursue your mission successfully, and I also wish you a safe journey home."
"The next item is voting time."
"– () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to add the item ‘hydrogen and fuel cells’ to the activities of ‘renewable energies’ and ‘energy efficiency’."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their excellent and fruitful cooperation."
"We had 1700 amendments, so the interest in the Seventh Framework Programme was huge."
"I would particularly like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who put in the most work."
"Cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs was excellent, and I should like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation."
"The Commission officials and political group advisors also put in a lot of work."
"Thanks to the Seventh Framework Programme, we want to exploit the potential of all the 25 European Union Member States."
"We want to take advantage of the experience of the best people and infrastructure."
"The European Parliament has acted quickly, effectively and responsibly."
"We must not slow down the pace."
"We must launch the programme on 1 January 2007, and this is my call to you."
"Mr President, we note that there is a problem on the voting list: it suggests that, if Amendment 91 is adopted, Amendment 12 lapses, when in reality they are two complementary amendments, an a) and a b)."
"In other words, 12 does not lapse, but 91 is adopted or not adopted, and then we vote on 12."
"I was going to announce precisely that to you, honourable Members, when the time came to vote on Article 2."
"In fact, contrary to what it says in your voting lists, Amendment 12 does not fall."
"We shall attend to this in due course."
"– () Mr President, Tunisia has in fact received sustained attention from this House, but above and beyond condemnation, we can play a conciliatory role."
"This is the sense of the oral amendment that follows paragraph 3 and that I will now read out to you: ‘The European Parliament invites all parties interested in the future of the Tunisian League of Human Rights to renew their dialogue in order to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone.’"
"If by any chance any fellow Members reject this amendment being put to the vote, I would urge my colleagues to abstain from voting on this resolution, since it would be imbalanced."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, even though you made some jokey remarks about this MIFID arriving in the European Parliament, I should like to say that it is not just a technical issue that we are adopting today."
"This is the first time Parliament has really increased its powers when it comes to delegated legislation in the field of comitology."
"We have been trying to get more powers when we are dealing with delegated legislation on comitology."
"It was a disgrace for Parliament that the issue was debated as the last item on yesterday’s agenda."
"Getting those powers was a historic moment for the European Parliament."
"We have to fight strongly for those powers, especially now, when we are renegotiating the comitology agreement and interinstitutional agreement."
"I know that every political group backs these extra powers for the European Parliament."
"It is not a technical issue."
"These issues should be dealt with during the day, not at midnight."
"I share your opinion, Mrs Kauppi, especially since I was the Vice-President in charge of holding the gavel yesterday evening at midnight when this debate took place."
"I am therefore aware of the importance of this matter."
"Indeed, this is a historic moment: the completion of the Lamfalussy process for the first time by this House."
"Mr President, I should like to move an oral amendment, which should be indicated in colleagues’ voting lists."
"I have secured the agreement of all the major groups and hope it will be voted through."
"If that is indeed the case we do not need a split vote."
"The amendment would read as follows:"
"‘Considers that sustainable development should be seen more as an economic opportunity than as a constraint, and as a spur to technological innovation investment; Calls, therefore, upon the Commission to ensure effective coordination of the Union's growth strategies, integrating information and communications technologies and resource-efficient technologies for sustainable development and “smart growth” both at home and abroad.’"
"I hope the House can accept this."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"– () Mr President, I would in fact like to propose a simple structural change to paragraph 2, in order to render it more balanced and thereby to give it more force."
"At the moment we have a general introductory phrase followed by a list of examples."
"I propose removing the second part of the sixth indent and adding it to the introductory phrase, so that the call to punish those responsible applies to all the national authorities."
"I also propose adding the word ‘hate’ to paragraph 2, which would give, and I shall read out the beginning to you: ‘strongly condemns all racist and hate attacks and urges all national authorities to do everything in their power to punish those responsible and to fight the climate of impunity with respect to such issues’ and so on."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, between ‘gay pride’ and ‘parade’, we propose to insert ‘equality’, as in the official title of the parade."
"So the wording would be ‘the gay pride equality parade’."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, in recital B we propose to insert the words ‘and anti-gypsyism’ after the word ‘homophobia’."
"Is there any opposition to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"– Mr President, in fact, in order to be consistent with one of the amendments that we have adopted, the oral amendment consists of adding Spain to the list of countries where there have recently been serious cases of violence, of violations of rights on racist and xenophobic grounds."
"This is the reason for the oral amendment and the reason for incorporating it."
"I would therefore insist, also in order to be consistent with what we have said: it is not a question of condemning a country, but rather an event that has taken place in a country and which has happened recently."
"Is there any opposition to adding Spain to the list of those countries mentioned?"
"Mr President, I must insist."
"In fact, we were not against the proposing of an oral amendment, but we did want to vote against this oral amendment."
"This is different, it seems to me – but let us drop the matter."
"I do not know if my explanations will be as clear as yours, Mrs Roure, but our Rules of Procedure are very clear."
"As soon as a Member proposes an oral amendment, if thirty-seven other Members rise to oppose it, then it is not included."
"It is as simple as that."
"I would point out that, at its meeting yesterday, the Conference of Presidents decided to authorise the modification of the title of this report as follows: ‘Inshore fishing and the problems encountered by inshore fishing communities’."
"We have now finished voting."
"The aim of this report is to aid those involved in the sector and to enable them to have the opportunity to run their businesses more smoothly and concentrate their efforts on the direct running of their operations."
"This applies especially to medium and small enterprises."
"This will in no small way simplify legislation and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy."
"I am sure that Member States will also welcome this proposal, as it will significantly reduce their work load."
"This proposal has acknowledged the fact that all the countries that have an active fisheries sector have different structures and consequently different needs."
"We will be in a position to ensure a coordinated collation of data, and furthermore this data will be made readily available to all involved."
"I agree with the rapporteur that a cost effectiveness analysis of the system should be introduced, together with reports on best practices for lessening the workload for national authorities, thereby enhancing the usefulness and quality of the data."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am greatly disappointed by the European Parliament’s stance on ethical issues."
"In particular, I disagree with the funding of research using live human embryos for reproduction purposes – this is prohibited in some Member States and contravenes the protection of human life and dignity from conception to natural death."
"Despite these reservations, I have voted for the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme, as I realise how important it is for the future of Europe and Europe’s bid to become the most competitive global economy."
"I regard this Programme as something like a guide to the Lisbon Strategy."
"It gives me hope that allocations for R[amp]D will help Europe retain its research brainpower and that it will be put to use to develop high-quality projects aiming to improve EU citizens’ quality of life in the environment, transport, energy and healthcare sectors."
"Allow me to use my own country as an example."
"Slovakia is relying on the Seventh Framework Programme, among other things, to complete the construction and deployment of a Cyclotron Therapy Centre."
"This facility will be used to treat various forms of cancer with in-depth proton irradiation, which happens to be far less invasive than conventional radiotherapy."
"To date, more than 40 thousand patients have been treated using this highly effective state-of-the-art therapeutic technique."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the European citizens and the researchers on the approval of the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I believe that it offers hope to everybody who believes in basic research, with the creation of the European Research Council, and in the most advanced pioneering research, despite all of the risks it involves."
"I also believe that it offers support to small- and medium-sized businesses and also hope to everybody who depends on research in the field of health, something on which great emphasis has been placed and for which the budget in this programme has been increased, and furthermore with the support of the all of the political parties."
"I believe that we are in a situation of hope."
"We must now encourage researchers to join the project, urge the universities and the regions to join in this common task, so that we can thereby work together to benefit everybody."
"Furthermore, it is a much more flexible and open programme than previous ones and it has enthusiastically introduced the humanities, historical heritage and other aspects of culture."
"Congratulations to everybody."
"Mr President, a broad – practically unanimous – consensus was reached by this House this morning on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"As we know, Europe is making a significant economic effort in line with the Lisbon Strategy."
"My fellow Members will have noted the breadth of the debate stirred up by Article 6 on bioethics, in relation to which the compromise amendment tabled by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was accepted by a margin of little more than 40 votes, which is certainly a substantial, but not a majority, margin."
"At the same time, more stringent amendments on this subject, such as, for example, the amendment tabled by Mrs Niebler on stem cells, which seemed more reasonable to some of us, were rejected by less than 20 votes."
"The Italian delegation from the Margherita party supported these amendments."
"With this explanation of vote, I intend to highlight the fact that the intense debate stirred up by an issue that, in reality, involves less than 1% of our resources should prompt Parliament and the Commission to adopt the precautionary principle, so as not to underestimate the impact of this matter on public opinion, to which we refer when we seek consensus for Europe."
"– Mr President, I would like to state in the clearest possible terms that the members of the Austrian People’s Party support the clear stance adopted by the Federal Government on the Euratom issue, and that their voting is in keeping with the result of the public referendum in Austria."
"I regret the fact that Mrs Niebler’s proposal on the ethical issues was rejected."
"The Austrian People’s Party delegation declares itself clearly opposed to destructive embryo research."
"– Mr President, in my opinion, the nuclear lobby is attempting to worm out further billions for nuclear energy projects by means of untenable promises of a clean, safe and environmentally-friendly energy solution and by withholding the true costs."
"Nuclear research budgets are seven to eight times greater than the amount of money spent on renewable energies and renewable energy sources."
"If the actual costs – for example, those relating to the disposal of nuclear waste and the consequential costs of possible radioactive contamination – are included, it would become clear that nuclear energy is not only extremely dangerous but also unprofitable."
"In my opinion, no new money should be allocated to nuclear energy."
"Instead, this money should be given to extend renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency."
"– Mr President, as a staunch opponent of nuclear technology and energy production from nuclear technology, it was natural for me to vote against the Buzek report at the end."
"I also wanted to vote against Amendment 24 but had the impression that the voting device was not working."
"I would therefore like to reiterate that I voted against Amendment 24."
"I used my vote to endorse Amendments 354 and 352 as a means of opposing funding of research activities aimed at the cloning of human embryos."
"The proposal from the Committee diminished the safeguards in the original Commission proposal by allowing the funding of research on so-called supernumerary embryos, with no prohibition on funding activities which would be contrary to the Oviedo Convention (i.e. cloning for research and germ-line intervention)."
"I also strongly hold that national standards and legislation must not be overridden or diluted by EU activities, including EU-funded research."
". The European Parliament’s decision at first reading is a disaster."
"Parliament has not succeeded in setting the EU Commission clear, ethical limits regarding research policy."
"The close nature of the vote result gives cause for hope, however, that this can be rectified in Council and at second reading."
"It is a sign of inadequacy that Parliament has not used the opportunity to support ethically straightforward and very promising alternatives."
"It is unacceptable to lower human embryos to the level of raw material."
"There is the risk of the commercialisation of human life and the orchestration of women for the purpose of egg donation."
"Moreover, the funding of research into embryonic stem cells could undermine trust in the EU if values such as human dignity and human rights are so obviously subordinated to financial interests."
"It would be outrageous to continue to expect German taxpayers to finance projects prohibited under German law."
"Already in the current Sixth Framework Programme, six projects are being funded, in contravention of promises made to the European Parliament, which do not comply with German legislation."
"The Council is now on the ball in terms of correcting this precarious ethical situation."
"The Federal German Government must make it clear that it contradicts the principle of subsidiarity and that it is very problematic to cofinance research funding of this nature which is ethically highly emotive, and which is not in accord with Germany’s legal position."
"I endorse the call set out in the Buzek report for the continuation of the INTAS programme and for its activities to be funded from the specific ‘Cooperation’, ‘People’ and ‘Capacities’ programmes."
"INTAS is the only pan-European, EU-funded programme dedicated to scientific cooperation with the NIS countries, including involving the scientific community in Ireland and Northern Ireland."
"It should be continued."
"The Research and Training Networks should also be continued, particularly the flexible support they have given under FP5 and FP6 to a positive mix of both ‘early-stage researchers’ and ‘experienced researchers’."
"Early-stage researchers benefit greatly from the practical support and advice from more experienced researchers."
"Mobility of researchers also tends to be high when there is a mix of such researchers."
"This approach should also be continued."
". () The growth and competitiveness of the Union depend in great measure on its ability to develop research and innovation."
"In 2000 in Lisbon, the Heads of State or Government promised to promote a knowledge-based Europe and, from 2010, to set aside 3% of GNI for this."
"Mr Buzek’s report – that I voted for on Thursday – emphasises the objectives and the challenges of the Seventh Framework Programme for RTD."
"Two chapters stand out in particular in my mind, concerning regional development: the Regions of Knowledge and the support for SMEs."
"It is necessary to reinforce the research potential of regions of the Union by encouraging regional research clusters that link universities, research centres, businesses and regional authorities."
"The report also recommends reinforcing the innovation capacity of SMEs by encouraging them to join networks and by facilitating their access to the Framework Programme."
"In this way the report aims at making research a genuine tool for regional development, even if it is deplorable that the resources allocated to this great European ambition have been reduced by the slimming course that the financial perspectives have undergone."
"I voted in favour of the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (2007 to 2013). I feel that investment in research and technological development is vital to the success of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Investment in research into climate change and its impact on natural disasters and into energy sources other than fossil fuels must be stepped up."
"I feel that research into embryonic stem cell research – a highly promising area of research that has yielded very encouraging results in terms of treating diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s – should be funded by this Framework Programme following rigorous, case-by-case assessment by the ethical committees."
". I voted for this report."
"The future of Europe depends on high tech, high skill, high value-added jobs."
"These will be generated by high levels of research and development spending close to the market."
"The money available is better but still inadequate, particularly in view of the bizarre wastage of the CAP, where Europe's cows live on more, with two dollars per day, than do 700 million Chinese."
"I also welcome the passing of Committee Amendment 66, which will allow funding for stem cell research where it is approved by Member State law and subject to strict controls."
"We all know people whose lives could be transformed on the basis of stem cell research."
"I neither wish to deprive them of the political benefits nor drive the research from Europe to the Far East"
". I believe that this document is one of the most important in this legislative period, as it addresses the fundamental issue of funding for research projects relating to technological development in a number of different areas of activity."
"In the section on fisheries, I warmly welcome the amendments aimed at providing greater independence in the approach to the sector. Given the crisis facing the sector, these amendments are a positive step."
"Only with more and better technology will it be possible to bring profitability and competitiveness to Europe’s fisheries sector."
"I wish to lend my unequivocal backing to the establishment of a separate heading for fisheries, sustained exploitation of the oceans under the Seventh Framework Programme, and all of the other measures contained in the report."
"() For obvious ethical reasons, human cloning must be completely banned."
"We cannot allow any remaining doubts on this matter."
"Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme and certain amendments proposed to us today do foster doubt, by only excluding cloning for reproductive purposes from Community funding, and not excluding cloning for therapeutic purposes."
"This semi-legitimation is dangerous."
"It is based on the idea that a human being, if not yet developed, may be considered as a simple material, and this is unacceptable."
"What is more, this Programme also provides for the possibility of funding research on embryonic stem cells."
"I know, although I do not approve of it, that certain Member States of the European Union authorise this."
"It is inappropriate, in the context of a vote on research funding, to make pronouncements on the legislation of Member States."
"However, countries that forbid these practices should not be forced to finance them using Community funds, and this type of research should, therefore, not benefit from the resources of the Seventh Framework Programme for RTD."
"This is why we have voted against these provisions, reserving our approval for other research programmes mentioned in the report."
"When we adopt positions on various issues, we must always reflect on whether such matters really should be decided on at EU level, rather than do as we have done in this case and ponder how the EU is to carry through the research that a particular establishment wants to see take place."
"No more money is made available for research just because the Member States send such money via EU authorities."
"What there is, however, is more bureaucracy and increased costs."
"Institutional competition between countries with a view to discovering sound solutions leads to quicker progress than does central control at higher levels."
"The question that should instead have been posed is that of what the EU can do for research in Europe that the Member States themselves cannot successfully do."
"In theory, EU involvement may be limited to areas such as research networks, freedom of movement for researchers within the EU and large-scale research in areas such as energy derived from fusion."
"Those are the kinds of area to which the EU’s research policy should be limited in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Thus, we cannot support stem cell research at Community level since it may mean Member States being forced to help fund research that conflicts with national laws in this area."
"We would, however, point out that we are keen supporters of the laws and rules that apply in Sweden to this type of research."
"Because there has manifestly been no thinking in terms of subsidiarity, the June List has voted against the report as a whole."
". There is a contradiction in Parliament’s position on the Seventh Framework Programme for 2007-2013 in terms of some of the rhetoric surrounding it and of its level of funding."
"Although the EU purports to be a society geared towards ‘knowledge, research and technology’ there has in fact been a reduction of some EUR 21 million in EU budgetary funding for implementing these objectives in relation to the Commission’s original proposal."
"I also wish to point out that, in the context of the priorities of this Seventh Framework Programme, attempts have been made to view research as yet another ‘product’ to be put on the market, a highly profitable one at that."
"In other words, in the context of this Seventh Framework Programme we are facing an attempt to commercialise research, to the detriment of public research."
"Although there are positive points raised in the proposal before us today, we feel the priorities of such an important instrument should also include public research in the social, environmental, education and health areas."
"We are therefore very disappointed with the rejection of a number of proposals aimed at safety at work and the prevention of work-related diseases, and the use of ICTs for sustainable development and social and economic inclusion."
"Hence our vote against."
"I totally oppose research on human embryos."
"I voted for the Gargani/Záborská amendments."
"These amendments were defeated."
"Because I believed it served the greater good, I then voted for Mrs Niebler’s amendments as recommended by Mr Gargani (and leading Christian organisations)."
"I did so in the belief that this would have restricted research to stem cells extracted from the human embryo (i.e. the embryo has already been destroyed) prior to 31.12.2003 and that new human embryos could not be created and then destroyed for research purposes."
"I did so in particular because the other two sets of amendments (Committee and Purvis) would be next to be voted on and seemed likely at that stage to be carried."
"This is the most unacceptable position for me."
"As both the Gargani and Niebler amendments were defeated, the next amendment (Committee) was passed as I feared."
"I voted against this."
"I am not at ease with voting for Niebler but it is a better ethical position than creating new embryos for destruction."
"Killing someone to take their liver for research is murder."
"Taking the liver of someone already dead for research is different but still raises huge moral/ethical questions."
"."
"In the EU’s Seventh Research Framework Programme, security and defence research is established as a separate budget item for the first time."
"Starting from 2007, the EU will undertake massive investment in these problematic research areas."
"Parts of the research budget allocation will still be coordinated with the European Defence Agency (EDA)."
"Defence companies such as EADS and BAE Systems will be able to have a decisive say in how funds are used."
"On the one hand, defence research is designed to establish weapons technology as the leading technology within the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the other, by means of the massive investment in defence research, a further milestone is achieved in the establishment of the EU rapid reaction corps and EU battle groups."
"Moreover, space research has taken on a military bias."
"Hence, GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), which was openly established with a view to enabling the European Union to observe its strategic role, is to be funded."
"History teaches us that rising defence expenditure and, hence, increased funding for defence research, too, is always a sign of further wars and conflicts."
"Contrary to all assurances of surgically precise weaponry, the number of war victims and, above all, the proportion of civilian victims of war, have always risen the more technically advanced the weaponry."
". The Community’s research and development framework programme is of pressing importance as it is one of the programmes with the highest EU funding."
"Divided into four specific programmes – Cooperation, People, Ideas and Capacities – this framework programme will serve to boost European competitiveness and innovation."
"Of these specific programmes, I should like to highlight the 'Capacities’ component, which will enjoy the highest budget and which plans to involve industry in the research and development of new products and in promoting cooperation with research centres and universities."
"The report also attaches due importance to SMEs, whose involvement is facilitated in this new framework programme by the support role given to technology platforms."
"Lastly, the importance of this programme in the context of regional development comes to the fore, insofar as it provides for involvement with the Structural Funds and refers to the need to take account of the ‘Convergence’ objective regions, which covers almost all of Portuguese territory, when awarding funding. It also provides for local and regional authorities to be involved in the decision-making process as regards the granting of funding for building new infrastructure."
". I voted for Amendments 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357 by Gargani, Záborská et al because they disallow EU funding for human embryonic stem cell research, leaving it up to the Member States to fund from their national budget if they so decide."
"These amendments acknowledge the exploitative and ethically controversial nature of embryonic procurement and research and recognise that in order to fully respect the subsidiarity principle, EU funds should not be distributed to research that is illegal in various Member States."
"Nevertheless, these amendments encourage research on other promising and non-controversial stem cell research such as adult and cord blood."
"These amendments have already been approved by the JURI and FEMM Committees."
"When the Gargani amendments failed to pass, I voted in favour of Amendments 319 and 358 by Niebler et al as a damage-control exercise."
"These amendments allow EU funding for unethical use of existing embryonic stem cell lines created before 31 December 2003."
"This is a compromise amendment."
"It is an attempt at damage control because it removes the incentive to create new embryos for research and would hinder any progression to cloning."
". I am pleased to have voted in favour of including stem cell research, among other things, in this report."
"Scientific research can mean real progress against chronic conditions unreachable by traditional scientific approaches."
"Anyone who has lived with relatives who suffer from debilitating and chronic conditions hopes for progress in treatment."
"I know from my own personal experience with family members that this vote today can alter the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the EU."
"There is, on an alternative issue, a growing need to link some businesses with the research programmes."
"Too little effort is still being made to accommodate such businesses – more must be done."
"() Aside from the disappointment caused by the decrease in resources, the vote on this report is essential and is a beacon of hope for the world of research, and also for those sufferers who long for progress to be made in such research."
"I would like to denounce the obscurantism of certain conservatives who reject embryo research, despite the fact that it is a source of so much hope."
"In fact, cutting-edge research in this precise sector has already led to great progress in our knowledge of diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease."
"Happily, Amendments 352, 354, 319, 356, 357 and 358 by Mr Gargani, Mrs Niebler and Mrs Záborská have been rejected."
"However, it is very clear that research on embryonic stem cells must take place under very strict ethical conditions."
"Finally, I would like to particularly salute – apart from the rapporteur, Mr Buzek – my colleague and head of the Belgian Socialist delegation, Mr Busquin, who, maintaining the dynamism of his impressive work as European Commissioner for Research, continues to work tirelessly to promote research in the heart of our parliamentary district."
". – I voted in favour of this new FPRD because we are substantially improving the Commission’s proposal and adopting a more ambitious stance than the Council."
"With a budget to match our ambition – over EUR 50 billion, in other words three times what it was before – we are providing sufficient resources for our researchers to remain in Europe and to attract researchers from third countries."
"With the Seventh Framework Programme, and its four specific programmes, it will be possible to structure the European research area around ten main themes."
"I also supported the creation of a specific security heading, since this is an issue that remains a priority for our citizens."
"I also welcome the fact that my amendments under the health heading were mostly adopted."
"This programme also includes a number of new features, such as joint technology initiatives, which will make it possible to associate businesses, especially the smallest businesses, with research centres in a particular sector."
"Our ambition is therefore also to relaunch innovation in Europe and thereby to support our businesses and our jobs."
". – I respect the national legislation of my country, Slovakia, the will of my constituents and my own personal conscience."
"This is why I did not support the legislative resolution."
"Respect for human life and for the integrity of women is sacrosanct."
"It is irresponsible to provide Research Framework Programme funding for projects that exploit women’s ova or that destroy the human embryo."
"The Framework Programme funds research that is banned in several Member States, including Slovakia, with Slovak taxpayers’ money."
"Is it not a lie to pretend that the EU, and in particular the Commission, respects the diversity and sovereignty of the Member States when it is prepared to fund illegal projects?"
"Whilst the Community budget is short of meeting our daily needs, why throw taxpayers’ money down the drain on research that will never have any tangible benefit?"
"This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am a Member, have called for an end to the funding or cofinancing of research that is illegal in some Member States or that involves destroying human embryos, human cloning, the exploitation of women to obtain their ova, the manipulation of germ lines for the purpose of eugenics and the creation of hybrid cells such as chimeras."
"British Conservatives support the principle of a common approach to civil aviation security across the EU."
"However, we could not support any extension of Commission competence, which could frustrate the overwhelming case for Member States to determine when there is a need for heightened security measures in their own territories."
"Neither could we support the extension of the scope of this regulation to in-flight security, nor the extension on competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency, at least until it has proven its ability to operate its current safety functions in a competent and efficient manner."
"For these reasons, Conservatives abstained on the final vote."
"I voted in favour of those amendments that were designed to protect the interests of my constituents in Gibraltar."
"It is outrageous that common rules in the field of civil aviation security do not automatically apply to Gibraltar because of the ongoing refusal by Spain to recognise Gibraltar as a full part of the European Union."
"This continued harassment only entrenches, understandably, hard-line views in Gibraltar."
"I would recommend that any long-term solution is more likely to follow from carrots and not sticks."
". I would like to use my explanation of vote to justify my abstention during the vote on Amendments 90 and 91."
"It should not be the case that the application of rules in the field of civil aviation security is adopted in the first instance for all airports located in Member State sovereign territories while Gibraltar airport is exempted from this regulation in a rider."
"How can we talk about a Union when generally applicable laws suddenly no longer apply to certain territories?"
"Both Spain and the United Kingdom belong to the European Union."
"I would like to say that squabbles of this nature should not be dealt with on the back of the European Union nor, in particular, at the expense of civil aviation security, which this report deals with, and which should apply its measures and rules to prevent acts of unlawful interference in relation to civil aviation to all EU airports so as to safeguard the welfare of all passengers."
"I very much welcome the proposal on the table today for common rules in the field of civil aviation."
"I think it is timely after the security experience gained in the aftermath of September 11th that basic principles can be legally set in stone as to what has to be done in order to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference."
"All Member States need to be singing from the same hymn sheet regarding common rules on security checks, searches, surveillance, prohibited items and security patrols, to name just a few."
"I support the innovative approach taken by the Commission in proposing rules that will cover security measures during flights."
"However, I am less supportive of amendments put forward to this proposal which call for the compulsory use of armed in-flight security officers or ‘sky marshals’."
"I believe it is important that Member States are not legally bound to deploy or accept armed in-flight security officers on domestic or foreign aircraft."
"– This morning, Parliament voted for the Costa report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"As the holiday season approaches, when millions of passengers get ready to board planes for their dream destinations – some 16 million per year from Brussels National Airport – I feel it is opportune to highlight certain crucial security rules on board aircraft."
"Whilst some people may grumble about having to observe stringent controls, I would say that this is the price that must be paid."
"The general flow may suffer, but ultimately this will be to everyone's benefit in security terms."
"This report is a series of revisions of a 2002 law that was adopted in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001."
"All rhetoric about security should focus on the basic standards governing controls, surveillance, prohibited articles and security agents on board aircraft."
"There is one sole objective, namely greater consistency in the policies aimed at ‘one-stop security’ throughout the EU."
"– Slovenia fulfils the Maastricht criteria, which Mr Prodi himself recently described as stupid."
"As such, the country may adopt the single currency, having applied to do so."
"It will in fact be the only country in the euro zone to fulfil these famous criteria."
"Our abstention on this issue is not a rejection of Slovenia’s application."
"We will not be voting against Slovenia’s application if that is what the country, and more importantly its people, actually want."
"We cannot, however, accept the entry of a new country into the least dynamic economic area in the world, which is saddled with a monetary policy that is destroying our already weak growth and with an exchange-rate policy that is harmful by its absence."
"Adopting the euro is not a good idea."
"As Frenchmen we know this."
"France has done so and is paying a high price."
"We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on this report."
"It is up to the Slovenians to decide, preferably through a referendum, whether they want their country to participate in EMU."
"Nor do we recommend other countries to do so. However, it is, as I say, up to the people of each country to decide on the issue."
"Mr President, with regard to the pattern of my voting on the resolutions on Tunisia, I should like to state that I voted through loyalty to my party."
"However, I believe we should not have two sets of weights and measures, in the sense that when voting on a number of resolutions over a short period of time that are directed against a particular country, perhaps one should either tone down the rate of resolutions and condemnation or use the same weights and balances as for other countries."
"Regarding this motion for a resolution, our PPE-DE Group abstained, because it believes that the resolution was unnecessary, and that it does not treat Tunisia fairly."
"I would like to remind you that this is the fourth time in the space of a few months that we are singling out Tunisia, whilst there are several other countries where the situation is much worse and about which we have said nothing."
"We thus abstained because whereas we agree that Tunisia still has a lot to do in order to improve its human rights record, we feel that the message we should be sending to this country needs to be constructive, and not in the form of a 'witch hunt'."
"Of equal significance is the fact that whilst the resolution was passed, we had a majority in the room which either abstained or voted against."
"Thus, the effect of this resolution is certainly doubtful."
"We support the joint motion for a resolution from the centre-left groups, in spite of the fact that it really is the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg that should monitor, both politically and legally, whether all the European states without exception comply with the UN Declaration on Human Rights."
"The Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights are the institutions that should be involved in these cases, especially, for example, with a view to ensuring that it is possible for Gay Pride’s democratic freedom to be upheld in Russia."
"It is difficult to draw up a complete list of violent incidents of various kinds that have taken place in different parts of Europe and that have been motivated by racism or homophobia."
"There are, however, powerful reasons for taking this opportunity to condemn all known statements, as well as expressions of violence, that are to be explained in terms of underlying racism or homophobia."
". We strongly believe that environmental policy could present a significant economic opportunity for large-scale direct and indirect job creation, provided that innovation and industrial policies focus on promoting sustainable development."
"Accordingly, there needs to be a macroeconomic framework that supports each country’s sustainable development, strengthening employment, social cohesion and the environment."
"The ongoing neoliberal policies, however, run counter to these objectives."
"The ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and the EU’s monetary and fiscal policies have had a detrimental impact on economic growth, employment and the environment."
"We wish to draw attention to the fact that the EU still has high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality."
"We therefore believe that the fight against income inequality and the promotion of genuine convergence should feature among the priorities of the economic and social agenda."
"British Conservatives support the objectives behind the Sustainable Development Strategy but believe that this resolution is unduly negative as to the progress that is being made."
"The European Parliament must recognise that sustainable economic growth is a prerequisite and a catalyst for sustainable development, rather than being a threat or alternative to it."
"We welcome the focus that is being placed on meeting our international obligations but believe that the time has come to focus on enforcing and monitoring existing targets and regulation, rather than creating a never-ending stream of legislation that is enforced – at best – inconsistently."
"Failure to meet the environmental targets that we have already agreed to would fundamentally undermine Europe’s credibility in the area of sustainable development."
". I welcome today's very positive vote and hope that its contents will not be forgotten when we come to look at our policies on growth in the future: the emphasis on quality and the decoupling of growth from resource use are very important points."
"I also welcome the willingness of the Austrian Presidency to listen to the points made in our deliberations in preparing this resolution."
"They have made an historic step in their proposal to Council in taking up the need to develop a better training strategy, albeit only in certain sectors at present, to equip the construction sector, architects, etc. with the necessary skills to work in an environmentally positive way."
"This is something I have been urging the Commission to take on board for some time and I hope for a positive response."
"We cannot meet our climate change targets if we do not have a workforce with the necessary skills to deliver."
"I also welcome the recognition that social cohesion is a necessary part of sustainable development: the poorest people often live and work in the worst environmental circumstances, whether in the EU or Africa."
"Our policies must deliver for everyone."
". – As well as being an ecological necessity, environmental protection is also an economic necessity."
"Great civilisations such as the Maya in Central America disappeared because they destroyed their natural resources."
"In the 20th century, the most destructive system was communism, which not only killed tens of millions of human beings, but also laid waste to the environment."
"Examples of this include nuclear power stations on the basis of the Chernobyl model and the drying up of the Aral Sea."
"At the moment, the country that is polluting the world most is communist China."
"In Europe, there are two prevailing ideologies in Brussels that are threatening the development of our countries. One is the doctrine of free trade, which is destroying our industrial fabric and which led to the Lisbon Strategy in 2000, and the other is Malthusianism, which has led on the one hand to the destruction of our vines and to our most fertile land being left fallow, and on the other to our demographic decline."
"The replacement of missing children with calls for immigration and the relocation of our factories do not represent a solution."
"The real prerequisites for the genuinely sustainable development of our nations are the reinstatement of our borders and a major policy on the family."
"Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution because I felt that the attempt made to compare racism with homophobia was unacceptable."
"There is no need to point out the horrors of racial discrimination, which is thought through long before it is actually carried out."
"It is right to condemn every act of mockery and violence towards people of different sexual orientations, but we certainly cannot regard the institutions’ and the Churches’ outlook as inhuman when they defend the family as a structure of great importance for the common good insofar as it is based on the distinction between the sexes and on the coming together of a man and a woman, that is to say, on heterosexuality."
"This defence is laid down precisely by the human rights doctrine."
"Let us not forget Article 16 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights – a document whose secular nature is by no means in doubt – which proclaims the nuclear family as the essence of society and the State, a unit which, as such, must be acknowledged and protected."
"We must therefore not only stamp out racism and homophobia, but also reject a comparison of the two which, on closer inspection, constitutes an attempt to overturn a crucial aspect of human rights."
"Mr President, since I already explained in yesterday’s debate why this motion for a resolution strikes me as silly and undemocratic, I need not labour this point any further, and I already concur in advance with all the bad things Mr Claeys is about to say on this subject."
"All I would like to add today is that there is also another, sizeable category of very real victims of very real racism which nobody seems to be bothered about and in respect of whom this institution never lays down any resolutions."
"That is the category of very many native people who are no longer able to feel at home in their own street or their own town, and who become the victims of racist, anti-indigenous violence."
"Those are the older people and women who dare not go out after dark and who are terrorised on public transport."
"These people, however, are ignored by the politically correct, left-wing, fashionable opinion mafia, who – it is sad to say – monopolise the debates far too often in these institutions too."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the joint resolution by the other political groups."
"Unfortunately, the PPE-DE Group did not sign the joint resolution as a group. However, as individuals, many colleagues voted in favour of it."
"I think that fighting discrimination in all forms is a very important part of the work of an MEP."
"Even though the joint resolution had some ambiguities and was not 100% perfect, I can support it, based on the fact that it was reasonably balanced for this House."
"Mr President, I merely wish to say that I share Mrs Kauppi’s position exactly."
"As far as I was concerned, this was a motion for a resolution against racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia."
"I voted in favour because I feel it is an extremely important motion for a resolution."
"Last time, we had a joint motion for a resolution against homophobia on which all of the groups were in agreement."
"Unfortunately, I feel that the groundwork has not been properly prepared this time."
"Perhaps next time we will be able to achieve unanimity against homophobia in this Chamber."
"Mr President, I too voted against the motion for a resolution in this instance."
"Allow me to say a few words on it."
"Although xenophobia and discrimination are shameful things, I consider this to be a rather modish motion, of the kind that passes through our Chamber relatively often in various forms."
"I voted against it also because I do not think that in such a document there should be direct references to individual Member States and their governments or that they should be exhorted to follow different approaches, since everything rests in the hands of the voters who elected these governments."
"We should not be handing out marks to them."
"Paragraph 2 is clearly a list of very shameful acts, but I do not think that they represent a dominant current of opinion in Europe, and this was another reason why I voted against the motion."
"In paragraphs 4 and 5 I feel it is not appropriate, I repeat again, for the European Parliament to be involving itself, to my mind somewhat improperly, in the internal affairs of sovereign states such as Poland or Russia."
"In paragraph 11 there is again an explicit reference to Poland, and for this reason too I opposed the motion."
"Mr President, I have voted against the motion for a resolution on racist and homophobic violence because I find it unacceptable that a goal that is legitimate in itself should be contaminated by party-political considerations."
"There is, for example, recital E, where political parties are criticised for raising the failure of the multicultural model as an issue and for espousing the protection of national identities in Europe."
"Paragraph 11 is inspired by the inability of the Left to accept that right-wing parties win democratic elections and form governments."
"Paragraph 12, on the other hand, wants to generalise the typically Belgian system whereby parties are robbed of their funding when they denounce failing immigration policy."
"That is a threat to the right to the free expression of opinion, as is, in fact, recital K that aims to introduce censorship on the Internet."
"Nearly all the groups who tabled this motion for a resolution back Turkey’s accession to the European Union."
"They might want to take a look at what the situation is like over there when it comes to discrimination against minorities and homophobia."
"– Mr President, I too would like to take this opportunity to explain why I voted against this motion for a resolution against racist and homophobic violence."
"No sensible human being believes in racist or homophobic violence and everyone will condemn it wherever it actually exists."
"However, it seems to me that in this motion for a resolution, individuals who stand up for their own culture and national identity are all too quickly and easily suspected of racism."
"It also appears to me that individuals who stand up for the traditionally Christian, European image of the family are all too quickly suspected of possibly even welcoming homophobic violence."
"In my opinion, it is absolutely inadmissible when this is also then to be pinned onto individual EU Member States."
"Racist violence, alas, is now prevalent throughout Europe and must be vigorously addressed."
"I regret though that the resolution on this important subject was misused as a vehicle to attack internal government composition in Member States, which is the product of the democratic process and, frankly, beyond the remit of the European Parliament."
"Such drove me to vote against the resolution."
"In terms of the standards and ethics expected of democratic parties I very much regret that in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party has seen fit to invite into its Stormont Assembly Party the political representative of the UVF, an illegal organisation which has been mired in racist, sectarian and other violence."
"Such shameful association not only diminishes those who so taint themselves but undermines what should be a united stand by all democratic parties against criminality, whether of the racist or any other variety."
"In considering the issues raised in this report, it is necessary to make clear that whilst we are opposed to intolerance, we think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues."
". I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution against racism and homophobia, even though I warmly welcome the thrust of its content and I consider it politically timely."
"My objections – I abstained – revolve solely around the reference to a ‘case’ in Portugal, which is purportedly indicative of a serious culture of homophobia in Portugal."
"The Gisberta case, which took place in Oporto, was simply an act of juvenile delinquency, and was judged that way by Portuguese society."
"It was also properly dealt with by the legal authorities."
"There is therefore no reason whatsoever to include this case in such an important motion for a resolution, on an issue of such importance."
"As National Treasurer of the Anti-Nazi League in Britain and a member of the steering committee of Unite Against Fascism, I had the privilege of speaking at the recent 'Love Music, Hate Racism' event in Trafalgar Square to urge opposition to England's home-grown fascist party, the BNP, in the local elections."
"In my speech I warned again that there was a rising tide of racism in Europe."
"All too soon I have been proved right."
"We have racist and fascist parties in France and Italy, Belgium and Denmark that have been with us for some time."
"What is most worrying is the sudden regrowth of racism, homophobia and anti-Semitism in Poland, aided and abetted by fellow-travelling colleagues in the current Polish Government and European Parliament."
"All those opposed to racism in Europe must unite together against this new wave of hatred and intolerance."
". – The EU is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity."
"By coming together, the 25 Member States decided to uphold and to promote these values."
"The numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks that have taken place in recent times in Europe are therefore unacceptable and intolerable."
"It is crucial to condemn them publicly."
"This is why I drew up a resolution on behalf of my political group."
"In it, I have invited the EU institutions, the Member States and all the democratic political parties in Europe to condemn all acts of intolerance and incitement to hatred."
"We must remain vigilant, but must not lump everything together by listing examples of individual attacks perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments."
"What is more, the list of tragic examples contained in the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is not an exhaustive one."
"Let me make one thing clear: the fight against all forms of racism is not a matter of right or left."
"I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and for the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the other groups."
". Homophobia and racism have no place in Europe."
"Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community prohibits any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"Particularly following the scandalous and distressing events in Moscow which took place on the fringes of the Gay Pride rally in May 2006, it is imperative that we send a strong signal regarding tolerance in Europe."
"Last Saturday in Warsaw at the equality parade, I demonstrated against the increasing homophobic tendencies that are particularly prevalent in Poland, which is an EU Member State."
"The right of European citizens to sexual self-determination is a human right which is defended by us social democrats here in Parliament, whether in Warsaw, Riga or Frankfurt."
"I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution."
". – It was a mistake to mix racism and homophobia in the same text."
"There are paragraphs in this motion for a resolution that I cannot support, such as the one carrying accusations of police violence, and I reiterate my total opposition to homosexual adoption."
"It would be impossible to object to a text that vehemently condemns known acts of racism in Europe."
"Let us not forget our values, let us not forget why we made Europe."
"I am especially concerned at the increase in xenophobia that we have seen recently."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"Within the European Union, blatant racism is still widespread, and no group suffers more than the Roma."
"There have been many reported cases of verbal, emotional and physical attacks on the Roma, including several committed by police forces."
"Although this resolution fails to make sufficient mention of the Roma issue in particular, it is essential that Parliament work to conquer racism in all areas of Europe."
"I and my British Conservative colleagues abhor any actions by individuals, governments or political parties to incite racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia."
"Any person or organisation perpetrating or inciting such discrimination should be subject to the full force of the law."
"We believe in liberty and the rights of individuals to live their lives free from fear of persecution and prejudice."
"However, we were unable to support the joint motion for a resolution because it undermines the cause of tolerance by arbitrarily listing specific incidents and specific events and organisations."
"The motivation for the motion appears to be unnecessarily confrontational, rather than a genuine attempt to promote the cause of tolerance and non-discrimination."
"Consequently, we have abstained on the final vote."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats condemn racially motivated attacks, assaults and discrimination in every shape and form and firmly repudiate racist tendencies; that was stated in the motion for a resolution on homophobia that was adopted in January, and we have also spelled it out in our latest draft motion for a resolution."
"We call on the EU institution, the Member States and all political parties in the EU to do likewise."
"The joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not a document we can endorse, on the grounds that it arbitrarily pillories individual Member States and puts a motion for a resolution – a parliamentary instrument – in the service of false statements and insinuations."
"To name but two of these:"
"Paragraph 2 includes reference to: “the brutal assault on a German citizen of Ethiopian origin ... in particular because of its racial motive.”"
"The German Attorney-General, whose remit includes major crimes jeopardising the peace within Germany, sent this case back to the relevant court on the grounds that it was not primarily racially motivated."
"The draft motion for a resolution contains generalised presuppositions concerning the Member States’ police forces: ..."
"These people put their lives and limbs at risk, day in and day out, for the safety of all of us, and I refuse to lump them all together in this way and denounce them as racists."
"In considering the issues raised in this report it is necessary to make clear that whilst I am opposed to intolerance I do think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues."
"In addition it must be understood that Poland is a profoundly Catholic country and the people as a result will reflect their Catholic beliefs in exactly the same manner as Muslims reflect the Islamic view on homosexuality."
"It is rare that Parliament, if indeed ever, criticises Muslims for holding such views and it only reflects double standards if Catholics are to be treated differently."
"I welcome this resolution and was proud to vote for it."
"Yesterday's debate clearly illustrated how far we have still to go in establishing equality of respect within the EU."
"Many people have expressed their concern at the homophobic feelings voiced in Parliament’s Chamber."
"Fortunately, the vast majority of this House rejected these statements and has given a strong voice to criticism of at least two Member States and to racist acts in others."
"This is a welcome step."
"Politicians have a crucial role in establishing a climate that rejects violence and hate speech: it is part of establishing an inclusive society."
"As we are confronting politicians who promote prejudice, we must also do the same when this is done by the media and our institutions."
"We must face up to the human rights abuses in the EU."
"This positive vote today is part of that process."
". The Austrian People’s Party delegation, like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has, in all the resolutions on the subject both this year and in former years, taken a stand against racially motivated violence and xenophobia, as also against discrimination against homosexuals, and in favour of the highest standards in human rights and the outlawing of discrimination."
"It, too, therefore, has endorsed the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Gaubert on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"The ÖVP delegation has also, however, voted against the GUE/NGL, ALDE, Verts/ALE and PSE’s joint motion for a resolution on the grounds that these political groupings made no attempt to join with the PPE-DE group in fashioning a common text; another consideration is that there has been an inflation in this sort of motion for a resolution, and that this example of the genre is a purely political document characterized by many mistakes and generalizations, doing no more than using the themes of racism and intolerance as a pretext for sending out ideological messages."
"– All forms of human violence must be condemned."
"The inalienable right to life, freedom and security and respect for people’s dignity apply to every human being."
"National laws underpin these rights."
"To mix discourse on homosexual people and on racism discredits the promotion of human rights."
"Punishing all violations of these rights is the responsibility of each Member State and falls within the scope of the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Human Rights, which all Member States have signed. As such they are responsible to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"Is it the case that a new form of totalitarianism, which runs counter to democratically elected governments, is in the process of emerging?"
"Extremism is on the rise on both left and right, as the established parties merge with one another and accordingly lack the credibility and the political vision that is acceptable to families in the Member States."
"To reject the kind of manipulation and disinformation that is being peddled in this resolution is to fight against the emergence of extremism and violence, and to refuse to fan the flames of hate against the sections of society to which this resolution relates."
"This is why my group decided not to support the motion for a resolution."
". We are in favour of technological and digital solutions that will help to improve train signalling and protection, with a view to enhancing safety and eliminating traffic congestion on the rail network."
"Safety is particularly important in light of the substantial increase in the speed and capacity of railway lines."
"We have our doubts, however, as to whether the proposed system, ERTMS, is actually better than existing national systems."
"What it does deliver is greater cross-border interoperability, although it should be remembered that this proposal also forms part of the strategy of liberalising rail transport and of the internal market concept."
"The key question is how the additional costs of the new system for the rail companies will be funded."
"Who will bear these costs and how will the burden be spread among the Member States at a time of restricted Community budget?"
"The same thing has happened with the trans-European networks and the European programmes for transport policy, which have seen their funding reduced in the forthcoming financial framework."
"We also have our doubts about the condition that the Structural Funds for transport must be used solely for implementing this system."
"Hence our abstention."
". Traditional inshore fishing plays a key role in the local economy of a number of fishing communities."
"The lack of a regulatory framework applicable to the inshore sector has affected not only this sector but also the whole industry that revolves around it."
"At a time when the fleets need modernisation and the workforce related to the sector needs a boost, solutions must be found to reverse this trend."
"I feel that the adoption of this report is a step in the right direction in protecting the interests of fishing communities, not least in Portugal and the Azores."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report."
"– The report on inshore fishing is an excellent one, as it succeeds in identifying the problems facing fishermen involved in this kind of fishing and puts forward realistic and effective solutions."
"If we do not want fishing to disappear as so many other economic sectors have done before it, it is high time for us to take certain measures, such as strengthening the fisheries sector by setting up an inter-branch organisation to promote and develop fishery products from landing to direct sale, including a special heading for 'inshore fishing' in the future European Fisheries Fund, and increasing checks and sanctions in order to avoid unfair competition from third-country vessels that have lower costs and do not comply with the same safety standards."
"Paradoxically, consumption of fish is on the increase throughout the European Union, so now is not the time to drop our guard, particularly in view of the fact that inshore fishing is a very environmentally friendly job that consumes very little energy and supplies an important product."
"It must be aided and supported as a matter of priority, so as to restore its economic balance and protect maritime jobs."
"The EU is at present giving too much money to large fishing operators and vessels."
"This should be redistributed for the benefit of small-scale fisheries."
"I am therefore voting in favour of Amendments 7 and 9."
"This investment in small-scale fisheries should be made within the existing budget framework."
"Under no circumstances do I want proposed measures to lead to an increase in the budget."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0060/2006 – B6-0308/2006) by Vincenzo Lavarra, Roberta Angelilli, Katerina Batzeli, Jean Marie Beaupuy, Giovanni Berlinguer, Giusto Catania, Thierry Cornillet, Giuseppe Castiglione, Donata Gottardi, Umberto Guidoni, Giovanni Claudio Fava, Janelly Fourtou, Lilli Gruber, Claire Gibault, Nathalie Griesbeck, Anne Laperrouze, Pia Elda Locatelli, Andrea Losco, Mario Mauro, Sebastiano (Nello) Musumeci, Francesco Musotto, Philippe Morillon, Pasqualina Napoletano, Pier Antonio Panzeri, Giovanni Pittella, Umberto Pirilli, Lapo Pistelli, Vittorio Prodi, Guido Sacconi, Matteo Salvini, Francesco Enrico Speroni, Luciana Sbarbati, Gianluca Susta, Marc Tarabella, Riccardo Ventre, Donato Tommaso Veraldi, Marcello Vernola, Armando Veneto, Marta Vincenzi, Sepp Kusstatscher, Mauro Zani and Nicola Zingaretti, on the use of wood chippings to age wine, and"
"- the oral question to the Commission (O-0062/2006 – B6-0309/2006) by Giuseppe Castiglione, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the use of wood chips as oenological practice for European wines."
". – Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement has been reached in a meeting of the Wine Management Committee to amend Regulations (EC) No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, with the aim of authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine."
"I wanted to table an oral question, with the support of more than 40 fellow Members, whom I should to thank, on the admissibility of this oenological practice, because I believe that Parliament must be able to express its opinion on an issue that is only outwardly technical but which actually raises some important issues relating to the quality and future of European wine."
"There was an attempt to justify this proposal by the need for us to fall in line with those non-European countries that already authorise this practice."
"I wonder, instead, whether the specific nature of European wine and its strength on the world market do not indeed lie in high quality and respect for traditional practices."
"Has the Commission assessed the impacts of this proposal on high-quality wines?"
"What measures does it plan to adopt in order to ban this practice, at least for high-quality wines?"
"As regards labelling, does the Commission regard the failure to mention this practice on labels as being compatible with our guidelines on transparency?"
"Finally, what would happen during WTO negotiations if, instead of trying to raise standards relating to oenological practices, we lowered them?"
"I should be grateful to the Commission if it would kindly shed some light on these points, not least in view of the next WTO reform of the wine sector."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic moment for our European wine sector."
"The opening up of the world's agricultural markets and ever increasing international competition have called into question our wine production and marketing systems and have forced our producers to become more flexible."
"The use of ‘modern’ oenological practices in many third countries and the less rigorous application of the 'wholly obtained' rule worldwide are excluding our products from our very own market, a market that, on its own, represents two-thirds of global trade in wine."
"If it is therefore truly essential to review the stringency of our rules and if this global challenge really requires us to be more flexible, then it becomes crucial to set limits and conditions for using these new oenological practices."
"It becomes crucial to balance this increased flexibility with the requirements of tradition, quality and consumer protection."
"This opening-up must serve to preserve and enhance the strengths of our wine sector and to give it new impetus, and definitely not to curb high-quality production to the advantage of wines with fabricated organoleptic qualities."
"The Commission wants to justify the proposal under debate today by the need to avoid the risk of confusion for the consumer and to prevent a distortion of competition among producers."
"Commissioner, if this is really the desired purpose and if this is truly the intended aim, then I am sorry to have to tell you that we have a major failure on our hands."
"Genuine consumer protection and a genuine desire to prevent any distortions of competition should have led to a compulsory provision, that is to say, it should have been made compulsory for the use of wood shavings to be indicated on the labels."
"Any other provision is and will remain completely ineffective when it comes to protecting the consumer and even more ineffective when it comes to preventing distortions of competition."
"Only a clear label corresponding to the product’s content will ensure that the information is transparent."
"Only in that way will the consumer be in a position to know exactly what he or she is buying."
"Only in that way will his or her freedom of choice be safeguarded, together with that of the wine grower."
"Not providing for this kind of information on labels means destroying part of Europe's wine sector in the near future, a sector founded on tradition, on diversification and regional character and on a real culture of wine as an expression of our lands."
"European wine growers will have no choice in the matter."
"Sooner or later they will be forced to abandon their traditional practices because their products will, for no apparent reason, prove too expensive in the eyes of a consumer lacking proper, clear information."
"Commissioner, is this the Community’s policy on protecting consumers?"
"Is this the Community’s policy on transparency and labelling?"
"Is this that promotion of the quality of agricultural products about which we talk so much?"
"I would be grateful if you would kindly respond to Parliament as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will answer the two questions on the use of wood shavings in wine production at the same time."
"The aim of the proposal for a regulation of the Commission, which is being reviewed by the Wine Management Committee, is to set out the conditions for using oak shavings in the production of wine."
"The Council ruled on this new wine-making process in Regulation (EC) 2165/2005 of 20 December 2005."
"The Commission feels that the provisions for wine labelling set out in the proposal would fulfil the requirements for transparency for consumers as well as the product quality requirements."
"The proposal sets out rules for labelling wines, the aim of which is to prevent consumers from being misled."
"It also retains the option of stating ‘oak barrel’ or ‘oak barrique’ on wine which has been aged or matured in wooden vessels, and which has never come into contact with oak shavings."
"Under these conditions, it is not possible for wines which have been aged in contact with oak shavings and which display the taste that comes from maturing wine in contact with wood to be mistaken for wines matured by the traditional method in barriques, and so there is no need to state any special information in the case of such wines."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, Member States may stipulate stricter conditions for wine-making processes in respect of fine wines originating from specified growing areas and for table wine with a geographical marking, in order to ensure the preservation of the essential characteristic features of these fine wines."
"The Commission cannot interfere with these domestic powers."
"This process has now been approved for producers in the Union by the Council."
"The International Organisation of Vine and Wine permitted it some years ago."
"The Commission feels that the traditional methods of maturing in barriques will be preserved for producers of high quality wines, as is the case in third countries which permitted this process years ago."
"Long-term use in other wine-producing countries and numerous experiments carried out under EU control show that the process does not have a negative effect on the health of consumers."
"The Commission is of the opinion that greater flexibility in permitting new wine-making processes will enable producers in the Community to increase their market and to reach more consumers, especially through exports, and also to enhance the competitiveness of the wine sector vis-à-vis third countries."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard, current European legislation does not permit European producers to use wood shavings to age wine."
"However, the legislation of other wine-producing countries, in particular the United States, Chile and South Africa, does not provide for such a ban."
"Moreover, on the basis of a recent agreement with the European Union, these countries can export their own wines into the European Union’s internal market without the labelling on the bottles making any reference to the use of wood shavings."
"The Italian wine industry is thus falling victim to unfair competition."
"Until now, it has relied on its diversity, on its ancient vines, and on the quality and wholesomeness of its product."
"Now, the image of a reliable and credible market, which the Italian market is regarded as being, will be undermined."
"Globalisation is inevitably affecting a sector, too, for which we are the envy of the world."
"We will certainly not succeed in stopping it, but we need appropriate guarantees."
"We are not talking about opposing the entry into the European market of this system of ageing, but we are demanding protection of the right of consumers to know what they are buying and what they are drinking, to know what kind of quality they are getting for a particular price."
"Italian and European producers do not need to use tricks or to cut corners in order to sell their products, the high quality of which is recognised worldwide."
"The Wine Management Committee is preparing to approve an amendment to the current standards relating to oenological practices, with a view to authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine, instead of the traditional practice of ageing it in barrels."
"Twenty years ago, the scandal caused by the use of methanol in wine production served as a warning to us."
"Only a production process that is carried out seriously and professionally can last the course in the market."
"There is truth in the adage but for once let us leave it to the labels to reveal the information we are entitled to."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I think that your views on oenological practices and the use of wood shavings are very general and that the Commission has not perhaps understood the basic problem raised by their use."
"I shall summarise it for you:"
"You said that the International Organisation of Vine and Wine allows these oenological practices."
"Have you been told, Commissioner, that international practices must without fail coincide with European practices and that we, as Europeans, are obliged to accept these oenological practices of new countries which undermine the European market?"
"Have you been told, Commissioner, that the Commission can go to the WTO negotiations without safeguarding products of geographical indication, which include wine?"
"Have you been told, Commissioner, by society, by viniculturalists, by oenologists, by the European Parliament, that you can create unfair competition on the European market?"
"Obviously the message you read is very, very general and obviously I agree with my fellow members that the last step taken is to write the new practice on the bottle labels, in order to protect consumers."
"But who is protecting European wine?"
"No one in this Chamber assumes that European wine must be the same as that produced 100 years ago."
"No one in this Chamber assumes that it must not be modernised and no one in this Chamber, knowing the new review of the COM in wine, will refrain from making innovative proposals."
"However, what worries us is that this simple, unopposed use of wood shavings, which you said can purely and simply liberalise or increase the competitiveness of poor quality commercial wine, may cause a fall in the price on the commercial market of good quality wines, of wines with protected names, of wines with geographical indications, of wines which no one in the global trade can undermine and you are opening a back door so that good quality European wines can be undermined cheaply."
"I shall not take up too much of your time, Commissioner, because we shall discuss this with the Commissioner in about a month's time and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development next week."
"However, I would like to ask one thing of you, on behalf of all my honourable friends in this House: fragmentary, dumbing-down practices for the future of wine and the development of the common agricultural policy should be avoided."
"We are calling for your help."
"Otherwise we shall have a very tough dialogue."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in six months, or in a year at most, we will have a reorganised wine market, and I would therefore like to examine our current topic in the light of the general developments that have taken place over the last few years and that will continue over the years to come."
"First of all, I would emphasise – and in this I am practically diametrically opposed to the previous speaker – that, when it comes to wine, the real decisions are made by the consumer."
"We are not forced to drink wine, and we are under no obligation to choose any particular type of wine: it is ultimately up to the consumer to decide."
"So, what has the consumer done over the past few years?"
"We have witnessed a fall in the consumption of table wines and an increase in the consumption of quality wines."
"We have also seen a considerable increase in the number of consumers and, if you have read the press recently regarding the decisions and wishes of China, you will be aware that, within the next ten years, we will have millions of new wine drinkers in the world."
"In addition, we have seen, again at global level and particularly from the new vineyards in the New World, the appearance of new flavours that match the consumers' requirements."
"All of that has happened over the same period of just 20 years, whilst consumers in France have halved their consumption of wine."
"It is therefore clear that there have been many major developments regarding wine consumption."
"Europe needs to be well positioned in this global market."
"I think we are all agreed that we need to act to preserve the globally-acknowledged high quality of our major wines from Spain, Italy and France – and I myself come from Champagne – in order to protect both their quality and their brand image throughout the world."
"At the same time, however, European viticulture needs to adapt to the needs of consumers all over the world."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is why, in view of the changing tastes of our consumers, and given the disappearance of certain consumers and the appearance of others, I think it is quite natural to have the option of using these oak chippings in the production of European wine, provided, of course, that this option is not an obligation, that it is exercised within the framework of our various regulations and, finally, that all Member States may impose restrictive conditions on their use."
"In conclusion, let us not forget that, on our continent, in our 25 Member States, several million jobs, perhaps five million, depend on the production of wine, and that the sector has a turnover of EUR 17 billion – almost exactly the same as the wheat sector and significantly greater than the sugar sector, which is four times smaller."
"For all of these reasons, we need to adapt to the demands of our consumers."
"Mr President, in the wine trade I would be described as an ."
"In layman’s terms, that means I can tell my claret from my hock."
"Indeed, I have taken exams under the UK’s Wine and Spirit Education Trust scheme and have reached the level just below Master of Wine, so perhaps I speak with a little authority here."
"The British market is unusual inside the EU in that it has been growing at a dramatic rate for many years."
"However, we are eschewing wines from the EU in favour of wines from around the world, in particular Australia and California."
"Why should this be, you ask?"
"Could it simply be that they make wine that suits the customer’s palate?"
"Producers in these and other New World countries are not bound by pettifogging bureaucracy that tells them which grapes to grow where and then how to make the wines."
"They produce unsubsidised wines that people want to buy, at a price they can afford."
"But there is another factor in play and that is product information."
"Consider this situation: you are in a supermarket looking at hundreds of bottles of wine."
"You pick up a bottle – like this elegant Pomerol, for example – and try to find out something about it."
"Not everybody carries Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopaedia around with them."
"Why should they?"
"They look to the bottle for information."
"The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information."
"However, this bottle of wine from California tells you more about wine on a label three inches square – that is 10 cm – than most people will ever need to know, including the fact that it was matured in American oak for 12 months."
"Gaining and keeping customers is what business is all about."
"Creating more rules for EU producers to abide by will cripple them and their industry and no amount of subsidy will save them."
"Mr President, according to Rule ... – I do not know what number – it is not permitted to be a salesman selling a commercial product in the Chamber of this House, which is what I believe Mr Wise has just been up to."
"Mr President, at this time when the Commission has to put the finishing touches to its reform of the COM in wine, the debate being held in Parliament today is closely related to the competitiveness of European viticulture compared to that of third countries."
"The Commission says that it wants its reform to promote this competitiveness."
"The use of oak shavings in the production of wines is a practice permitted by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV)."
"The conditions for use of this practice are nevertheless awaiting approval by the Wine Management Committee."
"There is so little protection for the wine sector these days that it has become necessary to reconcile the preservation of traditional practices, such as ageing in barrels, with the possibility for European wine-growers, should they decide to do so, to compete under equal conditions with third-country producers, all while offering maximum guarantees of transparency and information for the consumer, of course."
"In our view, this practice should be applied to wines subject to ageing or carrying traditional mentions such as 'Crianza', 'Reserva' or 'Gran Reserva'."
"The label is there precisely to prevent confusion amongst consumers, clearly indicating whether such a practice has been carried out or not, for example by reserving the term ‘oak’ for traditional ageing in barrels."
"Furthermore, the basic Regulation for this COM allows Member States, in relation to wine-making practices and treatments, to impose stricter national conditions in order to ensure that the characteristics of their quality wines are maintained."
"In the case of my country, the Supervisory Councils are the main guardians of the quality of Spanish wines."
"At the moment, however, the Commission is responsible for establishing the conditions for use of this practice at Community level."
"We would therefore ask you to do so with the necessary transparency, in order to prevent any confusion for the consumer and to guarantee that the same measures are applied to imports from third countries."
"We would also like the Commission to explain to us why it is fragmenting the debate on wine-making practices, when they should be dealt with jointly."
"Furthermore, in autumn 2005, document COM(2005) 395 was communicated to us with a series of technical amendments to the basic Regulation: replacement of the distillation of sub-products of wine production by its withdrawal in Slovenia and Slovakia, modification of the classification of cultivated areas in Poland or new mentions for labelling."
"These amendments did not include the addition of oak shavings, however."
"I do not believe that this is a translation problem, since neither the French version nor the Spanish version introduced such a change."
"If that had been the case, the Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development may not have chosen to deal with this issue by means of the simplified procedure."
"Can the Commission tell us, therefore, when it decided to introduce this new element and why it has not waited for the reform of the COM in order to do so."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like some of my fellow Members, I signed this oral question on the use of wood chippings as an œnological practice for European wines."
"I signed it because I wonder whether, and hope that, guarantees can be given to ensure that the quality wines we are producing in Europe are and continue to be recognised as quality wines."
"It would not shock me at all if this practice were to be recognised and authorised."
"The wine production sector has been waiting for this recognition because it will allow some producers to meet the expectations of international consumers."
"Furthermore, there will be no compulsory expansion of this practice: the Member States will still be free to lay down restrictive legislation for quality wines produced in specified areas."
"Nevertheless, I think we need both guarantees regarding the provision of information on wines that have undergone this practice and also quality guarantees."
"I would like to emphasise that the recognition of this practice, which has been imported from countries outside the European Union, does not legitimise other practices that do not seem to provide the necessary quality guarantees both in terms of health and in terms of identity."
"Wine is a very particular product that conveys an identity and a whole way of life, so let us not move too rapidly towards the practice of 'patchwork' wines."
"Finally, I would like to take advantage of this debate to lay the emphasis on the forthcoming Common Market Organisation (CMO) review, which should give European viticulture a real solution for the future."
"European wine producers need to get the benefit from the worldwide growth in the wine market, and this needs to be ensured through a redistribution of the financial aid from the CMO."
"The decoupling of aid could be the solution that will enable us to give greater responsibility to those active in the sector, with the benefit that all the wine produced will have outlets on the consumer market."
"We need to re-examine the distillation conditions – for potable alcohol and crisis distillation – as part of a system based on a degressive guide price over the course of the campaign."
"Equally, we need to encourage the use of vine-based products to enrich wines, for example using grape must instead of sugar."
"In order to ensure that European wines retain their position as world leaders, the European Union must use the new CMO to construct a policy for promotion, marketing, research and development and training, and it also needs to establish an economic observatory."
"There is absolutely no doubt that we need to reform the restructuring, planting and grubbing up systems in order to respond to the needs of the market over the medium to long term, but we also need to preserve the surface area of vineyards – in other words, we need to preserve the European Union's wine-growing potential."
"It is quite inconceivable for European vineyards to disappear from our landscapes, from our history and from our rural and cultural heritage, which has been shaped over so many years by wine producers on land uniquely suited to growing grapes."
"What will become of this land and of those who live off it, those who have worked to improve their art for the great pleasure of consumers, or perhaps I could say gourmets."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although wine is a product originating from specific regions, it is bought and sold throughout the world, and it is for that reason that an international framework is required to lay down oenological practices and ensure international competitiveness."
"We all know about the special way of enriching wines in Barriques; it is an old tradition, but one justified by the fact that storage in wooden barrels has a positive effect on the wine’s maturation process."
"However, the techniques used for storing wine are not static."
"As we strive to use the best practices in developing wines in line with consumers’ expectations, new knowledge and new possibilities become available to us, and these are being used in countries outside the European Union."
"It is at this point that I ask myself the question as to how we value tradition on the one hand and modern practices on the other."
"None of us would want, in this day and age, to still be travelling around by horse and cart."
"I do not think that the one should exclude the other, but we are losing our certainties."
"Mr Castiglione’s question about the practical legal aspects of allowing the use of wood chips and of labelling is the right one to ask."
"I think we need to take care that our wine labels do not end up being turned into the sort of leaflets that we get with medicines."
"What consumers want is bottles that look nice, with the most important information clearly visible."
"The labelling issue is a tricky one, one that I think is best dealt with at the national or regional level, as it should be."
"It cannot be the European Union’s function to regulate everything right down to the tiniest detail, or we will end up with the sort of thing with which we are familiar in the context of the labelling of allergenic substances, with demands being made for labelling in every conceivable language."
"It must also be clear to us that it is not possible to monitor what is done with barriques or wood chips."
"Where its maturation in barriques or with the addition of wood chips is concerned, wine is a regional product, and the question of objections on health grounds does not arise here."
"Wine has been matured in wood for many generations, and its effects on health are still not a matter of dispute."
"– Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Daul."
"As a wine-grower myself, I may not necessarily agree with everything he has written, but often in politics we say things we do not always mean."
"His speech is written in French, but fortunately we have good interpreters here."
"Mr President, the wine sector in the European Union is a very important source of jobs and income, which are concentrated in small- and medium-sized family-run vineyards that therefore play a vital role in the development of rural areas."
"In the European wine sector, we are witnessing a crisis affecting several European regions, as a result of the gradual dropping off of demand."
"The task of the European authorities, in terms of wine policy, should be based on the need to improve and promote the agricultural quality of traditional production, and on the need to protect that production against the increasing competition from third countries."
"All too often, poor labelling policy is the main cause of the loss of market share for traditional producers."
"In order to prevent unfair competition in the wine market, with its disastrous consequences for our producers, it is vital for us to protect consumers by means of labelling regulations based on transparent information regarding the characteristics of the products, the techniques used, the original features and the methods of maturing the wine."
"The average consumer, in other words the man in the street, sees wine production as a process of maturation in oak barrels, which is why we need to prevent the risk of confusion and deception for the consumer with regard to the quality of the wine and how it was matured."
"To this end, we need to ensure that consumers are provided with the appropriate information to give them freedom of choice."
"It is therefore vital for it to be compulsory to state on the label that oak chippings have been used in the process of maturing the wine."
"Perhaps it is now time to drink a glass of red wine, preferably a Saint-Émilion."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will perhaps be surprised that, as chairman of this Parliament's intergroup on 'wine, quality and tradition', I have not taken advantage of this opportunity to ask my own oral question on the use of oak chippings in wine making."
"In view of the fact that, in the next few days, we will be debating a Commission communication on reforming the common organisation of the market in wine, I think that we need to avoid putting the cart before the horse, and that it takes time to reform legislation that is this sensitive and that so starkly divides European wine producers."
"Some of them tell us that they have been waiting for 10 years to be allowed to implement this practice of using wood chippings, while others see it as an attack on the traditions of European wine production and fear that there is a risk of consumers being deceived on a grand scale."
"Yet others remind us of the responsibility of the Member States, in particular regarding legislation on quality wines produced in a specified region."
"Finally, we must not forget the responsibilities of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), which extends beyond the Community framework."
"As always, the devil is in the details, and we cannot deal with those details now in this forum, so I would like to take this opportunity to warn the Commission against an unseemly headlong rush that would bring with it many dangers."
"First of all, there is the danger of presenting people with a by adopting, in comitology, a regulation on an œnological practice that should be defined when we carry out the reform of the CMO for wine."
"Then there is the danger of creating an uncontrollable bureaucratic monster, with the associated risks of deception and distortions of competition."
"I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to avoid adopting the draft regulation amending Regulations No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, which, as far as I know, has not been adopted."
"With regard to labelling, I would warn against creating a precedent that could have an unfortunate effect on the labelling of alcoholic drinks."
"So far, we have been able to avoid having labels that harm the product and end up being illegible for the consumer, so we must avoid playing with fire in this sensitive area that Mrs Klaß has described so well."
"– Mr President, in contrast to those who have brought in this motion, I have no fundamental objections to the Commission's decision, by which it has legalised a practice to which reference is made in, for example, the US-EU wine trade accord and in individual concessions accorded to third countries since 1984."
"This motion has been drafted at the behest of the Italian Government, and it is for that reason that I wonder why it is that two Italian Members belonging to different groups have tabled it."
"The Commission’s decision also benefits consumers, since the ‘barrique’ practice of maturing wine in wooden casks is traditional with white wine, but particularly so with red."
"A wooden cask of this sort, made of oak and capable of containing 250 litres, costs between EUR 600 and EUR 800."
"It can be used three times at most, so that red wine is at least a euro per litre more expensive if matured in a barrique than if wooden planks – to which there can be no objection on the grounds of consumer or health policy – are used."
"It is in this way that this decision benefits consumers, who can buy high-quality wine at lower prices, and so my view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the motion’s authors."
"To Mrs Batzeli, who said that the low-cost production of quality wines of this sort should not be allowed, I ask where we will end up if we in this House try to prohibit technological progress."
"Of course this discussion needs to relate to the organisation of the wine market, but the fact that Italy asked for it put the Commission under pressure to act, and so I can give Commissioner Špidla my unreserved support."
"From the consumer’s point of view, there is no problem."
"We will have to give some thought to whether we should allow – ‘allow’, mark you, rather than ‘prescribe’ – positive labelling, in the sense that someone could, as an advertising tactic, use the description ‘matured in wooden barrels’."
"That would deal with the competition problem."
"It is in any case better to legalise this practice rather than, over a period of decades, to accept that many are doing it illegally, and so I think the approach we have opted for is the right one."
"Mr President, I always have the privilege, when I make my way to Strasbourg, of driving through the wonderful regions of the Palatinate and Alsace, where I buy my wine."
"I am always impressed with the quality of the products of the European wine producers."
"My own country now also boasts eight wine producers, but I will not speak on their behalf."
"It strikes me as an important topic, if Europe has asked to license this technique."
"That is also evident from the large quantities of wine imports to which this technique is applied, and it would be too crazy for words if we were to deny European wine producers this opportunity."
"I would, at the same time, regret it if the quality of European wines were to come under pressure as a result."
"I do not think that will be the case, because if you have true quality, then you can prove that there is a difference between the use of wood chippings and wooden barrels."
"After all, if a red or white wine has had the chance to age in good, solid barrels, then it will be easier to digest."
"That is the difference between the use of wood chippings and wooden barrels."
"I should like to emphasise that, and also call on the European wine producers, those who produce quality wine and are able to sell their wine without any problems, to continue to use wooden barrels in any event."
"I would also draw your attention to other developments that have taken place in Europe."
"When large wooden barrels were abandoned in favour of steel ones, it was not a requirement to mention this on the label, and neither was this done."
"Express requests are now being made, though, for the use of wood chippings to be indicated on the label, and I can go along with this provided that the regions are given the freedom simply to introduce this obligation or not."
"What is not permitted in any event is for wine to be indicated as having been matured in wood, if this only involved wood chippings."
"That strikes me as crucial."
"In that respect, I should like to concur with the words of Mr Langen when he states that we must exercise caution where red tape on the wine label is concerned."
"We need clarity in this area."
"As a citizen of a country where we drink more wine than we produce, I would call on the European Commission to give this due consideration in the new wine policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to the discussion."
"I will be informing my fellow Commissioner Marian Fischer Böl of the interest that you have displayed."
"As I already mentioned in my introductory statement, the use of oak shavings in wine production was already approved at a political level by the Council last year."
"Within the framework of the Wine Management Committee, there has been an exchange of views on the technical rules applying to the use of wood shavings, and the Commission’s proposal has won the support of most Member States."
"I consider the debate under way here today to be Parliament’s contribution to the discussion."
"The discussion is important because it forms part of the wider problem of how to improve the competitiveness of the European wine sector."
"There is a clear need for action."
"The Commission has just begun another crisis distillation of 5.6 million hectolitres of wine, which will cost the EU budget EUR 131 million in total."
"Expenditure on distillation regularly amounts to more than EUR 500 million per year."
"This is of course not sustainable in the long term."
"The Commission will soon be adopting a communication on ways to reform the wine regime, which will undoubtedly form the subject of complex analysis and debate in Parliament."
"My fellow Commissioner Mrs Fisher Böl has remarked several times with regard to the future of the wine sector that the sector must increase the competitiveness of EU wine producers, improve the reputation for quality enjoyed by EU wine as the best wine in the world, win back old markets and also win new markets in the EU and throughout the world."
"We must create a wine regime that operates on the basis of clear, simple and effective rules, such as balancing supply and demand."
"We must create a wine regime which will retain the best traditions of wine-making in the EU, strengthen the social structure of many rural areas and ensure that all production will be environment-friendly."
"The measures we are discussing today are fully in accordance with the above-stated goals."
"The future of the wine sector depends, among other things, on having a symbiotic link between the best traditions of the sector and practical modern developments."
"Allow me to respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised."
"The first question was on why the Commission was not making it obligatory to identify wine that has been produced with the help of wood shavings."
"The Council Regulation sets out a specific number of mandatory details for wine labels, and only the Council can make it obligatory for labels to mention the wood shavings process."
"It is not possible to make this a mandatory requirement under a Commission Regulation, as stated in the proposal which the Wine Management Committee is assessing."
"The Commission in any case feels that the existing system of wine labelling is too complicated and too rigid, and that it would consequently be appropriate to simplify existing procedures and make them more flexible."
"The use of oak shavings and pieces of oak in contact with wine as it matures has been permitted for 10 years now in most wine producing countries outside Europe, and wine produced in this way satisfies the wishes of consumers."
"The International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which is the international reference body in this sector, approved this process in 2001 and considers it to be a good wine-making process."
"There is therefore no reason for banning the process, or for banning wine produced in this way from being imported into the EU."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the issue of wine processing is an issue of exceptional importance because wine is a traditional part of European agriculture."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Commission is drawing up the appropriate documents, and these will be debated in Parliament."
"On the issue of wine and the powers of the Commission in relation to labelling wine that has been produced through or with the aid of wood shavings, I feel that my communication included sufficient information on the procedural powers of the Commission."
"– Mr President, I have a follow-up question regarding the Commissioner's explanations."
"Did I understand him correctly?"
"He said that there had been an agreement at political level since last year, but, according to my information, the infamous draft regulation amending Regulations No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002 has not yet been adopted."
"For my part, I simply asked the Commission if it agrees with not adopting this regulation in comitology prior to the debates we will be holding on the reform of the CMO for wine, because that is what we are interested in."
"Highly bureaucratic regulations are being made behind our backs, which is why I would ask that we avoid adopting them until we can hold debates here on the practices..."
"Mr President, I wished to echo Mrs Lulling’s question regarding the COM in wine: why have you not awaited the debate?"
"Secondly, I wish it to be recorded in the Minutes that I have spoken on behalf of Mrs Miguélez Ramos, just as Mr Vatanen has spoken on behalf of Mr Daul."
"The decision at political level I was speaking of was the Council decision stating that this process would be applied."
"This matter has now been closed and I feel that it is clear."
"The document you are speaking of is under discussion, but according to my understanding of the law it is not possible to halt the discussion on procedural grounds."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on East Timor(1)."
"Mr President, for many of us, the case of Timor has for many years served as a kind of laboratory for learning how to manage conflicts linked to a colonial heritage."
"At the same time it has served as an example allowing us to test, improve and correct certain international aid practices."
"Nevertheless, the process of international accompaniment which led East Timor to regain its independence also has many grey areas, as usually happens in cases such as this."
"In view of what is happening at the moment, our first observation should probably be that the international withdrawal was rather premature, and I therefore believe that the Security Council’s decision to extend the United Nations mission in that country is absolutely right."
"We must also acknowledge and welcome as very positive the Timorese authorities’ decision to ask for an international committee to carry out an investigation into the violent events of 5 May, when a group of hundreds of soldiers who had resigned from their posts clashed with others who were still in the army."
"Furthermore, these events took place within a context of general violence which has left a number of dead and wounded and thousands of refugees."
"This is clearly not the situation that the international community wanted to see in Timor."
"We cannot therefore now shy away from this situation and we must show our complete solidarity with those who are working to find a solution to the problem."
"In particular, we must support the action being taken by President Xanana Gusmão and Minister Ramos Horta on behalf of the government."
"Finally, I also believe that we must learn from past mistakes and in this Resolution we therefore call for the establishment of mechanisms for horizontal communication and cooperation amongst the international forces, with a view to providing a better service to the Timorese people, as well as effective restoration of public order and of normality in the functioning of the institutions."
". – East Timor is an independent, sovereign State that has been in existence for four years, whose people have struggled for decades against Indonesian occupation."
"It is a country that began life destroyed by the occupation."
"One could not ask the Timorese institutions to be any more democratic than they have been in the years since independence, a fact unchanged by recent events."
"What is, in our view, required at this complex and difficult time is support for a return to normality, especially from the point of view of security, which is in fact already happening."
"The sovereignty of the East Timorese people must also be steadfastly protected, along with their freedom to choose their legitimate representatives. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the democratic functioning of the institutions in the country should be respected."
"The dynamics of foreign interference by the regional powers of Australia and Indonesia must also be rejected, as this has only served to worsen the situation."
"Genuine solidarity and cooperation with East Timor should be promoted, as this will contribute towards the country's economic and social development, and the well-being of the people."
"Although the motion for a resolution before us addresses some of these concerns, its content is tainted by its biased approach to the political situation, which will only serve to fuel internal and external attempts to make political capital out of the situation and could exacerbate tension."
"What Parliament should do right now is adopt an attitude of impartial, unequivocal support for the work and the efforts of all Timorese institutions, which is not the case with this motion for a resolution."
"What is more, the motion for a resolution sidesteps the real dangers of foreign interference, which, as has been well documented, has influenced the way in which events have turned out."
"This approach is doubly dangerous: firstly, as it holds one of the sovereign Timorese institutions entirely responsible for the situation and, secondly, as it fails to warn of the potentially destabilising effect of more or less direct interference in a country already affected by the Indonesian occupation and by the destabilisation that armed militias have repeatedly attempted to cause."
"Lastly, we feel that it is not appropriate at this time to raise the issue of the presence of UN blue helmets."
"The important thing at the moment is that the military forces stationed in the area should remain only until the situation has stabilised."
"They should be subject both to their national chain of command and to the Timorese authorities, in accordance with the bilateral agreements, with the constitutional framework of the country and with the standards of international law."
"In conclusion, this is a motion for a resolution that, in our view, does not reflect the development of the situation on the ground in all its complexity."
"."
"Mr President, a few years ago East Timor was in everyone’s thoughts on account of the bad experiences it had in striving for independence and the suffering caused it by a harsh occupation for a quarter of a century before that."
"The country’s progress towards independence, the restoration of order and the commencement of international relief quickly made East Timor what for us Europeans was an example of the potential afforded by international solidarity and cooperation."
"The recent unrest, violence and the huge numbers of refugees in East Timor have therefore been a disappointment for the international community."
"The disappointment has been especially great inasmuch as it showed that the international community’s faith in a situation where there would be permanent improvement in East Timor was well before its time."
"Now we have to look the truth in the eyes and admit that it often takes more time to solve deep-rooted problems and provide follow-up than is possible using the United Nation’s resources, taxed as they are by a large number of crisis areas, if there is no additional investment."
"The joint proposal by six political groups for a motion for a resolution on East Timor has the backing of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and deserves wide support from the European Parliament as a whole."
"Mr President, I have photographs here of the death and destruction in East Timor."
"They could be pictures from 1999, but they are not."
"They were sent by a friend a month ago, following the terrible date of 28 April when death and riots hit Dili again."
"In 2002 I led the EU mission to monitor the presidential election followed by independence, and we saw clearly what a good job UNTAET had done under the much-lamented Sergio Vieira de Mello."
"We saw how Australia and the other international troops had kept the peace."
"We saw how UNHCR had helped the refugees come back from West Timor and elsewhere."
"Then they all left, and for a time, under President Xanana and the Government of East Timor, things looked good."
"But then the losers of the past struggles, those in the old militias who did not find jobs and others who were disgruntled exposed that dormant ethnic fault line between Loro Monu and Loro Sae, the west and east of East Timor, and tensions between army and police, and so on."
"Now we must call back the United Nations with its agencies, including the civilian police, but this time both they and the international troops of Australia and Malaysia and others must stay to ensure stability, and this time the European Union must be closely involved again and certainly not cut its aid as dramatically as happened after 2002."
"The latest member of the ACP is East Timor."
"We meet with them at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna this coming week and I hope that we can all pull together to ensure that we close ranks to support the people of East Timor, so that they can renew that progress towards peace, stability and prosperity."
". – I was recently in Dili at the start of the recent period of violence among the Timorese."
"Tragic confrontations took place between elements of the police and the military."
"I also witnessed the poignant, dramatic moment of institutional unity, when the President, Prime Minister and the President of Parliament were forced to ask for help from foreign forces to restore order and political stability to the country."
"I should like to point out that the Timorese people gave an enthusiastic welcome to the National Republican Guard, a branch of the Portuguese, and as such European, police."
"The Timorese authorities also demonstrated unity and convergence when two days ago they submitted to the United Nations Security Council requests to strengthen and extend the remit of the United Nations Office in East Timor (UNOTIL) from being a police mission under UN supervision to being a peace-keeping mission under the mandate and leadership of the UN, should the need arise."
"This European Parliament motion for a resolution supports these requests and demonstrates the concern of Parliament and the EU about the situation. It also demonstrates confidence that, with help from friends, East Timor will be able to overcome this serious crisis."
"As European Socialists, we remain convinced that the people of East Timor will overcome this crisis associated with the difficulties of a growing democracy, just as it has overcome previous, more serious crises that have threatened their very existence."
"We also know that a great deal depends on us as Europeans and on the international community as a whole."
"The international community has a particular responsibility to guarantee that the State of East Timor and its people, who have fought against oppression for the independence and sovereignty of their country, have the future they deserve."
"As Kofi Annan said this week, what is happening in East Timor is especially painful because the country is, and I quote, ‘a child of the international community’."
"The fragile foundations of the young Timorese democracy have been exposed in this crisis. Mr Annan went on to say: ‘both the Timorese and the international community as a whole have important lessons to learn from these events’."
"Some permanent Members of the Security Council need to examine their consciences."
"It is impossible to build nations with sound democratic institutions hurriedly in a just a few years."
"To declare ‘mission accomplished’ in order to save money will prove costly, and it is the people who will carry the can."
"The situation can be rectified and nobody should question the viability of the independent, sovereign State of East Timor, which also enjoys independence and sovereignty over the country’s significant natural resources."
"Ian Martin, head of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), who helped with the split in 1999 and who was recently the UN Secretary-General's envoy in Dili, explained the day before yesterday that the crux of the matter was not whether East Timor was a failed State; for him, the bottom line was that this is a country that had been in existence for four years, that was learning to deal with the weight of responsibility arising from independence and to address the challenges inherent in a democratic system."
"This is where we in the EU can make all the difference."
"In this connection, the recommendations in this motion for a resolution to the Commission and the Council are intended to strengthen European assistance for consolidating the democratic institutions, in such a way that human rights and reconciliation are promoted in East Timor."
"Accordingly, Parliament welcomes the unanimous decision taken by the Timorese authorities to seek an international commission of inquiry to look into recent incidents that have led to a high number of casualties and to thousands of Timorese fleeing their homes."
"Parliament will remain vigilant, and is planning to send an mission next October."
"We hope that the efforts of Nobel Peace Prize winners President Xanana Gusmão and government minister Ramos Horta will succeed in overcoming the political crisis, in such a way that the mission can focus on European aid for development in East Timor."
". – Mr President, East Timor formally gained independence in 1975."
"However, the country was then immediately occupied by Indonesia and its left-wing, Islamic dictatorship."
"This small Catholic country with a population of 300 000 remained under cruel enemy occupation for 25 years."
"After regaining independence, it continued to be the subject of various international conflicts, because of its natural resources."
"East Timor must be supported by international organisations and the United Nations mission must continue."
"This mission should not be limited to 130 soldiers, but should involve as many troops as are necessary to protect East Timor’s weary Catholic population from social unrest and conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if one bears in mind that the murderous regime of Gadaffi, the murderous regime of Castro and other murderous regimes joined the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, one can only wonder whether these international organisations wield enough authority."
"The regimes mentioned above are all members of the Commission on Human Rights."
"If we also take into account the fact that our Parliament, which should lead by example, is once again today debating same-sex marriage and that one of the Member States of the European Union has decided to grant civil rights to great apes, then we may surely wonder if we have sufficient authority to assist those people who are most persecuted and who suffer the most."
"They are people who truly have more pressing concerns than those which are often debated in this House."
"Mr President, it saddens me that back in 1999 I made my maiden speech in the European Parliament on East Timor, shortly before the United Nations sent in a peacekeeping force which paved the way for its eventual independence."
"To date, it remains the youngest member of the United Nations, as from 2002."
"Here we are again debating violent unrest in the territory and once again Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia have had to intervene to establish law and order in what is now a sovereign State."
"I would particularly like to express appreciation of the efforts made by Australia in its region in its peacekeeping role, as we recently also saw in the case of the Solomon Islands."
"I support the efforts made by President Xanana Gusmao and the international community to bypass the prime minister, who seems to be refusing to resign and is very intransigent, and to disarm the paramilitary groups, re-establish law and order and enable aid and reconstruction to flow back into the territory."
"I am sure this House will support the European Union and the United Nations in whatever way is necessary to achieve lasting piece and reconciliation on this tragic but beautiful remote island."
"I should like to say how astonished I was that these events in East Timor happened as long as four years after the recognition of that country, since I had believed that, unfortunately, all the factors were present for them to have taken place before then."
"Anyone who imagines that, because East Timor was granted international recognition, it then had everything in place in terms of democratic and other structures and in relation to education, the environment, human rights and the courts is deluding himself."
"I think we were fooling ourselves in imagining that, because we had recognised East Timor’s independence and because the relevant structures were now supposedly established there, the country no longer needed our help to progress in terms of democracy and compliance with human rights."
"Anyone alert to what was happening in East Timor would have realised that, often, the only unifying factor there was the occupying forces."
"Following the recognition of East Timor’s independence, it was clear that the situation was not about to take a turn for the better."
"There was the poverty factor, East Timor being, as we know, one of the poorest countries in the world."
"Then there was the absence of structures and the possibility, which subsequently became a reality, of oil suddenly being discovered there."
"We must, therefore, benefit from the example of East Timor and learn lessons from what has happened there."
"I conclude that if East Timor needs help, as is in fact the case, this should be provided both by the international community and by the religious and voluntary sectors."
"Mr President, I would echo the words of my group colleague, Mr Romeva i Rueda, and emphasise everything that he and others have said on the situation in East Timor."
"Here we are again in an urgency debate in which the few Members present will largely agree that it is bad that bad things are happening somewhere in the world."
"The Commissioner will doubtless largely agree with us."
"Though I would suggest – and I would ask the Commissioner for his view – that it would be useful for the Council to be represented in these debates in order to make them that little bit more relevant and meaningful."
"As I say, I emphasise and reiterate the views of Mr Tannock and Mr Romeva i Rueda about the situation in East Timor."
"This motion for a resolution has a number of concrete steps that we ourselves can take to alleviate the situation in that troubled part of the world."
"It is tragic that a country has regained its independence in order to collapse into such anarchy and that, so many years later, it is still not that much further forward."
"We have a number of ideas in this motion for a resolution to help alleviate that and I hope we will be acting on them."
"Mr President, sometimes it is important to explore the background to a situation."
"East Timor is a country cursed with oil and gas."
"If a country is rich, powerful and developed it can be blessed with such natural resources, but it seems that the fate of a poor country with such gifts is exploitation, strife and international meddling."
"Like many other countries – Côte d’Ivoire, Uzbekistan and Chechnya, etc. – East Timor has been exploited by bigger powers."
"It is inexcusable that Australia, a country that likes to see itself as an advanced and peaceful nation, should be occupying and drilling in the gas and oil fields under the East Timor Sea, and that Australia should be justifying that robbery on the basis that Indonesia – East Timor’s most recent exploiter – gave it the right to drill there."
"What is more inexcusable is that we have tolerated this."
"We should encourage East Timor in any way we can and be sure that our intentions in doing so are pure and not based on our gaining an advantage in oil or gas, and let East Timor get on with the job of developing a viable, peaceful and stable nation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis in East Timor gives rise to a number of complex questions."
"Has the international community failed to prevent the outbreak of violence?"
"What lessons emerge from this for the donor countries?"
"According to the most recent reports, the security situation is calmer, although looting and clashes are continuing, and have resulted in more than 100 000 people being evacuated into the camps."
"These evacuees are now receiving assistance from humanitarian organisations, including partners of the Commission that have already supplied aid to this country before."
"We must do much more, however, especially in terms of providing security, protection, food, water and hygiene facilities, as well as health care and shelters."
"The political situation in the country is very complicated."
"As a result of dismissing one third of the armed forces, deep social and economic tensions affecting the entire country have risen to the surface."
"Mass unemployment and persistent poverty are caused primarily by political factors."
"Ethnic differences may also play a role, although they are not in themselves the cause of the basic economic and political problems."
"What can the European Commission do?"
"In the short term the Commission is determined to help the country overcome its current crisis by providing humanitarian aid to the evacuees."
"The Commission has already given some of its humanitarian partners the task of amending ongoing projects so as to redirect aid to address the most pressing needs of the people in the camps."
"The Commission is also drawing up a decision on financing, which will meet the additional humanitarian needs of the inhabitants."
"At the same time we should try to find ways to assist in the political process."
"The EU has from the outset been determined to assist the government and people of East Timor."
"A solution will not be easy, since the current crisis manifests itself at both the government level and at the level of socially disadvantaged members of society."
"Both the UN and the international community are continuing to play their role here."
"But East Timor cannot succeed – either now or in the future – merely through the presence of UN peacekeeping forces, but first and foremost through development and democracy."
"The next parliamentary elections in 2007 should provide an opportunity to support democracy and will at the same time be a test for the government of East Timor and its citizens, as they decide which path to follow."
"The Commission will continue to consult closely over all these matters with Member States, partner countries and UN agencies, and it will of course continue the political dialogue with the authorities in East Timor both on a bilateral level and within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Every viable democratic state needs strong institutions, operating under transparent rules, and the rules establishing human rights are a cornerstone of democracy."
"I fear that some of the institutions in East Timor have not met our expectations in this regard."
"The country secured its independence precisely because it was able to extend to its citizens the rights denied to them in the past."
"The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has published a detailed report on this topic and I will therefore focus only on selected areas."
"There has clearly been some progress."
"One example of this would be the office of the mediator for human rights."
"I am also delighted to mention the preparation of a bilateral commission on rights and friendship with Indonesia, and I hope that it will enjoy a broad mandate."
"There is a need, however, for progress in the functioning of the police force and the justice system as a whole, as well as in the areas of freedom of expression and association."
"In this regard our support will continue."
"Our latest project involves financing the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation."
"This project has made it possible to gather important information on violations of human rights in the past."
"The report from this Commission was published in 2005."
"We are now considering a further contribution to the installation of peace in this country."
"Both the Members of this Parliament and the citizens of East Timor should know that the European Union is a determined backer of the peace process in this country."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on Syria and human rights violations(1)."
"Mr President, Syria has in recent years been set on a course of democratic reform, especially after the accession to power of President Bashar Al-Assad."
"Unfortunately, progress has been disappointingly slow, mainly because the emergency laws, introduced under exceptional circumstances 43 years ago, are still in operation today."
"Regrettably, in the past few months in particular, numerous violations of human rights against politicians, lawyers, writers and other civilians have been reported and confirmed by independent agencies such as Amnesty International."
"Some, but not all, of those incidents are listed in the motion for a resolution."
"We hope and expect that the Syrian Government will take immediate and decisive steps to remedy the human rights situation."
"Ratification, without further delay, of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment would certainly be a step in the right direction."
"As, of course, would the immediate release from custody and cessation of harassment of human rights activists living and working in Syria."
"Syria and the EU have many political, economic and cultural ties and it is our firm wish and honest desire that such ties be strengthened in the future."
"To this end, an association agreement between the EU and Syria is currently waiting to be signed."
"We are optimistically confident that the Syrian authorities will note the concerns expressed in this motion for a resolution with due seriousness and that they will view the necessity of enhancing respect for human rights in their country with the importance it so rightly deserves."
"Furthermore, that they will accordingly abide by the international principles of respect for human rights diligently and responsibly."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has raised the question many times of infringements of human rights and basic political freedoms in Syria."
"The Syrian authorities are notorious for detaining civil society activists and defence lawyers in political cases, as well as participants of foreign conferences on human rights after their return home."
"These arrests contravene Article 38 of the Syrian Constitution, which guarantees each citizen ‘the right to freely and openly express opinions in speech and writing and by all other means of expression’."
"The Syrian State of Emergency Law, which has been in force since 8 March 1963, also does not justify arresting and holding people in custody without trial for having freely expressed their opinion."
"In May this year, the Syrian security service Amn al-Dawla detained 12 signatories of a petition calling on the Syrian authorities to improve relations between Syria and Lebanon by respecting the sovereignty of each of these countries."
"In the first half of May, the signatures of about 300 intellectuals and civil society activists in Syria and Lebanon were collected for the petition."
"On 14 May, the well-known journalist and universally respected representative of the domestic opposition Michel Kilo was detained."
"On 16 May, two further human rights activists, Nidal Darwish and Mahmud Mer’i, were arrested; more people were detained the following day, including the well-known defence lawyer Anwar al-Bunni."
"Ten days before he was detained, the Syrian Bar Association had suspended Anwar al-Bunni’s membership of this professional body."
"Anwar al-Bunni was supposed to become the director of the Centre for Human Rights, financed by the European Union, which was meant to start operating in Damascus."
"The majority of those detained between 14 and 17 May are being held in the central prison in Adra, near Damascus."
"The European Parliament calls on the Syrian Government and Parliament for the immediate release of these people, and for the political system in Syria to respect basic political and civil rights."
". – Mr President, Syria is on the receiving end of very open threats of war from the outside world."
"The USA, for example, listed the country as part of what they called the ‘axis of evil’, and the EU, too, is very forthright in its criticism of the Syrian regime."
"At the same time, though, there is very close cooperation with Syria; for example, terrorist suspects are flown out to Syria and tortured there."
"Various EU Member States also cooperate very closely with Syria, with the Dutch state bringing Syrian refugees in the Netherlands face to face with representatives of the regime."
"Within Syria itself, there is increasing repression of the democratic opposition, particularly of those who signed the so-called Damascus-Beirut petition, which emphasises the ‘necessity of a definitive acknowledgement on the part of Syria of the independence of the Lebanon’."
"This declaration also states that external influence and aggression, for example on the part of Israel and the USA, are rejected, and the petition includes the same statement."
"A number of months ago, the Left Group had as a guest in this House, Michel Kilo, a member of the Syrian opposition; today, he is in a Syrian jail."
"It should also be noted that many of those arrested are adherents of the Left."
"We demand the release of all these detainees and also an end, once and for all, to the threats to Syria from the outside world, notably from the USA and also the EU."
"We must support Syria’s democratic opposition."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome four representatives from the Syrian opposition who have come here from different parts of Europe to support their countrymen."
"Anwar al-Bunni, Michel Kilo, Khalil Hussein, Safwan Tayfour, Mahmoud Issa, Fateh Jammous, Suleiman Achmar, Nidal Derwiche, Suleiman Shummor, Ghalem Amer, Muhammad Mahfud, Mahmoud Mer’i and Kamal Labwani are only a few of those who were imprisoned in the cruel and inhuman jails of the Syrian intelligence services on 19 May."
"They were imprisoned because they, together with 500 other intellectuals, signed a petition calling for the normalisation of relations with Lebanon."
"They were imprisoned because they want peace, stability and normal life to prevail in the Middle East."
"They were imprisoned because they want the very same things that we want."
"Kamal Labwani came to us a year ago to share here with us the outlook as regards the situation in Syria."
"He told us that when he went back he would be imprisoned."
"He arrived at Damascus airport and was imprisoned."
"Today he faces a life sentence and so far we have done nothing to help."
"Anwar al-Bunni had just accepted the post of Director in the Centre for Human Rights financed by the European Union."
"He was therefore immediately imprisoned."
"Our responsibility for their imprisonment is clear."
"Let us be responsible for their freedom."
"How can we work and live here in dignity if those who come here to talk and to work for us face life imprisonment?"
"We urge you, Commission, Council, Member States, and especially the European public, to help us free those who are tortured, abused, imprisoned and killed, because they want their country and their countrymen to live in dignity and peace."
"The authoritarian regime in Syria runs an enormous number of abnormally cruel political prisons."
"Let Syria free all its political prisoners before we have further dialogue on the Syrian association agreement."
"Mr President, we are correct and honour-bound in this Chamber to take note of and highlight human rights abuses in Syria."
"To express our concern is the very least we can do."
"This motion does, in truth, little more than that."
"I grew up in the Middle East, so I know the region pretty well."
"We also need to take account of the wider backdrop to these issues."
"The fact is that we in Europe are not seen as the good guys."
"We are not seen as having clean hands."
"I would refer you to the official government statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Syria issued on 19 May 2006."
"It says: ‘States which allowed secret flying prisons to cross their airspace and to use their airports and which permitted secret prisons on their territories, which represents a clear infraction of the simplest human rights and international treaties related to this topic, do not have the right to propagate the defence of human rights.’"
"We have left ourselves in a position where Syria can accuse us of breaching human rights."
"It is a crazy world, right enough."
"We are not seen as being the good guys."
"Hypocrisy is the most odious charge we can be accused of."
"We stand accused of it right now, with some justification."
"We need to do more to put our own house in order, as well as look after Syria’s."
"Mr President, I was in Lebanon recently, and I saw that hope is emerging there for the building of democracy and of a democratic country, and for state sovereignty to encompass the whole territory."
"For this reason, Syria is also the key to peace in the Middle East."
"Syria refuses to recognise Lebanon or to establish diplomatic relations with the country."
"It is detaining people who signed the Beirut petition demanding the normalisation of relations between Syria and Lebanon."
"It is arresting journalists, lawyers, workers, officials and members of the opposition on trivial charges."
"We must insist that the Syrian authorities release those who are being illegally held."
"The conditions in which prisoners are held must change."
"Syria should also release prisoners who have been held for years and who are recognised in Lebanon as missing, and whose mothers have asked for intervention and their release."
"We should insist that Syria ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment."
"Mr President, everyone wishes to live a dignified life in freedom, and deserves to do so."
"Promoting human rights and democratic principles is a task that has a global range; it is also the task of the European Parliament."
"History, and often the most recent history, shows that the best guarantee of human rights is a correctly functioning democratic state. This means a state in which the rights of the citizen are respected, and in which each citizen, irrespective of gender, faith or caste, is treated identically."
"We cannot consent to the life of a woman being sacrificed on the altar of her family’s honour in the 21st century."
"We cannot consent to the fact that in a civilised world, in order to justify abuses, a state of emergency was introduced, which serves as a cover for groundless arrests, the use of torture or the murder of civilians, journalists, lawyers or activists fighting in defence of human rights."
"For these reasons, I am in favour of adopting the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the previous speakers have told the House about dramatic cases in which Syrian oppositionists have been detained in recent months, and yet violations of fundamental rights have been taking place in Syria for over 40 years."
"It is intolerable that in a country that is a close neighbour of the European Union, absolute authority should be held by one family clan and their friends and relations."
"For over 40 years a state of emergency has been in place, and the parliament is an institution which is completely subordinate to one party, namely the Baas party, and which is devoid of legislative authority."
"Citizens do not have any electoral rights; they do not have the right to free association, nor do they have political rights."
"In connection with this there is no kind of legal opposition."
"Criticism of the authorities is impossible, and omnipresent secret services and corrupt courts with unlimited power to carry out arrests and use torture complete the dramatic picture."
"However, one of the most urgent problems in Syria is discrimination against a minority, namely the Kurdish minority."
"The one-and-a-half-million-strong Kurdish minority is currently deprived of the most basic civil rights."
"There is a total ban on using the Kurdish language, as there is on any manifestation of Kurdish culture."
"The Kurds do not have Syrian citizenship, and as a consequence they have no passports, no access to education or to the health service and no right to own land."
"We cannot remain inactive in view of this."
"– Mr President, having just, at short notice, taken over my colleague Mr Maat’s one minute’s worth of speaking time, let me say that I share his great concern about the human rights situation in Syria."
"The right to free expression of opinion is, to all practical purposes, non-existent."
"Repressive measures are taken not only against journalists and civil society activists, but also, and increasingly, against ethnic and religious minorities."
"It is of the utmost importance that the EU should delay signing an association agreement with Syria until there have been substantial improvements in the human rights situation."
"We all know that paper is patient; if we were to sign it, the pressure would be taken off the regime, despite the continuing arrest and torture of supporters of the opposition and even though the situation as regards freedom of opinion would not have changed and Syria was still not seeking reconciliation with Lebanon."
"For the EU to put pressure on Syria is not to threaten it; on the contrary, I believe that it would constitute legitimate action against a pretty authoritarian regime on the part of a union of democratic states."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak today about the serious human rights situation in Syria."
"The Commission is monitoring the situation closely and is disturbed by recent developments."
"At the beginning of this year we had some grounds for optimism. The government released hundreds of political prisoners."
"It also undertook to limit the use of emergency laws by restricting them to activities that threatened state security, and it was preparing to set up a national council on human rights."
"At the time we warmly welcomed these positive steps."
"Today, however, we can only lament the set-backs."
"The authorities are forcing through further restrictions on basic freedoms."
"A wave of arrests in May is the most prominent example of this worrying trend, affecting the intellectuals and defenders of human rights who signed the declarations of Damascus and Beirut."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both you and I know some of these representatives of civil society personally."
"They have peaceful intentions."
"We cannot accept the persecution and intimidation of human rights defenders and government critics, or arbitrary imprisonment and the use of solitary confinement."
"Syria does not respect its obligations arising from the UN treaties on civil and political rights."
"The EU therefore responded decisively on 19 May with a public declaration calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners."
"The Commission has fears particularly because one of the persons imprisoned is leading a project within the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Making public declarations is not enough, of course."
"We must monitor individual cases and increase our involvement with Syrian partners."
"The fact that there is no valid Euro-Mediterranean association agreement for Syria means that we are lacking the political basis for an open resolution of these issues with the government, as is the case with other countries."
"Together with embassies of the Member States in Damascus, however, we are making full use of diplomatic channels and we will continue to do so."
"I feel quite sure that the European Parliament will be our unswerving ally in supporting these efforts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on North Korea and human rights violations(1)."
"Mr President, the primary objective of our debate today is to save the life of an innocent man."
"Song Jong Nam is a North Korean man aged 48, who was arrested and tortured by North Korean authorities in January 2006, and was subsequently sentenced to death without a court procedure."
"The date of the execution is not known."
"We strongly hope that he is still alive, and will be released as a result of the pressure exerted by the international protest."
"Son Jong Nam is an innocent man."
"His crime is that he left his country, because he was unable to bear the oppression; he subsequently became a Christian, the Chinese authorities returned him to North Korea, and in the meantime he made comments criticising the system."
"All he did was exercise his human rights."
"Today, this is punishable by death in North Korea."
"His case reflects the direness of the situation of human rights in North Korea."
"Tens of thousands of people are imprisoned in camps and forced labour camps, political prisoners are constantly tortured, many are executed, the majority of the population are destitute, and millions of people are starving in this country."
"The leaders of the country are responsible for their citizens, and I strongly hope that they will not manage to avoid being called to account."
"The European Union has indicated on several occasions that it is ready for a dialogue on human rights, but the North Korean authorities have always rejected it."
"We are also ready to provide humanitarian assistance, but only if it can reach those who really need it; we do not want to support the government authorities with our aid."
"Finally, the practice of the Chinese authorities is unacceptable."
"Chinese authorities have been continuously returning North Korean refugees, fully knowing that the majority of the refugees will be locked up in camps straight away; therefore we call on the Chinese authorities to address this issue in conformance with the international standards of refugee rights."
"Also, we call on the European Commission and the European Council to act more firmly against the North Korean government, to inform them more firmly that we are not indifferent to the way people live in North Korea, that we support them, and we want North Korea to observe human rights."
"."
"North Korea has caught the eye of journalists and scientists who collect knowledge about this state as being the world’s most remarkable country."
"It is moody and unpredictable in negotiations with other countries, and its people appear to be living in unimaginable unanimity and discipline, with boundless loyalty to the mysterious leader and in unrivalled mourning should that leader pass away."
"Despite its virtually complete isolation from the outside world, the country has developed an urban environment and its own nuclear industry."
"Some people outside North Korea sing the praises of the remarkable successes that have been publicised by its regime."
"In their view, those successes were achieved thanks to a superior system and despite the opposition of the hostile outside world since the end of the war in 1953."
"People peddling those successes have a hard time convincing anyone, though."
"Apart from a handful of admirers, it is said that hardly any Europeans could live there, or would want to live here for that matter."
"The success stories were followed by the food shortage."
"Also, there is no longer a deafening silence with regard to what eventually happens to the people in North Korea who do not fit into that model."
"Despite the constitutional freedom of religion and despite the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, anyone who could pose a threat to the regime is dealt with at its own discretion."
"The death penalty is also applied as a political instrument."
"Repression and hunger mean that tens of thousands of people have fled to China."
"In the motion for a resolution, it was decided not to repeat dozens of years of cold war language, but instead it contains sensible proposals, addressed to the government, on human rights, the death penalty, the release of prisoners, freedom of expression, the adaptation of legislation and permission for international inspections."
"Neighbouring countries are also asked not to return refugees, and food aid is supported."
"My group welcomes this approach."
"Mr President, more and more frequently, alarming information is reaching us from North Korea about widespread infringements of human rights."
"The intimidation of citizens, torture and public executions have become part of the miserable everyday existence of the country, not to mention the restrictions on freedom of speech or religious faith."
"Numerous witnesses testify that more than 200 000 people could be held in Korean forced labour camps."
"Prisoners are subject to torture, and live in inconceivable conditions."
"All opposition and resistance to the governing Korean Workers’ Party is firmly put down, and punishment is meted out not only to the oppositionists, but also to their entire families."
"The death penalty, which is still used in North Korea, is imposed mainly for political reasons."
"Local media are censored, and access to international media is extremely limited."
"Besides the political situation, the economic situation is also very difficult in North Korea."
"The local population is escaping to China en masse, not only because of political repression, but also because of growing problems relating to hunger."
"Against a background of general shortages, the authorities are distributing food in such a way that high-ranking party and military officials are favoured, and ordinary citizens are missed out."
"The North Korean Government consistently refuses to allow access to the country for United Nations observers or for non-governmental organisations working in defence of human rights."
"What is more, Korea completely ignores the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee."
"Given the lack of any kind of will or cooperation on the part of the North Korean Government, the international community cannot sit back and watch as individual lives and human dignity are disregarded in the country."
"We have to react to the current situation in the country in order to force the North Korean Government to respect basic human rights, and at least as a first step to open the borders for independent international organisations willing to provide humanitarian aid to the local population."
". – Mr President, the situation in North Korea, if one thinks about it at all, appears depressing and hopeless, but I find myself having, time and time again, to think back 25 years to the days when I was a young assistant in this House and was fortunate enough to have had a hand in the first resolution – which was in support of Charter 77."
"There were three MEPs who worked very hard at the time to bring it about: Klaus Hänsch, who is still a Member here;"
"Today, we find ourselves debating human rights under the chairmanship of a Czech president, with a Czech Commissioner, the Iron Curtain – not least thanks to the courage of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe – having disappeared some 15 or 16 years ago."
"That should strengthen us to hold fast to the truth that the inhuman communist regime in North Korea must disappear as well, and that it will do so."
"Along with Cuba and a few others, it is among the last Communist terror regimes on earth, and we should deploy all peaceful means of exerting pressure – whether political or economic – in working towards the overthrow of this Communist dynasty and its repressive system, towards the release of the campaigners for freedom and resistance fighters in it, of whom there are over 200 000, for these people – who want nothing more than to practice a religion or to express their opinions freely – to be able to enjoy freedom of conscience, and the setting at liberty of those persons from Japan, South Korea and many other countries, who, on the flimsiest of pretexts, have been locked up in North Korea."
"In the case of many of them, it is not known whether they are still alive, and an urgent enquiry needs to be made in order to find out where these individuals are; that is the very least that this regime must do."
"It is for that reason that I would like to make it clear that we are right to make the demand contained in the motion for a resolution, namely that we should resume the human rights dialogue with this country that was suspended in 2003 and that we should ask the Commission and the Council to conduct, in that context, in-depth conversations on human rights."
"We in this House, though, have, over and above that, the task of exerting massive pressure and of ensuring that the response to this is not in the form of words alone, but also of deeds and of the necessary political and economic pressure."
"."
"As a historian, I have, through my studies, acquired some knowledge of the atrocities meted out by the totalitarian regimes in the 20th century."
"What would it have been like for the citizens of those dictatorships, though?"
"As Mr Posselt has already said, it is difficult for us in the free West to imagine."
"This afternoon, we will briefly dwell on the Communist reign of terror in North Korea."
"Mr President, the juxtaposition of North Korea and ‘human rights’, words so often used by this House, is essentially shocking and should prompt us to be quiet."
"By doing this, though, we would leave the so ill-treated North Koreans to their own devices."
"Needless to say, the beloved leader Kim Jong Il has every reason to favour our political inertness."
"Moreover, there is no need for us to expose him and his cronies, for, shockingly, regimes of terror have a habit, in the first instance, of taking care of that all by themselves, even though Pyongyang has been sealed as hermetically as possible and reports from and about the place are few and far between."
"Indeed, the accounts of North Korean refugees speak volumes."
"The urgent question that arises here is: what is the European Union to do about this depressing situation in North Korea?"
"In my view, the Council and the Commission should primarily urge China to apply its growing influence in its neighbouring country North Korea in a positive way, in the sense of an urgent and external restraint of Pyongyang policy."
"In the final analysis, Beijing stands to benefit from this as well."
"This may sound very pragmatic, but this message only aims to ease the material and spiritual suffering of North Korean citizens."
"People, fellow creatures of God, subject to like passions as we are, yearn for freedom of movement and, lest we forget, thought, speech and, above all, faith."
"Mr President, sadly, North Korea remains a constant in terms of human rights violations."
"Furthermore, far from helping to improve its image, certain attitudes on the part of the North Korean Government are simply worsening it."
"One example of this is that government’s repeated decision not to allow access to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, as well as several humanitarian and human rights NGOs."
"Numerous reports warn of the increasing numbers of people leaving the country as refugees, as well as the existence of practices such as torture, summary executions, arbitrary detentions and imprisonment in inhuman conditions and without any guarantees of legal defence."
"Any opposition to the regime is prohibited and any criticism of government policy leads to harsh reprisals."
"The case of Sonj Nam, who has been tortured and sentenced to death, despite repeated calls for the case to be reviewed with greater guarantees, is just one example of this, as previous speakers have mentioned."
"For all of these reasons, we must once again take this opportunity to call upon the North Korean Government: firstly, to comply with the human rights principles and commitments laid down in international law and to incorporate them into its own legislation; secondly, to abolish the death penalty; thirdly, to release all prisoners jailed for wishing freely to exercise their fundamental rights; and, finally, to guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of movement."
"Furthermore, we must call upon the neighbouring People's Republic of China to cease repatriating refugees fleeing North Korea towards South Korea."
"Finally, bearing in mind that the European Union was the first and only body to establish a dialogue on human rights with the North Korean Government, and bearing in mind also that this practice ceased when in 2003 the Council of Ministers sponsored a declaration on human rights in North Korea within the High Commission on Human Rights, it is also urgent that we re-establish that dialogue as soon as possible in order to restore that forum, as has been said."
"Mr President, it is no accident that the motion for a resolution on communist North Korea was tabled by almost all political groups in our Parliament."
"It means that, in this case, we speak with one voice."
"This is good news, because by doing so we strengthen our position."
"We are speaking today about a peculiar kind of political Jurassic Park, about a regime that froze in time 50 or 30 years ago."
"It is the only situation of its kind in the world, because even in Fidel Castro’s Cuba there is opposition, and Castro cannot put everyone in prison."
"We must speak openly about this political archaeological site."
"We must support the diplomatic activities of the Troika."
"As has already been mentioned, we should put a stop to the forced repatriation of refugees from North Korea, who have been hiding in China, strange as this may seem."
"It is good that there are no differences in Members’ views of communist North Korea."
"Let us hope that the European Commission and the Council share our position."
"Mr President, as various speakers before me have already pointed out, freedom, our first European value, for which many of the new Member States have had to fight for half a century, is the most important human right here on earth."
"Alongside Cuba, North Korea, which is today’s topic, is one of the world’s last remaining Communist tyrannies."
"Unless one is a faithful slave of the regime, human life is worth nothing to this ruthless Communist regime."
"As has already been pointed out, in this Communist paradise, what little food there is goes to the privileged elites, the military and the security services."
"The rest of the population is forced to abide by a rationing system, the so-called public distribution system, that has been designed in such a way as to ensure that everyone remains immobile and obedient."
"Recently, the operations of the World Food Programme were suspended by the regime and the private sale of grain was banned."
"A similar criminal policy in the early 90s claimed the lives of millions of people, and to think that some groups in this House fraternise with the people who keep such a regime alive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, North Korea is one of the most problematic countries that the European Union has passed an opinion on in connection with respect for human rights."
"This applies for two fundamental reasons: first, there is a regime of rigid control in place in North Korea, and therefore the public receive only scraps of information on human rights abuses in the country."
"Secondly, North Korea views international intervention on human rights as a covert attempt to destabilise their society or even to overthrow their government."
"As an example of this attitude we might recall their recent reaction to the motion for a resolution on North Korea submitted by the European Union to the UN General Assembly last year."
"Korea afterwards demanded that the European Union and other donors terminate their humanitarian aid programmes."
"We might also recall the explosive reaction to the letter sent by the UN special rapporteurs in April warning about the situation of Mr Son Jong Nam."
"North Korea has one of the worst human rights records in the world."
"For this reason the Commission and the Member States of the EU have been raising the question of human rights in talks with North Korean officials, and they will continue to do so. They hold fast to that position despite the fact that a recent meeting of three political leaders was postponed in retaliation for the UN General Assembly resolution."
"The impending execution of Mr Son Jong Nam and the unusually large volume of information that has come out about this and about his imprisonment is extremely significant."
"Representatives of the Commission and of several Member States met with top North Korean officials on 2, 3, 11 and 24 May in order to express their serious concerns over this case and to emphasise their increasing alarm over the state of human rights in North Korea generally."
"In this context they referred particularly to the death penalty."
"I would like to assure you once again that the Commission will continue to cooperate closely over all of these issues with the country holding the presidency and will maintain contact with the European Parliament."
"In view of the fact that the Chinese authorities are sending refugees back to North Korea, the EU has repeatedly expressed serious concerns over the situation within the framework of the human rights dialogue with China."
"The lack of will on the part of the Chinese authorities to pursue this problem does not in any way weaken the EU’s determination to find a proper solution to this problem."
"The issue is still under discussion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the human rights situation in North Korea is a theme that we must pursue and we will pursue."
"Of this I am in no doubt."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"The next item is voting time."
"– This oral amendment has obtained cross-group consensus."
"It is aimed at reflecting the request made by the authorities in East Timor at the United Nations Security Council for a peace-keeping mission with a UN mandate, should this prove necessary."
"The amendment is aimed at expressing this request."
"The paragraph would therefore read as follows:"
"‘Stresses that the process of gradual reduction of the UN mission in East Timor over the last four years must be reversed and asks for the urgent deployment of a UN-led police force to help restore stability, and a UN-mandated peacekeeping force as requested by the East Timorese authorities on 13 June 2006;’"
"– Mr President, We agreed in the course of debate that we would call for the release of the prisoners, especially of those who had signed the Damascus-Beirut petition."
"Two days ago, two more of them were taken into custody, and my oral amendment involves the addition of both of their names, so that it reads, in German: ‘or, in English: ‘whereas also the recent arrests in Syria of Mr Yasser Melhem and Mr Omar Adlabi …’."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 June 2006."
"I have to announce the recent death of our former colleague Joaquim Miranda, who was a Member of the European Parliament for eighteen years."
"As you know, Joaquim Miranda was the Chairman of his political group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, between 1993 and 1994, and also Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Development between 1999 and 2004."
"He was then with us until the end of the last legislature, for eighteen years of parliamentary work."
"His death is a loss to all of us."
"I invite you to observe a minute’s silence in his memory."
"We will now deal with the only item on the agenda, the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the meeting on 15 and 16 June 2006 in Brussels, and the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the six months of work by the Austrian Presidency that is now coming to an end."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by reporting on what emerged from last week’s European Council."
"This Council was the logical consequence of our concern that trust should be fostered between the institutions, that Europe be dynamised, and that some practical work be done for its people."
"It might be said that we did this under the heading of ‘from reflection to action’."
"This Presidency has opted for, and adopted at the Council, a twin-track approach, which involves, on the one hand, offering a Europe of tangible projects and, on the other, the revival of the constitutional debate, initiating public discussion on the future of Europe and breathing life into it."
"For this Summit, we put together, on our own responsibility, a document listing over 30 practical projects, constituting, as a sort of ‘Agenda 2010’, the rich working programme for the EU in the coming years leading up to 2010."
"At the summit, we also discussed a number of quite specific projects, and some of those discussions have already been brought to a satisfactory conclusion."
"Probably the most important of them was the Financial Perspective."
"It proved possible to conclude negotiations with Parliament on the Interinstitutional Agreement, and so the 2007-2013 Budget is secure."
"That is a respectable compromise: a total of EUR 4 billion extra for forward-looking programmes, a raised limit for expenditure, and also the setting aside of two Budget positions amounting to EUR 4 billion more: these things correspond exactly with the priorities that Parliament had set."
"The second really important topic was the Services Directive, and this was a clear indication of our ability to reach agreement even on contentious issues."
"It is with reference to this that I would like to pay your House a particular compliment, for it was your House that in fact showed the way – indeed, it virtually smashed through a wall to create a doorway in so doing – in which a highly contentious issue can be resolved through successful liaison with the social partners."
"We spent a great deal of time behind the scenes with the two sides of European business and industry, who had been able, for the first time ever, to take part in the Spring European Summit, and I do believe that our cooperation with them was highly successful."
"The third topic was the improvement of protection for European citizens when abroad and how to make consular cooperation more efficient."
"We have now been able to ensure a vast improvement in the coordination of consular offices on the ground, of any teams sent into a crisis zone, and of the deployment of transport when disasters strike."
"The report by Michel Barnier, which was delivered to me and to Mr Barroso at the beginning of May, has become the basis of a Presidency document that has enabled us to agree on a very precise programme of tasks for the next eight presidencies."
"We have also made substantially better progress in our endeavours to set up a single visa centre and implement pilot projects in the transit regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova that are intended to offer the most effective possible protection to asylum-seekers in their own countries."
"Provided that conditions are fulfilled, it should be possible to add the new Member States to the Schengen area by the end of 2007 or early 2008."
"We had cribbed from the Commission the idea of a debate about the direction in which we should be going; the first, at the Spring Summit, had to do with energy, and over dinner at this one we had a free discussion of the issues of integration and migration, at which – although it was Mr Barroso and I who got the debate going, the star was the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, who gave a very interesting presentation on the current problems."
"I find this sort of free discussion on a new subject unbelievably exciting."
"This is one of the most important problems of our time, at any rate for the public in the states concerned, and I would also like to thank the Commission for all the considerable help it gives on the ground."
"Now, working together with the Member States and with the Commission, we have put in place arrangements for the monitoring of the West African coast, where, at present, at a number of locations, crowds of up to 50 000 people – in many places – wait until the sea is calm and then, in suitable vessels, each equipped with GPS and laden with enough food for a five-day journey, set out for the Canary Islands."
"This is an urgent matter, and one to which we cannot close our eyes."
"It was highly interesting to hear this free debate for the first time, and I agree with Professor Weidenfeld, who has said this in a recent interview: ‘The truth is that Europe is the most vulnerable continent of all, not only by reason of the waves of people who force their way into our countries or want to get in, but also of security problems.’"
"The Council reaffirmed the importance of the European Institute for Technology, concerning which the Commission will be submitting a proposal before the end of this year, and the Institute will then be operational by 2009 at the latest."
"Our enlargement of the eurozone sends a vitally important message to the effect that the zone is open to all new Member States and that it is not some sort of fortress or ‘closed shop’."
"Slovenia will be joining it, and so the same course is open to all states that have carried out reforms."
"I want to say quite frankly, though, that we must not interfere with the criteria. That is my personal view or the opinion of a majority based on the very serious debate we had about the criteria."
"I also want to be quite frank in telling your House that, if we do, the credibility of one of the most important projects in European integrations is in jeopardy."
"We have made a start on the energy policy."
"An action plan for the 2007 Spring Summit is in preparation, and is intended to ensure security of supply for the consumer, while also having a considerable effect on the environment through the saving of energy and the use of renewables."
"I am grateful to the Member States and the Commission for their willingness to go for a new approach to one subject that was of particular personal importance to me."
"I pressed for a special action programme to deal with rare diseases, particularly those afflicting children, such as, for example, systemic lupus erythematodes, MPS or other rare diseases, which result in terrible pain and in most cases death within a matter of a few years."
"There are so few patients spread across all the European countries that no effective programmes to help them can be developed on a national basis."
"The Commission will now play a coordinating role, and the Seventh Framework Programme will develop effective interventions that will bring real added value for the public."
"I see this as a really important thing to do, particularly since the persons concerned are so seriously affected."
"The Spring Summit set in motion a number of important developments in the field of youth unemployment, with opportunities for training and further education, the possibility of every young person finding employment within six months, or, by 2010, within four months."
"This European Council also saw the sustainability strategy, a completely revised and comprehensive instrument, embodied in a resolution."
"This environmental compatibility strategy is a quite essential element in the European model for living and is therefore something that we will affirm in the long term."
"Let me now turn to the subject of the citizens’ Europe and the constitutional debate itself."
"One year on from the adverse referendums in the Netherlands and France, it was our task to evaluate them."
"First, though, we have to allow the period of reflection, which has generally been ridiculed as a pause for reflection, with more pause than reflection, to be completed."
"That period may have been necessary – for it allowed us to take soundings to gauge how we may proceed – but it is not enough."
"Reflection is not enough; what we need is action."
"We also need a very clear timetable for how we move on from here."
"We also know that new elements need to be incorporated in the text of the Treaty."
"It is difficult to imagine another vote on the Treaty as it stands, and that is why it needs new elements, although they must not touch upon its substance."
"It was important that this distinction be highlighted, and the discussions at the European Council did a good job of that; not one single member of the Council questioned the substance of the constitutional treaty – I shall have more to say about that later on – and that is something I see as one of the major achievements of this period of discussion."
"I can tell your House that the German Presidency will therefore, during the first six months of 2007 – the deadline has been deliberately left open – present a report on the state that discussions have reached and on the possible further developments."
"The new element – and this I say on my own personal responsibility – can be either a name, an interpretation, an annex or a matter of method."
"That will need to be discussed, but I do believe that the substance must remain unchanged."
"Further decisions will be taken on the basis of the report by the German Presidency, and a timetable has been set for them, so that this stage must come to an end by the beginning of the French Presidency at the latest – the earlier the better."
"It may even be earlier than that, but it must be in the second six months at the latest."
"Something very important – and in this we have taken up an idea and a suggestion from Mr Barroso – will be a special meeting of the European Council to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, and this will be held in Berlin on 25 March 2007, on which occasion it is intended that the European social model should be defined in a statement that will be significant in much the same way as, for example, the Declaration of Messina 50 years ago."
"During this past six months, we have been able to clarify a number of matters concerning enlargement and also to take it further."
"Over this period, we have – as the Council Conclusions reiterate – underlined the accession date of 1 January 2007 for Bulgaria and Romania."
"At an informal meeting specifically for foreign ministers from the Balkans, we have laid down and underlined the prospects for their accession and for that of all the Balkan states."
"We have made a start on negotiations with Croatia and Turkey, confirmed Macedonia’s status as a candidate, and signed the stabilisation and association agreement with Albania."
"Following the success of the referendum in Montenegro, we have recognised that country’s independence, and we are now, together with the Serbs, giving consideration to a special plan of action, similar to that for Croatia, which will enable us to offer the Serbian people a perspective at a time of great difficulty for them."
"We asked the Commission to define, at this European Council, what is meant by ‘absorption capacity’, and I am quoting the conclusions of the October 2005 Council with regard to the commencement of negotiations with Turkey and Croatia when I describe that as a vitally important condition for the accession of new Member States."
"That must not be allowed to become a mere rhetorical phrase, but must be a living concept, and one backed up by verifiable criteria."
"The intention is that this special report should be presented this autumn, simultaneously with the annual progress report on enlargement."
"The third topic was how to simplify the Union and make it more efficient and more open."
"The debate on the future of Europe, the ‘Sound of Europe’, the ‘Europe begins at home’ subsidiarity conference, the upgrading of Europe Day, and the discussions with young people, artists and opinion formers in the Café de l’Europe, saw us, to some degree, breaking new ground."
"Together with the European Parliament and with the national parliaments, we have staged a very large number of events, and, most importantly, hosted a major informal meeting of foreign ministers in Klosterneuburg, the results of which I can inform you about in brief."
"In order to further improve working methods and comitology, we worked very hard – as I, at the outset, promised that we would – to get the Council, when acting as legislator in the codecision procedure, to take its decision openly and in public, and actually succeeded in this."
"It was difficult – and I will be quite honest in admitting that certain Member States were very hesitant about it – but we did accomplish a quite crucial forward movement, and one that your House has consistently demanded."
"It is also envisaged that the European Parliament will have a major part to play in the comitology procedure, and, while the practical implications of that are understood by nobody, I do know that this was something to which you attached great importance."
"Mr Winkler, our Secretary of State, who is sitting behind me, spent veritable hours on end in finding a way in which we could move forward together on this, and I am most warmly appreciative of his efforts."
"He spent more time in the European Parliament than in Austria."
"Most of all, he ensured that your House will have an equal say with the Council in decisions reached under this procedure."
"What is now needed, of course, is for these provisions to be given practical effect."
"As regards subsidiarity, we have ensured that the national parliaments are more involved."
"As regards better – which means less – regulation, we have, in what was another initiative on the part of the Commission and of certain Member States – ensured that we will discuss how we move forward at the 2007 Spring Summit, when it is to be hoped that we will be able to agree on a saving target amounting to a reduction of 25% in administrative expenditure."
"It is of course the Commission that will submit proposals for this."
"As I draw to the close of my remarks, I would like to say something about a number of important contributions to European internal policy."
"What always matters most to the public, of course, is what the effect is on the creation of jobs, and what I, personally, am happy about – and this is not, of course, something for which the Council can claim credit, but primarily the result of economic trends and also of the Member States’ policies – is that, in June 2006, there are over 2 million more jobs in Europe than there were in June 2005."
"That is a good result for the new Lisbon Strategy, and one we can show to the world."
"It also demonstrates that our ambition of creating 10 million more jobs by 2010 is a realistic one if the conditions are right and if we do our homework properly."
"It was very important to me that we should reinforce national ownership and political responsibility and that we should hold to account the ministers within whose remit the internal market and the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy fall."
"I have written to all the Member States and talked with their representatives in person."
"I am glad that we are able to congratulate six more Member States who have appointed as coordinators their ministers for the internal market, one of whom, I might add, is Mr Bangemann, our own Minister for the Economy and Labour, which brings our number up to fifteen."
"It is to be hoped that the other ten will join us."
"I would also ask your House to do a bit of advertising for national ownership back home."
"Something else that was important was, of course, the research programme; now that the figure has reached EUR 54 billion, there is something like 60% more available in research funding."
"Small and medium-sized businesses have been strengthened; the European driving licence is up and running; the European infrastructure costs directive has been adopted in these past six months, as have the trans-European networks."
"Next week – on the last day of the Austrian Presidency – the first ground will be broken for the test tunnel for the Brenner Base Tunnel, which is probably the largest and most important infrastructure project to have been planned – and also co-funded – by Europe."
"Public local transport, public services and services of general interest are another area where we in the Austrian Presidency have been able to produce a very good consensual solution."
"In terms of relations with third states, there has of course been the summit meeting with Japan, another one with Russia, and tonight and tomorrow, of course, one with the Americans, about which I am sure I will be able to say something more in the course of debate."
"It has to be conceded that, a year ago, there was sadness in the air, and with good reason; the budget had failed, the Constitution was on ice following two failed referendums, and terrorists had detonated bombs on London’s buses and underground railway."
"The services directive was proving nightmarish, especially for the trade unions and for small and medium-sized businesses, and there were deep chasms between the Member States and one another, between them and the institutions, and – most of all – between the citizens and Europe."
"I certainly do not wish to claim that all these things have been resolved – far from it – but I do want to say that we are now financially secure for the next seven years."
"The services directive seems to have sorted itself out to everyone’s satisfaction."
"In the course of the year, five more Member States have ratified the constitutional treaty and another is due to do so in the autumn, while two others have told this European Council that they are giving consideration to this course of action, and none of them have questioned its substance."
"I would like, then, to say a big ‘thank you’ for what Team Europe has done over the past six months, firstly to the European Parliament, where members of the Austrian Government have put in an appearance on over sixty occasions, and our statisticians tell me that this amounts to the highest turnout of all presidencies bar none, but I would like most especially to thank your President, Mr Borrell, for his cooperation, his friendship and for the suggestions he has constantly been making."
"I would like to thank the group chairmen for the many discussions we have had, whether in the groups themselves, here in your House or in the committees."
"I would like to assure the Commission of my respect and my friend Mr Barroso of my gratitude, with the same also to Mr Solana, the General Secretary with responsibility for external policy, to the Council Secretariat and, last of all, to my own team."
"I can say to you quite honestly that it has been for us a real joy and honour to hold the presidency of Europe for six months and to work together with you."
"You have no cause for fear, for the forthcoming presidencies have, of course, enough to do already."
"After all, our anthem is the Ode to Joy, not an ode to sadness, so, as this Austrian Presidency draws to a close, we should simply say: Let us bring a bit more joy into the work we do."
"Thank you very much."
"So we should be cheerful, Chancellor, and thank you for your speech."
"Before giving the floor to Mr Barroso, I think that I should take this opportunity to thank not only yourself but also your Ministers and all of your staff for the excellent way in which you have cooperated with the European Parliament during your Presidency."
"I must stress that this thanks is not only personal but also goes to all of the people, both men and women, who have supported you and your Ministers when you have attended Parliament and in the work that is done behind the scenes."
"Thank you for your three debates here in the European Parliament; thank you also for the two debates that you took part in at the Forum between national parliaments and the European Parliament, and of course thank you also for the speed with which your Ministers made progress on one of the most complex issues, which you referred to, that of committee procedures."
"Their work was done quietly, silently, and was meticulous and detailed, overcoming some of the most longstanding obstacles to greater participation by the European Parliament in the task of legislation."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin with an apology as, contrary to all principles, I cannot stay until the end of the debate, because I have a long-standing commitment to be present in the Belgian Parliament, where I shall meet both chambers – the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies."
"The Commission will be represented, as usual, until the end of the debate and we are always ready to answer any of your questions."
"Let me start by telling you that I think this last European Council confirmed that we are really moving forward in Europe."
"Last week here in the European Parliament we discussed how this European Council offered a real opportunity."
"It gave us all a chance to confront the sense of pessimism sparked by the ‘No’ votes on the Constitution and to challenge again the mistaken perception that Europe is at some kind of standstill."
"Yes, it is true that we have problems and we have important problems to solve, but it is not true that we have been paralysed."
"So this European Council was important to show the way forward to a solution to the institutional issues we still face; to give our citizens a clearer idea of how to move ahead to a more democratic and more effective Europe."
"The European Council confirmed that we are now moving from a period of reflection to a period of engagement."
"It set out a series of key actions which add up to a major programme of action and it agreed how and why we should take the next steps towards an institutional settlement."
"I should like to pay a very sincere tribute to Chancellor Schüssel for steering the European Council so effectively."
"I should like to congratulate him, all his colleagues, the members of his government, the permanent representative – all his team – for a very successful Presidency."
"I think, with the great Austrian sense of composition, the Austrian Presidency made a very important contribution to our common project."
"I think – and I have said it before – that it was a Presidency full of substance and style, and I thank you very much for that, Chancellor Schüssel."
"I am also proud that the Commission was able to contribute so much to this European Council, feeding the debate with ideas and pointing the way forward."
"The European Union is now pursuing the twin-track approach that was set out by the Commission in our document of 10 May: first, pressing ahead with delivery of concrete action in strategic policies; and second, drawing on the lessons of the past year, moving ahead on a step-by-step approach towards an institutional settlement."
"It paved the way for action across a wide range of policies."
"To pick just a few of the points, security, freedom and justice for our citizens constitute a real priority for the European Union."
"Member States agree that more needs to be done at European level addressing problems such as illegal immigration, trafficking of human beings, terrorism and organised crime, while guaranteeing respect for fundamental freedoms and rights."
"As Chancellor Schüssel said, there was a first orientation debate – which was very useful – regarding the issues of migration and integration."
"Unanimity is holding up moves to make security and justice more effective and fairer across Europe."
"I should have liked the European Council to agree without delay the use of Article 42 in the existing Treaty."
"That was not yet possible and I regret that."
"However, it was possible to leave the door open to use the bridging clauses for freedom, security and justice."
"Of course, we shall have to look at this on a case-by-case basis."
"I have no problem with that, because the argument for change is compelling and I am convinced that change must also include moves to codecision to allow proper democratic scrutiny."
"The momentum was stepped up still further on our economic, social and environmental agenda."
"There will be much more to come on this between now and the end of the year on innovation, energy, emissions trading, the European Institute for Technology and on very important projects for a Europe of results."
"For instance, as Chancellor Schüssel has already said, some of those projects will be followed by a group made up of the forthcoming presidencies."
"For instance, our European response for civil protection will be based, hopefully, on the very good report presented at my request and at the request of Chancellor Schüssel by Michel Barnier."
"In particular, the European Council endorsed the Commission’s proposal for a fundamental review of the single market and the programme on sustainable development."
"The Council rightly stressed the social dimension of the Union’s actions and welcomed the Commission’s intention to take stock of social realities in the European Union."
"This work is already under way and during the first half of next year we expect to present, together, our fundamental review of the obstacles still remaining to the internal market and our assessment of the social situation in Europe, which, of course, also includes an analysis of the demographic challenges that Europe faces."
"We are, as you know, already working hard in that area."
"Enlargement is a profoundly important issue for our Union."
"I welcome the fact that the European Council reaffirmed the common objective to welcome Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007 as members of the Union if they comply with all the conditions that were clearly set."
"The Council also restates that the future of the western Balkans lies in the European Union."
"As I said to you last week, we must ensure that the European Union does not simply enlarge by default."
"We must ensure that the Union is able to function politically, financially and institutionally."
"The European Council faced this issue head-on and later this year we will have a detailed debate to clear the air and to leave no doubt about how we can build a strong Europe with enlargement."
"We took a first step towards enlargement of the eurozone as well."
"Slovenian membership of the euro is a real sign that the dynamism of European integration remains strong."
"It is, of course, very important for Slovenia, but it is also important for the European Union as a whole."
"The enlargement of the eurozone to include one of the new Member States is an extremely important and positive step in the European Union’s economic and monetary integration."
"There was also a commitment to get the most out of our external policies through more efficiency, coherence and visibility."
"This is not just political correctness: the Commission’s proposals in its ‘Europe in the World’ document can play a real part in helping to realise Europe’s global potential."
"I also warmly welcome the fact that the European Council agreed on a programme of transparency, including legislating in public on all legislative acts to be adopted by codecision."
"The Council also endorsed the Commission’s policies on better regulation and the role of national parliaments, important measures to improve the way we do our work and to make the Union function better."
"All these areas – transparency, better regulation, subsidiarity – are crucially important to show that the European Union is not, and should not be, the bureaucratic thing that our opponents sometimes present and that we are not remote and we really wish to engage with citizens."
"Because, as I have often said, we have to understand that today the only way to build Europe is not in a bureaucratic or technocratic way, but in a really democratic way."
"By any reckoning, this is a Europe of results, a Europe making a real difference on issues facing Europeans every day."
"But where the European Council took a new direction was in showing that the institutional issue is not dead, dormant, asleep, or whatever word the euro-pessimists might use."
"There is no question of abandoning our conviction that institutional reform is essential."
"Everyone around the table in the European Council recognised that the case for institutional change has not changed; it is just as pressing as when national leaders put their signatures to the Constitutional Treaty."
"The European Council confirmed, as I have said very often, that the Nice Treaty is not enough, that we need an institutional settlement for our enlarged European Union."
"As the Commission set out last month, we should take a ."
"After all, that was always the method in the European Community since it was founded almost 50 years ago."
"The European Council has asked the forthcoming German Presidency to present a report to the June 2007 Council, which will contain an assessment of the state of discussions and explore possible future developments with a view to concluding the process by the second half of 2008."
"I welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the Commission’s idea of a political declaration to be adopted in Berlin on 25 March 2007."
"When I speak about the institutional rules, I have to be very clear."
"What we need is not just a change of the rules to be more efficient, but also a confirmation of our values, and this is, of course, the substance of the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Berlin Declaration of March 2007 must be more than a commemoration of past achievements."
"It must be a restatement of and a recommitment to our values and ambitions, looking to the future for an enlarged Europe."
"It must include a commitment to deliver."
"We do not need a long text – that is why I have always spoken about a Messina-type declaration, because it was a very short, well-written text – but we need a deep reflection and a real debate about the priorities of Europe."
"Europe has moved on hugely in recent years and we need to set out the highly political nature of European integration today."
"I believe that it is critical that we will sign this together as a collective act of will, and that the European Parliament will sign that declaration, alongside the Member States and the Commission, as proof that the European Union and its institutions are working together towards the same goals."
"We have to build this Europe in a spirit of true partnership."
"We cannot be complacent."
"If we are to use these opportunities and to take the steps needed, we must be more active, we must look for creative solutions to the institutional questions, we must continue and intensify dialogue with our citizens about where Europe is going next."
"We must press ahead with a vigorous policy agenda: a Europe of results delivering the policies our citizens need."
"Last week’s European Council gave us renewed confidence that solutions are forthcoming."
"I should like once again to thank the Austrian Presidency, because it is true that Europe is about an internal market; it is true that Europe is also about a political project; but the Austrian Presidency reminds all of us that Europe is not only about the market, or about regulations: Europe is also about values, music, literature, culture and our European way of life."
"As I said at the start of the Austrian Presidency – when our Austrian friends chose that beautiful logo with so many colours – it was crucially important to change from the dark grey of most of the discourse in Europe to a more confident colour, not because we are irresponsible optimists, but because if we want to lead we have to lead with confidence."
"We cannot lead if we are pessimistic, and that is why we need to show Europe a new way of defending our values in a more globalised world."
"I believe that is the right way for Europe to move forward."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Poettering waited until the last minute!"
"We have been sitting here all this time, asking ourselves when election campaign support would finally arrive."
"It came at the final hour, but that is how it should be, so we will allow it."
"Chancellor Schüssel, I want to start by saying thank you to the Austrian presidency for its fine work."
"You made reference to the fact that your team set a record in terms of attendance."
"I have otherwise been very critical of the Council presidency’s attendance, but must certainly admit that the Austrian Council presidency was present in this House and available for dialogue."
"I also want to say clearly on behalf of our group that Mr Winkler was frequently present in the European Parliament, and came away unscathed from the experience."
"Thank you very much for this, Mr Winkler."
"When we listen to you, Chancellor Schüssel, or to the President of the Commission, things start to become more agreeable, given that in every third sentence of your speeches, you talk about social cohesion, social responsibility in Europe, the importance of social policy and the decision that the Services Directive entailed, and which points the way ahead."
"We can sense it: the neoliberal spirit of the time has passed, thank goodness."
"The Commission and, above all, the Council presidencies, are increasingly coming to the realisation that economic and monetary union in Europe will not succeed unless supplemented by social union."
"In this respect, the Austrian presidency has been a step in the right direction."
"That we should hear this from the mouth of the President of the Commission is for us a cause for satisfaction, at least for the moment."
"It does show, however, that there is much to be done for the future."
"Our parliament has amended the Services Directive."
"Mr Bartenstein, our thanks have already been expressed to you and I, too, wish to thank you for the invitation accorded to members of the European Parliament – I can no longer recall where it was, Graz or somewhere else, it is impossible to remember all those beautiful places with monasteries and other things where people go skiing."
"It was good that you invited Members of this House, thereby demonstrating that you are bearing in mind the parliament’s prerogative in this legislative process."
"One thing is clear, the Services Directive is the first instance in the history of the European Union of a directive having been written by Parliament."
"The neoliberal composition which Mr Bolkestein presented to us was not a workable proposition."
"It is gratifying that, given the heterogeneity of the right wing in this House, particularly that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the socially responsible elements in that group followed our lead, our rapporteur and the line we have taken."
"What is even better is the fact that the Commission has not made any amendments, and the crowning glory is that the Austrian Council Presidency has also put its stamp on it."
"Congratulations on this social progress in Europe, which has been achieved with the help of the European Parliament."
"You were right to point out that a range of matters have been finalised in the Councils of Ministers."
"Yes indeed, the Councils of Ministers act and make decisions."
"The specific work undertaken in the Councils is working."
"What is not working is the Council of European Heads of State or Government which, as a rule, does not decide on anything."
"What has now been decided on is positive in one aspect."
"I will certainly admit that the declaration of support from all of your counterparts regarding the substance of the constitution that you have presented as Council President has been positive."
"I could scarcely believe it when I saw the press conference on TV when you said that they had all declared their support for the substance of this constitution."
"The question can certainly be asked as to why your fellow Heads of Government so seldom do this in public, why they only do things behind closed doors and leave you to it."
"Mr Vanhanen sets a good example, and has himself declared his support for this constitution."
"I think it is tremendous that Mr Jacques Chirac too has declared behind closed doors his support for this constitution, and has now been joined in this by Mr Jan Peter Balkenende as well."
"Had they done this more openly during the elections in France and the Netherlands, Europe would now be one step further along the road."
"The key point is that they do it furtively."
"It is good, though, that the substance has been preserved."
"It is also clear to everyone in this House that it is on this substance that we have to build."
"The only problem is that we are now losing another year, time we urgently need to implement the reform steps inherent in the constitution, the basic prerequisite for the EU’s economic and social success, as well as success in terms of its enlargement."
"Again, these reforms have been postponed for another year."
"This is the less satisfactory message emanating from this Council."
"I wish to finish with a comment on the forthcoming EU-USA summit."
"In addition to the success surrounding the positive declaration of support for enlargement to include Bulgaria and Romania, which our group expressly welcomes, given that it is a positive sign of the dependability of European policy, you made a clear statement on Guantanamo, and on that we congratulate you."
"As I said last week, Guantanamo is a lawless zone which cannot be tolerated by a community based on the rule of law."
"I hope that you will, tomorrow, say that with the same clarity to the President of the United States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a piece of Mr Poettering’s election campaign and an entire speech from Mr Schulz’s election campaign."
"That is refreshing for this House; and also the idea of turning the Presidency into an electoral campaign is something quite new."
"However, Mr Schüssel, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, from an artistic point of view your Presidency has been a complete success."
"There was a Presidential logo – those beautiful ties you are all wearing – and there was music; there were paintings and wonderful dashes of European colour."
"This aspect of the Presidency really has been very pretty."
"In sporting terms, too, there have been great successes."
"You have organised a football tournament in which Austria has not only played, but also won, as I have heard."
"Congratulations, and I suspect that this really has created more public interest than many a political decision, sad as this may be."
"The tone of the Austrian Presidency has been calm."
"You have always made yourselves available to the European Parliament; warm thanks are therefore in order."
"Recently some important political sagas have been brought to a conclusion: the Interinstitutional Agreement, for example, or the Services Directive."
"Last week’s summit, however, was unfortunately barely visible."
"The informal motto almost seemed to be: we will meet up, and no one will notice."
"From this we may conclude that the European Heads of State or Government need a reality check."
"The EU has already had a pause for thought for one whole year, and now this is just going to continue."
"Now there is a timetable for the route map and the period of reflection is to be followed by a period of results."
"It sounds good, but the sad reality is that no one is listening."
"The game is blithely continuing: when Europe produces a good policy, national governments proudly take the credit; when a bad policy comes along, they say that Brussels decreed it."
"The European Heads of State or Government must realise that the Constitutional Treaty – that you, Mr Schüssel, and your colleagues signed in 2004 – cannot enter into force like that."
"I was therefore glad to hear you say that there was at least a shared view that the substance of the Constitutional Treaty should be retained, but not necessarily the Constitutional Treaty itself in this form."
"Why then does the Council not just say this openly and clearly, and why does it not direct its ideas and energy into finding out what should be done instead?"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports a Constitutional Treaty that clearly specifies the division of powers between EU Member States and the European institutions, and that describes the basic rights and values that bind us together."
"The sooner the Council deals with this reality, the sooner the dialogue with citizens can really begin."
"In this context I would like to emphasise to you, Mr Schüssel, how very happy we are that you got your own way, so that many Council meetings will now be made accessible to the public."
"Our group has always fought very hard for this, and during Mr Blair’s Presidency we confronted him very clearly with this wish."
"Once we even greeted him with placards as he entered this Chamber."
"He wanted to ignore us, but did not succeed."
"We welcome it all the more that you have resisted British pressure and that you have enforced the principle that transparency will now prevail - for it is the citizens’ right to see who says what or who decides things in their name."
"This transparency is an important precondition for trust in the European institutions."
"That the Council has not, however, dealt with the European Parliament’s concern – namely the Strasbourg question – this is, to put it bluntly, a disappointment."
"Using a letter to dismiss this – admittedly very difficult – issue just testifies once again to remoteness from ordinary citizens."
"It is a clear admission of failure, too, that the two largest groups immediately submit."
"The citizens’ initiative www.oneseat.eu continues."
"In just over four weeks on this website, more than 600 000 Europeans have signed their names and called for just one seat for Parliament."
"We also regret that there has been no progress on deregulation."
"The stipulated joint programming, whereby the institutions say together what should be done, has been blocked by the Council – even though it would be a step towards transparency and responsibility."
"These so-called concordance tables – another piece of EU jargon - have also been blocked by the Council, even though they would show precisely what is to be expected."
"They would let people know what was decided in Brussels, and what the national governments add on top – a very important step."
"Europe may have become calmer, but hopefully not too calm, because it must be heard so that the citizens can enter into a dialogue with it."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency and Chancellor Schüssel."
"Although we are often in disagreement, I must acknowledge your friendliness, as well as the approachability and courtesy of your staff."
"Contrary to the view expressed by Mr Poettering, I am convinced that the experience gained in 2000 served to strengthen the European ethos of your government and that it was an important experience not only for yourself but also for the whole of Europe."
"In this connection – I refer back to the question of human rights – I should also like to request that you remind President Bush, when you next meet him, about the problem of the CIA flights."
"You have not discussed the subject with us; I should like to know whether you will discuss it with him instead."
"I should now like to examine this Europe of results, which you have spoken about and which Mr Barroso has also mentioned."
"We gave a warm welcome, at the beginning of your Presidency, to your proposals and the enthusiasm you showed for the Constitution."
"What results do we see today?"
"We find ourselves in a period of limbo and prolonged silence, with a Presidency that, contrary to its mandate, has not submitted an interim report nor sketched out a ‘road map’ with constructive contents."
"All this has contributed – let us not hide the facts – to the transformation of the main Parliamentary forum into a pleasant talk show."
"At this juncture I should like to make an appeal to my fellow Members."
"It emerges from this Council’s conclusions that no involvement of our citizens or associations is envisaged concerning the proposal submitted by the governments."
"I fear in part the solemnity of the March meeting."
"Let me remind all of you that no crowds gathered in Rome on 29 October to celebrate the signing of the European Constitution."
"I do not want this declaration, like other things, to remain just a matter between ourselves, and I do not want us to often find ourselves discussing Europe in something of a vacuum."
"We must stop waiting for the governments to act and take note that the national parliaments for their part, or rather their leaders, sometimes seem more interested in protecting their own privileges than in playing for the European team."
"We must stop sheltering behind the ratifications: everyone, including Mr Schüssel, is now talking about modifying the text."
"We are the only ones not doing so."
"We must instead draw up a clear proposal in order to meet the next deadlines."
"Mr President, I am very sorry to tell you too that this Presidency will be remembered for an unprecedented increase in the European budget for research into nuclear power, with the result that a continent almost entirely lacking in non-renewable energy sources has decided to favour, with investments four or five times higher than before, a dangerous type of technology rather than confronting the problem of energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"This does not seem to me to be an impressive result for the Austrian Presidency."
"You have also mentioned the Brenner tunnel, though we would frankly have found the ratification of the Convention on the Protection of the Alps and the Protocol on Transport much more useful."
"I know that you tried in vain to convince the former Italian Government about this and I hope that you will have more success in this final week with the present government."
"Concerning sustainable development, it seems to me that the sole feature of the Council conclusions is a wearisome repetition of objectives, already stated and restated – objectives that unfortunately have not been met – and that little is said about practical measures that should instead be taken."
"Moreover, the exceedingly timid reference concerning the ecological footprint and the commitment to reduce our consumption of resources by 3% per year has been removed from the conclusions."
"All this, Mr President, is completely in line with the policy of the Barroso-Verheugen duo who, unless they adopt a different line of conduct, are in danger one day of receiving the ‘Attila the Hun Prize’ for Europe."
"One more thing, Mr President, very quickly: it is not true that immigration was discussed for the first time at the last European Council."
"I should like to point out the very important Council in Tampere and the one in Seville; positive, not merely repressive, measures to deal with immigration were discussed at both of these."
"I should like to point out that the only way of truly confronting and solving the problem of immigration at European level is to conclude agreements with third countries."
"We need to help them to escape from under-development, as well as define clear European policies for legal immigration into our continent."
"That is the only route to take."
"– Mr President, there is at least one decision with which the last Council has obviously made history in a small way, and that is the decision to hold codecision procedure meetings in public in future."
"I think this is a good decision; it is one that we support and it should actually increase transparency among the institutions."
"It is an important step and it should be supported by many people, precisely in this difficult period in which the EU finds itself."
"However, I do ask myself why the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States themselves try to frustrate this intention, by making announcements to the citizens of the EU that are precisely the opposite of thoughtfulness, insight or correctives to previous policies."
"The conclusions of the Presidency, under the headings ‘Europe listens’, ‘Europe at work’ and ‘Looking to the future’, are as follows."
"I know I am exaggerating here, but that is indeed my intention: firstly, Europe means those who govern the European Union, not the citizens of the EU and not all the people who live in the EU; secondly, those who govern continue the same policies and implement existing policies under the motto ‘faster, further, better’; and thirdly, looking to the future is understood as conforming with the challenges of globalisation and demographic change and successfully implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"These conclusions are hardly surprising, but they are not very helpful as a step-by-step solution to the backlog of problems in the European Union."
"On the contrary, precisely these intentions will make the social, environmental and global problems even worse."
"I would very much like to remind you of the European Services Directive: in our view, it is a sell-out and it does not achieve what you claimed a short while ago."
"Especially alarming is the fact that, under the subheading ‘Promoting freedom, security and justice’, most of the measures aim at more surveillance, more repression, more protective bulwarks or rather Fortress Europe, and the implementation of a migration policy whose central priority is to treat people like economic goods."
"The Council’s response to the tragedies involving refugees in the Mediterranean is to set up so-called ‘rapid border intervention teams’, a term that seems to imply - particularly in English - sending in commando troops against refugees."
"Just as alarming is the fact that, under the further subheading ‘Promoting the European way of life in a globalised world’, an out-of-date energy policy is bound up with the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy in such a way that others in the world could feel threatened by this."
"Now this certainly proves very well that those in power do not consider sustainable development to be the democratic resolution of social, environmental and global problems."
"The meeting of the European Council has, however, in my view made it just as clear that the period of reflection has not in any way been used to identify the reasons why the Constitution was rejected in the referendums in France and in the Netherlands, let alone to react to this in some way."
"I think that a different type of politics and a different basic substance must emerge clearly, from the Constitution."
"I find this lack of action arrogant and it will not be accepted by many citizens."
"Of course the year has been used to continue cheerfully with the development of the internal market for armaments and to progress in matters of surveillance, repression and protective barriers."
"The way in which worthy preparations are now made for the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome should make us think."
"Rather than turning it into just another festival, we should be using this special occasion to give real thought to the future, together with our fellow citizens."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I want to put on record my thanks to Chancellor Schüssel, to Secretary-of-State Winkler and to all the Ministers and the Permanent Representative from Austria for their tremendous work over the last six months."
"As you can see, Chancellor, despite the fact that you took on board some of the ideas Parliament spoke about; despite the fact that you included parliamentarians with regard to decision-making; you still get criticised for not being here enough or for not doing enough within Parliament."
"However, being familiar with parliamentary democracy yourself, you know that eaten bread is soon forgotten and it is good to hold back some of the spicy and sugary stuff until the very end of the Presidency!"
"When we look at the Council meeting and the results from it, there have been some successes."
"However, the most important area which has been outlined during the Austrian Presidency has been one of realism, of doing things that are achievable, of not ignoring problems that are there and trying to build a consensus to try and solve them, as well as taking the sensible attitude that this cannot be solved just in six months."
"It requires a longer approach; it requires more involvement of other presidencies; it requires more involvement of other Member States."
"I think that one of the biggest difficulties that we face within the European Union is when we speak about speaking to citizens, when we talk about speaking to citizens in Parliament, who is best placed to speak to the citizens?"
"Who has the best capacity to ensure citizens understand exactly what is happening at a European level?"
"With all due respect to the oratorical elegance and linguistic ability of the President of the Commission, and all of my colleagues within the groups here in Parliament, I would be useless speaking to a German audience with regard to what Europe does for them."
"But I am convinced that I can bring the majority of Irish people on board with me, and in every other Member State it is the same thing."
"Irish representatives, Finnish representatives, German representatives, Austrian representatives, French representatives must speak to people to tell them what is required."
"But they must speak with honesty, not using double-speak or with forked tongues."
"We have already seen that in France and in Holland during the referendums on the Constitution."
"People were throwing out ideas saying the Services Directive was going to destroy the European social model – a complete lie!"
"A lie that was perpetrated by people simply for political means."
"Now I have no difficulty with having a political argument on ideology with anybody."
"But if we are going to speak about the future of Europe, then that future has to be based on honesty, on facts."
"I think one of the biggest dangers that we face for the future is that we have failed our citizens and failed our people in terms of telling them exactly how successful Europe has been, how good it has been for them not only in peace, stability and prosperity, but also in bringing about political stability, in ensuring equality between men and women, in guaranteeing minimum rights for workers, minimum rights for people who are most in need and most at risk within our societies."
"We still have more to do, but at least we have made a positive start to it."
"The last point that I would make is that we should avoid using the – Article 42."
"I know it is an important issue for President Barroso and for others to try to move away from unanimity where it is not possible to get it, but if you do that you further alienate not only governments, but the people as well: people who see Europe as an autocratic body trying to force its own will on others."
", Mr President, I would very much like to thank the President of the Commission and Chancellor Schüssel for their help in enabling Denmark and Austria to retain their bans on fluorinated greenhouse gases, and I would like to thank all my numerous fellow MEPs who, last Tuesday, voted in favour of the groundwater rules also taking the form of a minimum directive."
"Total harmonisation should much more often become minimum harmonisation, so that countries are encouraged to go further in the fight for security, health and the environment."
"It is also some small degree of progress that codecision in the Council will from now on occur in public."
"Last year, out of a total of 3 124 laws, the EU adopted 57 laws in this way."
"What we are managing to get done in public is thus still only the tip of the iceberg."
"The general principle will continue to be that the EU adopts its laws in 300 secret Council working parties, assisted by 3 000 other secret working parties under the auspices of the Commission."
"The national parliaments get to decide about the principle of subsidiarity."
"Seize the opportunity – allow COSAC to deal with the annual programme until October."
"That was the praise; now for the criticism."
"In my opinion, Chancellor Schüssel should be ashamed of calling for the ratification of a Constitution that has been rejected by the people of the Netherlands and of France."
"Why does he not dare ask his own Austrian people what they think of the Constitution?"
"Why is Finland now to ratify a text that only 22% of Finns support, while 48% are against it?"
"EU Heads of State or Government, be warned – you are heading for a confrontation with the peoples of Europe."
"Choose yourselves some new populations instead; or start afresh with a convention directly elected to draw up new texts that can then be put to referendums in every country on the same day."
"That way, it is the citizens who decide."
"That way, there are no longer closed meetings, like in North Korea, Cuba and COREPER."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, you have asked us to say , and to display a little more joy."
"That is something we Alemannians can welcome too, even though people say that when we want to laugh we go into the cellar to do it."
"However, please let me respond to your musical allusion with a literary quotation."
"I do not know what you have just shared with the important people in this Chamber, but I would say ‘I hear the message well, but lack Faith’s constant trust’. You know, of course, to beware joy if it stems from repression or denial, because fake joy can make you lose all grip on reality and can then lead to political depression."
"That is even worse than ."
"What does the closing balance look like?"
"We are dealing with the greatest peacetime redistribution in human history."
"A great deal has been promised."
"What has actually changed?"
"You yourself mentioned the issue of the referendums."
"What has become of those?"
"Now we no longer hear about them."
"There is also silence on the question of the European Union’s absorption capacity, as well as on the question of transparency."
"You yourself said here on 18 January that the amount of money wasted on many programmes is lamentable and that there are remedies for this, namely inspections."
"Such information should be published, and the right thing to do would be to publish details of subsidies that have been awarded."
"Yet there is also silence on this matter now."
"In the meantime, I have raised two parliamentary questions on this issue."
"What do your friends at Raiffeisen get, what does the ORF get, what do the others get?"
"Silence is the opposite of transparency, and without transparency there is no democracy."
"There has been no answer: all there has been is silence, silence, silence, silence, silence, silence and more silence."
"Silence leads to stillness and stillness leads to a standstill."
"That will not do."
"By the way - and I am sure even you have got wind of this - the Austrian Presidency seems to have acquired the kind of reputation that goes with the nickname , ‘the blow-out meal’."
"That will not do either."
"There can only be real joy if we have democracy, controls and justice, and so let us see how far these values can take us."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, if we review the last two Council Presidency debates, all that can be said is 'the comparison makes us certain'."
"If, a year ago, we repeatedly emphasised how great a crisis we were in, and if, six months ago, we rejected the results of the Presidency by a two-thirds' majority, we now all agree that, at the end of these six months, the European Union is more successful and in a better position than at the end of 2005."
"Today, we are taking stock in the knowledge that not everything can be achieved in six months, in the knowledge that much is still unfinished, and in the knowledge that we still have much work to do."
"However, we are all of the opinion that the glass is half full, not half empty."
"The question also arises of whether the Presidency of the Council has been successful in its efforts to improve the quality of cooperation with the European Parliament and the institutions."
"The answer is yes, and the proof is before us – the considerable presence, the quality of the leadership, the financial perspective and the Services Directive – and, Mr Schulz, not only for the Austrians but also for us Christian Democrats there was never any question of choosing between the neoliberal and the social, because our values mean we have always been committed to the social market economy."
"The comitology, the foreign policy financial instruments, the connection with the informal Council meetings, the expansion of Question Time and the ministers for specific remits, the four conferences between the national parliaments, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – these are just some of the facts."
"Our cooperation was successful, and it should continue in this vein."
"However, I should also like to say this: we have always been successful when we have put the community of Europe at the heart of our work and have not reduced the European Union to the work of government."
"In the wake of this successful cooperation between the institutions, we have also got the citizens more deeply involved in this new cooperative approach."
"I should also like, on behalf of my Group and my delegation, to thank all the ministers, all the civil servants and, in particular, Mr Winkler and Mr Woschnagg for their excellent cooperation with all the Members of this House."
"The other question, too – Croatia, Turkey, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria – have demonstrated one thing: we are now following the rules more closely, and glossing over things less."
"In the spirit of the World Cup, I would say that, after years of own goals and defensive play, the team has rediscovered its form."
"We are attacking again."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, I too am grateful for the strong presence of the Austrian Presidency here in the European Parliament and for the good cooperation with you, your colleagues in government and all those involved."
"I should particularly like to single out Secretary-of-State Winkler."
"He has not just been a man for all seasons, but also a man for all times of the day and night – particularly for the late-night sittings here in the European Parliament."
"On the Austrian Presidency's balance sheet, the social aspect is, for me, obviously in the foreground."
"On the assets side, the conclusion of the Services Directive is certainly a major plus point to which the European Parliament, as has repeatedly been stressed, also made an important contribution."
"I think, however, that there are also some minus points to be seen if one looks at the financial perspective: for example, one of the biggest cuts has been to the European Social Fund, of all things, there has been no progress on the Working Time Directive, and the targets at the Spring Summit with regard to employment figures were so modest that they have already been overtaken by reality."
"Perhaps that is now the Council's new tactic – to set such modest, or as some would say realistic, targets and to set the benchmark so low that it is practically impossible to stumble over it."
"There is a negative mark in the ecological balance sheet, namely the infrastructure costs directive."
"Here, too, the European Parliament served the Presidency a very good ball, but unfortunately Vice-Chancellor Gorbach did not catch it, and the European Parliament's attitude, which was more favourable for Austria as well, could not be transferred to the Council."
"We have heard nothing at all about other subjects: particularly in women's policy, equality policy and development policy, there has been a real lack of initiatives."
"On the question of the Constitution, there was nothing more that the Austrian Presidency could achieve."
"What concerned me a little was the fact that, through the special events, priority has been given almost exclusively to the subsidiarity principle."
"All of us who took part in those events now have a better idea of what Europe should not do."
"What we still do not know, though, is what Europe can do to really solve its problems."
"Mr President, beyond Chancellor Schüssel’s bonhomie, I think we can sense his frustration at the problem of shepherding 25 fairly feline characters towards agreeing a mandate for a fresh intergovernmental conference."
"Now that you are becoming freer from the constraints of the Presidency, Chancellor Schüssel, would you wish to push forward the debate by sharing with us your top priorities as subjects, as chapters for renegotiation inside Part III?"
"Mr President, Chancellor, Commissioner, the most significant issue during the Austrian Presidency was the agreement on new economic guidelines for the period 2007–2013."
"This was achieved by using the Commission and Parliament as dishcloths to wipe the table clean."
"European Commission President Barroso’s empty rhetoric did not work."
"Also evident in Barroso’s speeches on the EU Constitution is a lack of credibility."
"Perhaps you could say as much to Mr Barroso, Commissioner Rehn."
"The Commission’s plan ‘D’ is just that: propaganda, agitating and wheedling from top to bottom."
"It would have been democratic if the EU Constitution had been pronounced dead."
"That would have been the kind of democracy we associate with the agreement of a state."
"The Constitution had to be adopted in all the Member States by common consent."
"The opposite of democracy with the agreement of a state is dictatorship by a majority."
"The EU’s political elite and eurocracy are bad losers."
"You are bad losers, Mr Austria, Mr Commission and you too, Mr Parliament."
"You are trying to resurrect a dead constitution; you are asking the Member States to ratify something which will never come into force."
"You are also asking the same of my country, Finland, where, according to an opinion poll, only 22% of the nation are in favour of ratification of the EU Constitution in Parliament."
"Shame on you, you opponents of state democracy, who act with a 22% minority!"
"As a positive aspect of the summit, we note the new transparency of the Councils and comitology."
"The decision shows that we do not need more in the way of a constitution to improve democracy, but more democratic will."
"Greater transparency equals better democracy."
"Mr Schüssel, Mr President, I should like to offer my warmest congratulations both to the Council Summit, and to the Austrian Presidency on its work."
"A great many European politicians have their heads in the clouds – constitutional clouds, one might say – which sometimes means that they are unwilling to appreciate the long list of issues successfully dealt with by the European Union."
"These include the budget, the Services Directive, the development of cooperation on domestic matters, improved consular cooperation, enlargement of the Schengen area and reform of the EU’s external policies, which is the matter closest to my own heart and which is very close to completion, thanks to Mr Schüssel’s team in Brussels."
"This list amounts to a great deal."
"I do not agree with all these decisions, but I am delighted that they have been taken."
"Having experienced how effective the EU can be, we should refrain from criticising the Treaty of Nice too harshly, for it is all we have in the way of a Treaty system."
"Europe functions, and indeed functions very well without a Constitutional Treaty, and proof of this can be seen in the Presidency that is drawing to a close."
"This experience should be the main premise behind an entirely new reform of the Treaty system."
"Instead of having its head in the clouds surrounding the Constitution, this reform should have a firm foundation of European experience and European practice, such as that demonstrated by the Presidency that is now coming to an end."
"I should like to express my warm thanks in this respect."
"Mr President, we are in the process of summing up the six-month Austrian Presidency."
"What exactly has it achieved?"
"It boasts that it has achieved a compromise on the Services Directive."
"Yet instead of guaranteeing genuine free movement of services within the EU, the regulation that has come into being is incomplete and imprecise."
"Europe’s chance of seeing an improvement in the external competitiveness of its economy has been squandered."
"Secondly, the Presidency has brought about the adoption of the new Financial Perspective for the period 2007-2013."
"One of the consequences of this Financial Perspective as it stands is ever-increasing cuts to spending under the EU budget on key objectives, such as territorial cohesion and the creation of a level playing field in terms of development opportunities for the poorest regions."
"Finally, let us turn to the ill-fated draft Constitutional Treaty, which has been a dead duck for some time now."
"The Austrian Chancellor said during the summit, and has confirmed today, that the main content of the Treaty must remain intact."
"Such a statement disregards the will of the citizens of at least two EU Member States."
"It is likely that the longest-lasting and most spectacular outcome of the Austrian Presidency will be multicoloured barcodes on mass-produced EU knick-knacks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the Austrian Presidency is in essence a Europe of results, ranging from the achievements in controlling immigration to the revival of the role of small and medium-sized enterprises and the involvement of the national parliaments in European integration."
"It was high time we remembered the fundamental role of the national parliaments, which represent democracy in the Member States: they are the voice of democracy."
"This is a Presidency that, among other things, is concluding its term of office with a piece of good news for those of us who support autonomy and regionalism."
"The Austrian Presidency has also given a signal to that effect, with the revival of regional status and of a less homogeneous Europe – as witnessed by the positive result of the referendum on the independence of Catalonia."
"Mr Schüssel has given us positive guidelines concerning the fundamental role of small and medium-sized enterprises: he has described them as part of Europe’s hidden potential."
"They should be supported not only for their research but also for their demands for the abolition of many bureaucratic obstacles."
"As for the Brussels summit, I should like to point out that we have unfortunately not been able to reach a final agreement on one of the fundamental issues facing us, that of future enlargements, in part because of the unstable position of some governments, the Italian Government included."
"Rather, as Chancellor Schüssel rightly said this morning, the accession criteria should be made precise and concrete; they should not remain pure rhetoric."
"In this connection, Mr D’Alema’s invitation to Members not to assume a dogmatic attitude on this matter is open to criticism."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure for me, on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues and as Internal Market Committee coordinator for the PPE-DE Group, to thank the Austrian Presidency for what I think has been a Presidency of real substance and real achievement – I have to say in contrast to their predecessors in the previous six months."
"The characteristic of this Presidency, Chancellor Schüssel, has been that you have been essentially realistic."
"You have not overpromised, but you have got on and delivered."
"I think the Services Directive has perhaps been the best example of that."
"Your colleague Martin Bartenstein, who I have got to know very well over the last six months, was quoted in the in December saying that it would be a miracle if you achieved agreement on the Services Directive during your Presidency."
"Well, there is a remarkable piece of underpromising and overdelivery!"
"That miracle has been achieved by a lot of work between us in this Parliament."
"I have to say to Mr Schulz, who I was astonished to hear just now claiming that the Services Directive appeared to be a triumph of orthodoxy, that miracle was actually achieved by serious work to produce a liberalising free market directive."
"In fact, the central clause that unlocked the agreement – the freedom to provide services – came as a result of the committee vote in this Parliament, which was contested by the Socialists."
"So, let us be clear about what the Services Directive is going to deliver."
"It is a major step forward for the internal market."
"Finally, Chancellor Schüssel, it has been most welcome to see your approach to opening up the Council as regards codecision and in inviting parliamentarians to your meetings."
"I am very disappointed that my own Foreign Secretary has apparently been against this transparency."
"All I would say to Mr Schulz is that, when I sat round the table in Graz and heard the approach of the 25 ministers on the Services Directive, it was most certainly not because they felt that it was a triumph for socialism."
"– Mr President, I have to tell Mr Harbour that appearance and reality are often not the same."
"I wish to thank, above all, the staff of the various ministries, who have done an extraordinary amount of work and really have made a great deal of progress possible."
"I hope that you will be able not only to keep the best of them, but also to find more for them to do."
"In my first speech, Mr Federal Chancellor, I raised with you the issue of minorities in Carinthia, which is a European problem, and I am much obliged to you for coming up with a proposal that constitutes a considerable step forward."
"I hope that it will also be possible to put this proposal into effect, and that eventually everyone – not least those who live in this province on the border with Slovenia – will recognise that, in Europe, multilingualism and diversity are winners rather than hindrances."
"There is no contradiction between the need for us to promote this multilingualism and this diversity in Europe and the need to make progress with the Constitution and move the constitutional process forward."
"I am very glad that a firm commitment has been made to this."
"I am all in favour of enlargement, but if we are to take it further – and there are those who are already, today, acting as if Ukraine is going to be a Member State of the European Union within the next few years – then it also has to be ensured that Europe is capable of sustaining such an enlargement."
"It is those very persons who want this to happen who must make it their business to ensure that we end up with a constitutional process that also results in a definite strengthening of the European Union, for this constitutional process is not an obstacle to future enlargement, but rather the precondition that it should happen at all."
"I would like to say something else about Turkey and Croatia."
"I am very glad that we have made a start on the negotiations."
"Where Croatia was concerned, that was long overdue, but, as regards Turkey, let me – as one who has always argued in favour of negotiations being commenced with that country – make something clear: as Mr Schulz has already said, our expectation of Turkey is that it should actually discharge all those obligations to which it has committed itself, and that includes the recognition of Cyprus and the opening of harbours and airports."
"I am, of course, also in favour of the Greek Cypriot Government, that is to say the Government of Cyprus, doing everything in its power to pave the way for the Turkish-speaking population to share in a single state and hence in the European Union."
"If both sides – the governments in Nicosia and Ankara respectively – really want progress, then it can happen, but, quite apart from that, Turkey must discharge all those obligations to which it has committed itself, and there have been quite a few utterances from Mr Erdogan that had been better left unsaid."
"Mr President, the new buzz-phrase ‘absorption capacity’ has filled newspaper columns all over Europe."
"What does this phrase actually mean?"
"Is it just a codeword for ‘Operation Stop Turkey’?"
"Does it not show an exceptional lack of leadership and a failure to support and explain the advantages of enlargement?"
"We can see, after all, that trade, growth and consumption have all risen since May 2004."
"Stability and democracy have been strengthened, and Europe is better equipped to face our common problems."
"Expansion must not be used as a scapegoat."
"Political leadership means forming, leading and shaping opinion."
"I welcome the moves to increase openness made at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels, but I regret that the question of the seat of the European Parliament was not raised."
"This matter is an important question of credibility for the whole of the EU and it needs to be discussed in the course of the upcoming overhaul of the Treaties."
"So far, over 610 000 people from all over Europe have signed the citizens’ initiative for there to be a single seat for the European Parliament."
"If you ask the people for their opinion, you must also listen to what they say."
"Chancellor Schüssel, have you signed the proposal?"
"– Mr President, Mr Federal Chancellor, I would like to follow on from Mr Swoboda’s contribution."
"Putting up 158 sign posts in Carinthia is a first step, a small obligation based on a supreme court verdict and the terms of the 1955 treaty."
"Much more generosity is, however, due to this small and ever decreasing Slovenian minority."
"Austria should show the same understanding towards its own minority as for the Southern Tyroleans, the German-Italian minority in Italy."
"One more word on the Brenner Base tunnel project: it is proving to be a bottomless pit for taxpayers’ money."
"We need to alter our transport policy."
"Without this, the railway will not stand a chance."
"We need to improve our existing railways before embarking on isolated projects on such a huge scale."
"Mr President, last week in Strasbourg, I condemned the brazen contempt that we show for public opinion, for the views of voters and for democracy itself when we repeatedly disregard the verdict of successive referendums."
"Nowhere is this contempt for democracy better illustrated than by the actions of the Austrian Presidency."
"Both the Austrian President and Chancellor Schüssel have come to this house calling for the resurrection of a European Constitution which is dead in its own terms."
"Yet, as Eurobarometer studies show, Austria is the Member State where opposition to the Constitution is the highest, at around 80%."
"Chancellor Schüssel, you have called for referendums on the Constitution, so why do you not offer a referendum to your own people?"
"Can it be because you know you would suffer a humiliating defeat?"
"How can Austrian leaders show such total disregard for public opinion?"
"I can only think of one plausible explanation: perhaps Chancellor Schüssel is unhappy in his job and is hoping that the Austrian people will vote him out of office!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard from the representative of the Vienna Congress."
"Our colleague has settled in over this period."
"Mr Schüssel, if we look at the facts it is clear that you have had a remarkably successful Presidency of the Council."
"The Financial Perspective, the final shape given to the new REACH chemicals policy, the Services Directive, new initiatives on asylum and migration - none of these was a foregone conclusion."
"It might almost be thought that your success contradicts the assertion that we need a Constitutional Treaty to enable us to act, because you have proved that there might also be other ways of proceeding."
"However, I do not share this opinion at all."
"I would like to remind you once more that we began work on the proposed ‘Constitutional Treaty’ when we were in the process of accepting ten, twelve or more new Member States and wanted, by means of this project, to make the Union not only more capable of taking action but also more democratic and more transparent."
"Had we achieved this in good time and, for instance, arranged for competences to be defined in the manner described in the draft Constitutional Treaty, then the people of the Netherlands and France might not have voted against the Treaty."
"I would like now, Mr Schüssel, to ask a leading question: are you sure that the Heads of State or Government would be as willing to sign up to the Treaty today as they were then?"
"I am not sure quite how far the consensus that binds us in principle and according to which we need a new set of rules will be maintained."
"I think we still need to revise our ideas."
"Europe obviously needs borders, and not just of the geographical variety."
"Just a word about Turkey: how long does the Council really want to be held to ransom by the Turkish Government over tariff union agreements."
"The public are aware of what is going on, and it is unacceptable."
"I join those who have thanked the Austrian Presidency for the process that has been planned, for those parts that have been implemented, and I would also like to thank Mr Winkler personally."
"Mr Chancellor, I trust that all this abundant praise will not harm Mr Winkler, but I must say that it has been a pleasure working with him."
"In respect of the Constitution, I would like to thank you for the extremely determined redirection of the process, from the planning of a funeral service for an allegedly defunct project towards the planning of further work."
"There is no point in debating these clumsy rather than true statements, but it is worth asking the often mentioned question: have we done enough for citizens to feel that the European Community is not only a strict supervisor who punishes and always provides insufficient funds, and to understand that the power of the European Union is behind the joys that we experience in our lives, and it also represents our common future?"
"National parliaments and national governments, too, have a huge responsibility in this respect."
"This joint responsibility must be revived and strengthened."
"I was very pleased to see that the disclosure of the true social conditions in the European Union and the tasks required to move forward were presented in such a prominent place in the starting programme of the Council."
"I have to say that today we are still, more or less, in the same position, because the President of the Commission spoke of integrated effect assessment and the evaluation of the social effects of the laws."
"Therefore, I ask you to ensure that we do not focus only on equal opportunities between the sexes, but also on those who live in deprived areas, the elderly population of Europe, those who became or were forced to become marginalised, the Roma and the immigrants, and the poor children."
"Their rights are the rights of Europe, and we need the Constitution to ensure this."
"For fifty years the Slovene ethnic minority in the Austrian part of Carinthia has waited for the implementation of Article 7 of the Vienna State Treaty, and now that Austria holds the presidency of the European Union, the time has finally come to implement at least some of the rights secured for the Slovene minority in the Constitution, principally that of bilingual topography."
"These issues are being resolved at present, but are currently in violation of a number of international minority protection standards."
"The 10/15 formula does not implement the judgments of the Constitutional Court of Austria."
"A compromise solution may be to initiate rather than terminate the legal protection of the Slovene minority."
"This is precisely the objective: to resolve the issue of bilingual topography once and for all."
"Raising the profile of such a compromise to the level of constitutional law would, in practice, abolish Article 7 of the Vienna State Treaty and prevent its unilateral revision and any breaches of international law."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a presidency need not be spectacular in order to be successful."
"Austria has proven that plenty of foresight, realism, consultation and commitment are evidently all that is needed in order to be successful on many fronts, and that deserves credit."
"An agreement has been reached on the financial perspectives."
"Being disappointed with the level of the budgets, but happy with the quality of the outcome of the negotiations, we were able to vote in favour of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Mr Schüssel, you dedicated much of your time to completing the internal market, particularly with the Services Directive."
"In that respect, your ministers have inspired us to take the bull by the horns."
"We can now look forward to an even-handed Services Directive, which is what we all set out to achieve."
"In addition, an agreement has been reached on comitology, and, in our group at any rate, it has not had a bad reception; another thing that is important to mention is the fact that, under your aegis, the Council has managed to keep the constitution alive; if we have any kind of constitutional treaty by the time of the elections in 2009, then some of the credit for that should certainly go to you."
"I have one question in respect of the summit conclusions."
"Whilst the issue of absorption capacity may be mentioned in the chapter on enlargement, it is not really flagged as a condition for future enlargements."
"Could you say more about this, or is there as yet no position and are we to wait for the Commission’s document?"
"Finally, I should like to congratulate you on the decision in favour of transparency in the Council’s decision-making."
"Hours of on-going uncertainty about the Belgian Government's voting behaviour when determining the common position on the Services Directive perfectly demonstrates the need for this."
"We support this wholeheartedly."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office; it was a real joy for this House to be working with the whole of your team."
"– Mr President, despite the satisfaction and, in certain instances, the self-satisfaction which prevailed following the summit, it is becoming clear that the 25 endeavoured to manage the collective embarrassment which the institutional crisis and the impasse concerning the fate of the Constitutional Treaty continues to provoke."
"I fear that the dual approach adopted – and that is not the responsibility of the Austrian Presidency; the problem is a more collective one for the European Union – is nothing but an ordinary attempt to buy time or, to use a topical football analogy, the 25 are playing for time by throwing the ball at the stand until there are better conditions."
"How can we be certain, Mr Schüssel, that conditions will be better in 2008?"
"Simply because the government in France will have changed?"
"I understand that you want there to be a climate of optimism, but I ask you: today, after the conclusions of the European Council, have the scepticism and concerns of the citizens of Europe decreased?"
"I agree with the objectives set for a Europe of programmes, but how can we be sure about the positive repercussions from the integration of the single internal market, when no reference is made to the need for social and fiscal harmonisation and when no reference is made to the need to deepen economic union at the same time as monetary union?"
"How can the European Central Bank decide to increase interest rates when both governments and ministries of finance have expressed their opposition?"
"Serious concerns and confusion are also arising in connection with the enlargement strategy for the Balkans."
"I fear greatly that this confusion has increased in relation to the capacity to absorb it."
"Mr President, my thanks go to Austria;"
"Chancellor Schüssel and his orchestra are knowledgeable in EU-related matters."
"Under the leadership of Austria, the Services Directive has provided a solution based largely on the results of voting in Parliament."
"The solution was not actually expected from Austria, but it is a good thing that it has happened."
"It is balanced, workable and surely better than the original proposal for a directive."
"The European Union should move forward in matters of the single market and the economy, if Europe as an economic area wants to succeed in global competition and provide its citizens with jobs."
"Increased transparency is a good thing, but the decision that has now been made is just a small step and a beginning, but by no means enough, and not yet an end product."
"In my opinion, the decisions by COREPER and the explanations for them should also be announced ..."
"Mr Chairman, I would like to make three points."
"The first is that I think the Austrian Presidency was a very successful one."
"In order to have a successful presidency you need three things: one, you need to prepare well; two, you need to be objective; and three, you need a little bit of luck."
"And I think you had all of those three things, Chancellor Schüssel."
"You all know that it is not the presidency that makes the agenda, it is the agenda that makes the presidency."
"If I can make a recommendation, in 1999, you co-chaired with Finland."
"You will do it again."
"Neither one of us made it to the World Cup; perhaps we can try sending out a joint team the next time around, because we seem to work quite well together."
"My second point is that I think you and the Presidency have pushed the constitutional debate into a new phase."
"You say, ‘we go from reflection to action’; I say we go from reflection to analysis."
"We will get a proposal during the German and Portuguese presidencies, and we might even do a little bit of renegotiation during the Slovenian and the French presidencies."
"But, may I make just one careful proposal – and I am doing so under the close observation of my group chairman and of Mr Daul."
"We had the Dutch Presidency pushing through the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, and the Nice Treaty being pushed through by the French Presidency."
"If some people want to change the name of the constitution and we finish those negotiations in 2008 during the French Presidency, why do we not call it the Treaty of Strasbourg?"
"How is that for symbolism?"
"I am just floating the idea."
"Think about it!"
"The final point I wanted to make is that I think we need to move from a time of euro-pessimism towards euro-optimism."
"Let us stop whining and blaming."
"Let us start working and looking at the bigger picture."
"We are actually doing quite well."
"With these words I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency and welcome the Finnish Presidency."
"Mr President, the Austrian Presidency has been marked by numerous initiatives and challenges on gender issues."
"Political agreement was reached on the draft regulation establishing the European Institute for Gender Equality, and conclusions on the review of the implementation by the Member States and the EU institutions of the Beijing Platform for Action and on women’s health have been adopted."
"The roadmap for gender equality was presented, which can be marked as a milestone and a concrete timetable for key actions on gender equality for the period 2006-2010."
"I welcome in particular the commitment to produce a communication on the gender pay gap next year."
"This is something on which PES Women, of which I am President, has done a lot of work. We need concrete actions."
"The legislation dates back to the 1970s but there has not been much progress."
"The average difference in the EU is still 16%."
"The grave situation as regards the trafficking of women has been put at the centre of attention in association with the FIFA World Cup."
"I have strongly welcomed the campaign launched by German women, showing the red card to forced prostitution and calling for cross-border cooperation in the promotion of the red card campaign, putting forward the idea of zero tolerance of trafficking throughout Europe."
"On the eve of the World Cup I handed over the final list of signatures to the anti-trafficking campaign to Commissioner Frattini."
"The largest trade union in Denmark handed over a similar petition with 80 000 signatures."
"The PSE Group collected 23 000 signatures calling for action by EU Member States to prevent the trafficking of women into Germany to work as prostitutes during the World Cup."
"Commissioner Frattini was asked to report back after the World Cup with an assessment of the scale of the problem and a summary of the actions taken."
"There is need for a real debate across Europe on tackling the root causes of trafficking for sexual exploitation, and that means looking for ways to reduce the demand for prostitution."
"The EU should intensify the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"Note that we are not going to stop pressing the EU to take this issue seriously."
"In conclusion, I wish the music of Mozart not just for the elite, but for all."
"Mr President, the reflection period has been more like a paralysis period, which is very reminiscent of the reaction of animals in the countryside when they are blinded by entirely unexpected glints of light."
"Schüssel is asking us to be cheerful, Barroso is asking us for confidence and more cheerful colours, but we need something more from them in order to give them what they are asking for."
"We need more realism in their diagnosis and more courage to face up to what is really necessary."
"You know what is needed."
"It seems clear that we have to wait until 2007 for the elections in a Member State in order to really start moving."
"However, we need to use the extensive possibilities offered by the current Treaties."
"In this sense, the movement towards transparency deserves all of the congratulations and we need to start working on realistic options."
"These realistic options do not include putting an old, completely dried out dish in the microwave and serving it again."
"We need to cook afresh, because if we just warm up a dish that no one can digest, indigestion will result in it being rejected even more than the first time it was served."
"Mr President, today I wish to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, and to Austria for having held the Presidency of the European Union in recent months."
"I should like to draw the House’s attention to three things."
"Firstly, the Austrian Presidency has helped to maintain transatlantic relations at a high level, and indeed to deepen relations between the European Union and the United States."
"It has been apparent that this has been one of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities."
"I should like to express my particular thanks to the Presidency for the part it has played in ensuring the success of the dialogue between the European Parliament and the US Congress, and in the excellent organisation of the meeting between delegations from the European Union and the United States in spring 2006 in Vienna."
"The second issue I should like to highlight is the fact that the Austrian Presidency took the monitoring of racism, xenophobia, homophobia and nationalism throughout the European Union as one of its priorities."
"This has indeed been one of the Presidency’s priorities, and there can be no doubt that, as far as Austria is concerned, the fight against such phenomena is one of the European Union’s key areas of action."
"The third issue to which I should like to draw the House’s attention is the enlargement dimension, which has been steered by this Presidency."
"I should like to express my thanks for the Presidency’s impartiality."
"It really can be said that Austria has held the Presidency without resorting to ideology or partisanship, and that it has instead reflected the majority opinion in the European Union."
"In some ways, one could say that it has represented the voice of the majority in the European Parliament."
"Above all, I have in mind the role played by the Austrian Presidency in appeasing enlargement-related sentiments and in encouraging moderation in this matter, as well as in ensuring that the enlargement of the European Union is still open to debate."
"Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, the balance sheet of the Austrian Presidency’s six-month term is positive, above all in respect of its political achievements."
"We have seen the last of the phase of Euro-pessimism, of that negative sentiment that the Romans called Today, European politics are looking ahead; despite the resistance of certain countries that emerged at last week’s European Council, we have resumed discussions of the operational project aimed at establishing the European Constitution."
"In this connection, I believe that Mr Poettering’s proposal must be welcomed by the Council and the Commission."
"Although the text signed in Rome will have to be modified in order to receive final approval, I agree with you: the substance of what is to be the European must not be changed."
"Without the Constitutional Treaty there will be no People’s Europe, nor a European Union capable of fulfilling its role."
"But what should this role be?"
"It should be based on the principle of subsidiarity, thus satisfying the demands of those citizens that cannot get adequate responses from their own governments and from local bodies."
"In this era of globalisation, the Member States, on their own, cannot solve the major issues relating to immigration, to the war on terrorism, to energy policy, to the liberalisation of the market and to the budget."
"It is therefore Europe’s task to confront these issues, which fortuitously are those that have been examined and, in some cases, resolved by your Presidency – which I genuinely consider to be the forerunner for subsequent presidencies called on to establish the Constitution, thanks also to the active support of the European Parliament."
"Chancellor, I should like in conclusion to appeal to you in your capacity as Austrian Chancellor: in the matter of stem cell research, please continue to defend the principle of subsidiarity and ethical values, the heritage of European civilisation."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is in better shape now than it was a year ago."
"However, it is not yet what we want it to be."
"There is still a long way to go, but it is in a better state than it was a year ago and it has shown itself capable of acting in certain areas."
"On 26 July we shall hopefully be able to add the foreign policy Financial Perspective to Austria’s achievements."
"Permit me to take this opportunity to offer sincere thanks in this connection to a pillar of European policy in Brussels, Ambassador Woschnagg."
"The Financial Perspective has been agreed, but we can see that, even on these kinds of issue, the veto principle leads only to a victory for the lowest common denominator."
"This reveals the weaknesses of our decision-making structures."
"I am thankful, Mr Schüssel, that we shall now have more transparency in the Council. We have fought for that."
"It still does not amount to the democracy and citizen’s rights encapsulated in the Constitution, but we can be thankful for the progress made."
"You have brought the Constitutional Treaty back on track."
"We can see new opportunities, and I am more optimistic today than I was six months ago."
"However, we need to talk about more than the substance."
"It must be made clear that no one is really bringing Parts I and II of the actual Constitution into question because they represent a balance which no one has so far formulated better."
"This should be our guiding principle in the debates in the months to come."
"With regard, in particular, to the internal orientation of the European Union in the light of the Constitutional Treaty, issues relating to Europe’s borders, its absorption capacity and such like have also, under this Presidency, been placed at the centre of the debate."
"The balance struck between these two aspects – internal structure and external borders – will be important to the future structure of Europe."
"This is something we need to debate."
"I hope that the necessary new approaches exist to enable us to advance further in these respects."
"If we do not make progress in these areas, we will end up with a smaller Europe, and that is something that none of us wants."
"We do not want Poland and other countries to assume second-class status in Europe."
"You are meeting the Americans today and tomorrow."
"Guantánamo is an important issue, but the United States and Europe are not bound by any treaty. Both, however, have treaties with other countries in the world."
"We need an institutional framework for relations between Europe and America."
"Perhaps we can set the ball rolling today."
"Mr President, I should like to address the issues briefly."
"Firstly, the issue of the US summit."
"I will start with this issue as it has been mentioned by several speakers."
"You are entirely right that we need to pay great attention to the transatlantic dialogue and its outcomes."
"If America and Europe work hand in hand rather than confronting each other, we can really get things moving."
"We are surely all aware of that."
"Notwithstanding legitimate critiques of American behaviour – to which we should not turn a blind eye - the American-European friendship and partnership is, moreover, an important foundation stone for the future."
"I am deeply convinced of this, and I want to express this conviction in this House, even if it may not be universally popular."
"We shall therefore lay several very important milestones at this summit."
"Firstly, an agreement whereby Europe and America will take up arms against product piracy on the basis of very specific concrete actions."
"We also want to collaborate on the energy question, this being an area in which the Americans are in fact ahead of us."
"In fact, when it comes to research into renewable energy carriers, the Americans are well ahead of us. Together we could get things moving, partly in the interests of the Kyoto objectives, climate protection and a lot more."
"Foreign policy is also important."
"The Near East, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan all constitute important issues, and it goes without saying that we are not losing sight of long-term goals such as a transatlantic free-trade zone and an overall treaty."
"You can be sure that the issues of human rights, Guantánamo and CIA overflights will naturally be discussed."
"I mentioned these matters personally during my visit to Washington in December."
"I also say this because, during the Austrian Presidency, we have begun a dialogue with legal experts - John Bellinger of the and, now, the Office of the Legal Advisor in Austria - on what is to be done in practical terms. It is a little-known fact that Hans Winkler was also one of the pioneers of this dialogue, and I agreed the proceedings with Mr Bush in December."
"The fact that there are gaps in international law is obvious."
"These gaps are being discussed quite intensively in America, with decisions being made by the highest courts."
"Yesterday’s Austrian ‘Standard’ published an interview with John Bellinger which I find very interesting."
"We have been able to eliminate some elements from the dispute that are of great importance to me, and I hope that tomorrow the situation will remain the same."
"There should be no part of the world in which human rights do not apply."
"There must be no torture, whatever the standard by which this is measured."
"There must be no abduction of persons and no detaining them in secret prisons or detention centres or whatever these might euphemistically be called."
"This must be expressed in the knowledge that at the same time - and we partly have the Americans to thank for this – we can and must do a great deal to export democracy, strengthen NGOs and strengthen civic or civil society."
"These issues are being discussed."
"Secondly, I turn to the subject of transparency."
"I really do not want to fight an Austrian election, because that is not my intention. It is interesting, however, that the Austrian Greens have all left the Chamber."
"To accuse me of not seeking dialogue with the people seems to me to be a little unfair, for the ‘Café d’Europe’ was really an attempt to become involved with everyday life."
"The fact is, the idea of Europe originated in the coffee houses."
"Europe was born in the coffee houses of Europe."
"Moreover, Europe is still being created in the cafés of Europe, where many writers, philosophers and journalists are continuing what Coudenhove-Kalergi started."
"To dismiss Europe as a project of the elite is, if you will pardon my saying so, simply unjustified."
"We are also exploiting the new media."
"I am surprised by the fact that our own website, ‘The future of Europe; Europe is listening’, has had eight million visitors."
"How many politicians have the opportunity to speak directly to eight million people?"
"We have also had 32 million visitors to the Presidency website."
"In fact, I think that we can do more and that we should have the confidence to do more."
"This has nothing to do with self-congratulation. It is simply about working in a professional way with the new media."
"I turn now to the subject of enlargement. This issue is very important to me, as, in 1998, I was the Austrian Foreign Minister and Council President when we began the enlargement process."
"It was sometimes an uphill struggle. Majority opinion in Austria was sometimes against me and my strategy."
"However, we remained steadfast and, today, we have, for example, in connection with what was the very contentious issue of the accession of the Czech Republic, a majority that is now pleased that that country joined the EU."
"I am very happy about this."
"That is to say, it is only right."
"It is just a question of standing up for enlargement, and Mr Rehn, who is investing a lot of time and energy in the matter, can confirm the need to make such a stand."
"Ten years ago, the wage and income differential between ourselves and the new Member States was 10:1."
"Today it is half that."
"This is a win-win situation."
"We can export, we have a virtual Hong Kong on our doorstep and we can profit from this impetus for growth."
"We just need to have faith in ourselves, to position ourselves well and to spread positive news rather than the usual negative rumours."
"The Turkish issue is also part of the overall picture."
"We must speak truthfully."
"I have fought hard to open negotiations with Turkey and also to bring this chapter to a conclusion."
"We need to be clear about one thing, however: obligations must be honoured."
"The obligations contained in the Ankara Protocol must be honoured in full, and, coming when they did, the statements of last week, which have been very disappointing for all those who have shown great commitment to the European route of binding Turkey to Europe, were an example of particularly bad timing on our part."
"I turn now to my last but one point: the Constitutional Treaty."
"Allow me to speak openly here."
"We need some new elements."
"This is obvious to everyone who feels affection for this painfully acquired child of European unity."
"We all know this."
"Forgive me, but I am not keen on the term ‘Constitutional Treaty’."
"It has, in any case, been a very peculiar compromise."
"What we have is neither a Constitution nor a Treaty, but a Constitutional Treaty."
"Let us give it another name, because it resonates with other implications."
"People must already be aware of that."
"What is more, we will of course need interpretations."
"That is why this Messina-type declaration is quite important."
"Why was there some opposition to this Constitutional Treaty?"
"Because there were concerns that liberal or other tendencies were being over-emphasised."
"I am of a different opinion."
"I believe that the Constitutional Treaty contains solid individual social basic rights."
"It contains twelve concrete basic rights which can be enforced right up to the level of the European Court of Justice."
"Nobody knows about them, however."
"I believe that we must try to bring this element of European life and of the European social model more into the spotlight."
"If we can do that, then we shall be in a better position and less vulnerable to criticism, for, according to Eurobarometer - – if I read the figures correctly - 63% of Europeans are in favour of such a Constitution or Treaty."
"It is not right that a minority put its stamp on the whole of Europe."
"It must be possible to come to a common solution, characterised by consensus, even while some are bound to find fault."
"That is democracy, after all."
"It must be possible for the majority to fight for a majority view, and that is what I am doing."
"I shall say a few words about the subject of sign posts, just to put everyone in the picture."
"Last year in Austria, I was partly responsible for having 20 extra bilingual signposts put up with the cooperation of the Austrian Regional Governor, a measure that was greatly welcomed by all the political parties."
"I now have an ordinance in the course of being appraised which will provide for a further 60."
"We expect the Constitutional Court of Appeal also to recognise the ordinance this week, and we shall produce the final resolution next week."
"However, for me the most important issue is not that of the sign posts. The greatest success for minority politics in Carinthia is that 36% of all school-age children in Carinthia now attend bilingual primary school classes and learn German and Slovenian – voluntarily."
"That is the real success of the European model: the fact that we are voluntarily becoming curious about our languages."
"It makes me very happy to hear praise that we have introduced a bit of realism."
"I have no time for those who mutter that it is all hot air and will evaporate tomorrow."
"We need to prepare in a very professional manner for what we have to do, and the Finns will do just that. I wish them well."
"Matti Vanhanen and his team and Erkki Tuomioja and all the rest will do so just as we have, as will the Germans thereafter."
"However, we still have something to learn, and not only culturally but also in terms of sport, from what is now happening."
"I have just worked out that, so far, we have seen 32 matches in the football world cup, of which 20 have pitted Europe against the rest of the world, that is to say against other continents."
"We have won twelve, drawn four and lost four."
"That is not bad for a global player and, if we do the same in our political dealings, nothing can go wrong anymore."
"."
"Mr President, after the Chancellor’s comprehensive summing-up of the debate, let me just say a few words about enlargement after the European Council."
"The Commission welcomes the conclusions on enlargement of the European Council, skilfully presided by the Austrian Presidency."
"These conclusions pave the way for a new consensus on enlargement in the European Union."
"This new consensus should, above all, enhance our enlightened self-interest to extend the zone of peace, democracy and prosperity in Europe, while, at the same time, ensuring our capacity to function effectively and gradually absorb new members."
"I want to draw your attention to three particular conclusions."
"Firstly, the European Council rightly underlines the success of EU enlargement by stating that it has proved a historic opportunity contributing to peace, security, stability, democracy and the rule of law, as well as to growth and prosperity in the Union as a whole, to which Chancellor Schüssel rightly referred."
"Secondly, I am satisfied that the European Council did not change the criteria of accession that were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993."
"No new criteria were set up; instead, the European Council reaffirmed that it will honour its existing commitments ."
"Thus it confirmed the EU’s consolidated enlargement agenda, which covers south-eastern Europe, i.e. Bulgaria and Romania, Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans."
"I shall have an opportunity to talk about Turkey and its reforms and commitments at this afternoon’s meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Thirdly, the European Council stresses the importance of ensuring that in the future the Union is able to function politically, financially and institutionally as it enlarges, and to further deepen Europe’s common project."
"It is a very important dimension and objective for this House and for the Commission."
"As we know, the European Council will hold a debate in December 2006, and the Commission was invited to report on all the relevant aspects of enlargement pertaining to the Union’s absorption capacity."
"This corresponds by and large to Parliament’s resolution following the Brok report some time ago."
"The Commission will duly and gladly present a strategy document on enlargement, including absorption capacity, as part of our enlargement package in October/November 2006."
"I have started to prepare that document, and we are looking forward to a substantive and responsible enlargement debate with Parliament and the Council."
"This debate should not be limited just to the EU institutions: it should also reach out to civil society, both in the Member States as well as in the candidate countries."
"It is time to create a new consensus on EU enlargement policy, based on the consolidation of our commitments, rigorous application of conditionality and better communication with our citizens."
"That is the best way to ensure that enlargement remains a success story, as has now been acknowledged by the European Council."
"The debate is closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, firstly, please allow me to congratulate the Austrian Presidency and Mr Wolfgang Schüssel, the President, for their work and the results achieved in the past six months."
"In the course of its term, the Austrian Presidency has had to face considerable challenges."
"Further work is required in respect of the Constitutional Treaty before a final – and hopefully positive – decision is reached."
"The ‘parallel approach’ which, on the one hand, continues the reconciliation work regarding the future of the Treaty, and on the other hand, focuses more resolutely on results and projects that facilitate daily processes to a higher extent, seems to be correct."
"I find that the published list containing the successful initiatives that can be implemented by 2010 is very useful in this respect."
"I believe that the adoption of a time schedule regarding continuation has been a particularly significant step forward."
"However, I think it is unfortunate that real, substantial decisions have not been reached even during the Austrian Presidency on issues that are always postponed, such as the regulation of working hours."
"Still, I welcome the initiative that a solemn political statement on European values and endeavours should be made at the March 2007 European Union Summit in Berlin, which will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome."
"I agree that in the case of codecision procedures Council sessions should be public, and I support the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union, in the hope that this will improve the situation of the Hungarian ethnic minority."
"The new Finnish Presidency will inherit numerous unresolved problems, and it will have to focus in the future on economic reforms, social justice, safety and stability, as well as the role of Europe in the world."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Tuesday 20 June 2006."
"Ten years after the Dutroux case, Belgium is once again in the throes of an horrendous drama."
"Two girls, Stacy Lemmens and Nathalie Mahy, have been murdered."
"Their names have been added to those of Julie and Mélissa, to those of An and Eefje and to that of Leyla."
"I would like to express my condolences to their families on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Some people may see this as an individual isolated case that only affects the victims, but when does an isolated case become an issue for society?"
"I believe that we are dealing with an issue for society and that, whether in Belgium or in any other country where such tragedies may take place, we cannot remain indifferent when it is innocence itself that is being murdered."
"It is our duty to consider thoroughly why and how this kind of behaviour continues to take place in our developed and civilised societies."
"That should be another purpose of politics: to prevent it, to help the families of the victims and also to prevent people from forgetting and therefore allowing similar dramatic events from happening again in the future."
"I do not therefore believe that we are yielding to the surge of current public opinion when we stand and remember these victims: because we are not dealing with a single isolated event that warrants no more than a mention in the newspapers; no, we are dealing with a real problem being faced by our society which has a lot to do with the black depths of the human soul."
"While I was preparing this speech, I also heard the news of a tragic rail accident which is likely to have caused 40 deaths and hundreds of injured in Valencia."
"I therefore believe that this is an appropriate time for us all to observe a minute’s silence in memory of all of these victims."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 29 June 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendment has been proposed."
"A request has been received from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, pursuant to Rule 168, to return to committee the report by Mrs Roure on the protection of personal data (police and judicial cooperation), the vote on which was scheduled for tomorrow."
"Do you wish to explain the committee's proposal, Mrs Roure?"
"Mr President, I would like my report on the framework decision on data protection to be referred to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"May I remind you that during the last plenary session we asked the Council for a position and a clear commitment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament."
"We have still not had a response from the Council."
"I know that the Finnish Presidency intends working very closely with us on this subject."
"That is why we need more time and why we are asking for the report to be referred to committee and for tomorrow’s vote to be deferred until the September part-session."
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"– Mr President, with the World Cup being held in Germany, I feel obliged to take this opportunity to congratulate the organisers and the German Government on their safety measures – which are functioning perfectly – and, more importantly, on the hospitality being extended to foreign citizens visiting Germany."
"I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the European Parliament's efforts, both on the resolution on racism in football and on measures to combat forced prostitution during the World Cup, which I denounced in plenary, have paid off."
"Billions of television viewers around the world are watching and hearing our message during transmission of the football results."
"It is without doubt a unique success on the part of the European Parliament."
"I visited Germany during the World Cup and I noted that the German authorities, in cooperation with FIFA, had taken our suggestions on board and that the measures were having positive results."
"Many of them are now experiencing in Germany the enthusiasm and anxiety for their teams and are celebrating their victories together."
"They will return home, where discrimination, racism and xenophobia await them after the intermission for the World Cup."
"Let this happy intermission be an example to us; it showed us that Europe and the entire world can understand differences in a climate of equality, harmony and mutual respect."
"The uprising in the Polish town of Poznan, the first revolt against the dark dictatorship enveloping Central Europe, started fifty years ago, in June 1956."
"As a Hungarian MEP, I believe that it is particularly important to remember the heroes of the democratic movement in Poznan, because the Hungarian revolution in the autumn of 1956 was partly based on and inspired through solidarity with this movement."
"Although the dictatorial Communist regime in Eastern Europe only collapsed a few decades later, in 1989, it is clear that the heroic self-sacrifice of several thousand Poles and Hungarians constituted the first step towards freedom."
"These democratic movements fighting for civil rights showed the world that the Polish and Hungarian nations' love of freedom cannot be suppressed, and that it could not be suppressed even by Soviet tanks and Communist collaborators."
"Here in Europe, in the European Parliament, we are building the Europe of the future, but in order to be successful, we need to know our history well."
"We should not forget that fifty years ago, fundamental values such as democracy, freedom, independence and human rights were already so valuable that thousands of people were ready to sacrifice their lives for them."
"Only in the knowledge of these facts will we be able to appreciate the results that we have achieved together."
"Mr President, the Council, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions have reached agreements with the Spanish Government on the use of Spain’s co-official languages in their activities."
"The Bureau’s rejection of a similar agreement in the European Parliament has led to passionate calls for it to reconsider its decision."
"The President of the and the President of the Galician Parliament have both sent messages calling for a decision in favour."
"The Bureau is going to deal with this issue again at its meeting today."
"As the Community institution directly representing the European citizens, this Parliament cannot close its doors to a form of institutional cooperation that will provide it with means to intensify its relations with the citizens and to give their linguistic rights a European dimension."
"Diversity, a source of mutual openness and wealth, is the genuine meaning of European unity and a genuine counter-balance to the homogenising tendencies of globalisation."
"– Mr President, last week the Turkish press reported that the Turkish Ministry of Home Affairs was conducting an enquiry into the role of the Mayor of Diyarbakir who, according to allegations by the Turkish Government, supported the protesters during the episodes which took place in this town a short while ago."
"At the same time, the Turkish authorities have prevented 41 Kurdish visitors from leaving Istanbul because their Iraqi passports contain both Arabic and Kurdish script."
"How can we negotiate with a country in which there are no fundamental democratic institutions and which also snubs us as an institution, given that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Gul, has refused to appear before next week's Committee on Foreign Affairs?"
"Let us take decisions which will ensure that there are no surprises in store in a few years' time."
"We may not be here, but we need to be careful as to what we leave behind for those who come after us."
"Mr President, the adoption at the most recent plenary session of a resolution which slanders first and foremost Poles and the radio station , making unfounded allegations of homophobia, anti-semitism, xenophobia and racism, is a scandal against which I have received thousands of protests, including those asking whether any of the 301 Members who sanctioned this Machiavellian lie have ever listened to ."
"The resolution has already been cited with the aim of inciting violence against my nation and against the radio station in question, which also has non-Catholic listeners."
"I would therefore like to ask whether this is what tolerance means in the European Union; a European Union in which a minority imposes its views on millions of citizens, and attempts to impose not only a superstate with one government, military and currency, but also a single legitimate ideology, something with which Poles are particularly familiar from their experience of previous totalitarian systems?"
"I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to the young Member from Finland to show some respect for the truth and for women, something which even a less sophisticated culture requires as a minimum."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Krupa."
"I must point out that they have not only written to you."
"The President of Parliament has also received a letter from the President of the Polish Parliament expressing his concern and rejection of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament."
"That letter has been passed on to the members of the Conference of Presidents where it will be subjected to political analysis at its next meeting."
"– Mr President, in all the countries of Europe there is the capital and a large city: there are Madrid and Barcelona, there are Paris and Lyon, there are Rome and Milan."
"In Greece, there is no shortage of cities competing with the capitals in terms of quality of life."
"In Greece, we have our second city, Thessaloniki, the symbol of all the Balkans, a city with a two-and-a-half thousand year history, which bears the name of Alexander the Great's sister, that is how far back it dates, a city which was the cultural capital of Europe ten years ago and which is in a terrible state."
"It has three times the pollution of any city in Europe."
"It does not have even 100 metres of intersections."
"It has no trams, no metro, not even a flyover."
"The people are suffocating: it takes about two hours to travel five kilometres."
"So we need to do something."
"Mrs Hübner had the kindness to tell me the mayor's position is ineffective; in other words, he has not asked for anything."
"However, this does not mean that the people of Thessaloniki need to have the quality of life which they have."
"We need to do something."
"We are currently celebrating the 550th anniversary of a victory of worldwide importance."
"We are celebrating the fact that ten thousand soldiers in a Hungarian border fortress, called Nándorfehérvár in those days and Belgrade today, managed to stop the one hundred thousand-strong Turkish army."
"This was a tremendous victory, because three years after the fall of Constantinople not only the Balkans, but Western Christendom too was in extreme danger when the Sultan started to advance along the Danube."
"The Pope was so relieved and happy that he ordered the bells to be rung at midday in every church, every day."
"This is why church bells have been ringing at midday in Christendom for over five hundred years."
"After the Nándorfehérvár victory, the Turks did not dare threaten the Western world for seventy years, and the ensuing huge social and economic boom allowed capitalism to take hold."
"The victory also demonstrated that Christendom was able to defend its values when it acted in union, because the victory against the numerically superior enemy was shared by West European mercenaries too, some of whom, however, fought on the Turkish side as well."
"A strategic alliance was formed between the Catholic kingdom of Hungary and the Balkan nations, especially the Serbs and Albanians, which later included Wallachia too."
"Unfortunately, volunteer crusaders arrived only from Hungary and our East European region, although solidarity should have been reciprocal then, just like it should be today."
"– Mr President, I should like to denounce before the European Parliament today's unacceptable decision by FIFA to suspend the Hellenic Football Federation and to ban the staging of international matches in Greece, the country which organised such spectacular Olympic Games and in which the sporting ideal was born."
"In its response to a question about the legal framework of professional football, the competent Commissioner, Mr Figel, told me that the national authorities are basically responsible for clarifying the legal framework relating to the staging of sports at Member State level."
"The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has to ensure that Community law is fully respected and applied."
"FIFA has passed a decision that undermines this vertical relationship between the European Union and the Member States and is unacceptable."
"The Commissioner said, and I quote, that FIFA and UEFA, insofar as they are engaged in economic activities, must ensure that they comply with the legislation of the European Community."
"We have case law."
"– ( Mr President, the trial of the Palestinian doctor and Bulgarian nurses in Libya reopened three weeks ago."
"The procedure chosen is a very complicated one and will make it very difficult for international organisations to help defend the rights of these persons who have been wrongly imprisoned."
"In fact, the procedure involves only one hearing a week."
"You can see how difficult it is going to be to organise their defence."
"Moreover, everyone knows that, materially speaking, the crimes of which they are accused are implausible and that these citizens have been held in prison and tortured for seven years."
"May we therefore join together in saying to Libya that our only concern, now and in the future, is to help young Libyans who are infected with Aids. In no case, however, do we want Libya to take citizens hostage, be they from Europe or anywhere else in the world."
"We must say to the authorities, in the name of human rights, in the name of respect for Libya, ‘release them!’"
"The Memorandum of Understanding concerning the implementation of the Nabucco gas pipeline project was signed in Vienna over the past week."
"This is obviously good news, at a time when we continue to receive mainly negative news from the natural gas market."
"Following the supply problems experienced at the beginning of the year, further problems are predicted for winter, and prices are rising; also, in a manner not unrelated to this, Russia is using its position as a gas supplier as one of its political instruments, in an increasingly obvious fashion."
"Therefore, the vulnerability of Europe and European consumers is continuously increasing."
"In this situation, the twenty to thirty billion cubic metre capacity of the Nabucco pipeline would tangibly increase gas supply security in the European Union within a decade."
"This would be due to the fact that Nabucco provides a simultaneous diversification both in respect of the transit route and the source of procurement, compared with other proposals that would only provide an alternative transport route for the existing infrastructure."
"Therefore, we should welcome the Memorandum of Understanding signed last week, and we can state that at this time, Nabucco does not have any real competitors in terms of increasing the European Union's natural gas supply resources."
"Mr President, there is something to which I should like to draw your attention."
"On 10 July 2003, Sibel Yalvac, a 21-year old, mentally-retarded woman from Rotterdam was arrested at the airport of the Indonesian capital of Djakarta."
"On 6 April 2004, she was sentenced there to 10 years’ imprisonment for smuggling drugs."
"Two independent Dutch experts, a psychologist and a probation officer, have examined Sibel and declared her to be not fully ."
"She has difficulty distinguishing between cause and effect, is gullible, has a great deal of fantasy and cannot count to 12."
"Sibel has been exploited by ruthless criminals for their drugs trade and now faces years of hell."
"It so happens that in Indonesia, each year around Independence Day, which falls on 17 August, there is a possibility of gaining amnesty."
"Together with my fellow countryman, Mr van Bommel, who is a member of the Dutch Lower House, I have started a campaign to ask the Indonesian Government to be lenient and, given her special circumstances, to grant Sibel amnesty."
"On behalf of Sibel and her desperate family, the ‘Help Sibel’ campaign is asking for your support in this matter."
"Mr President, a few days ago, on 29 June, the 120th anniversary of the birth of Robert Schuman took place, one of the founding fathers of a united Europe."
"It is a shame that this anniversary went by so unnoticed; it is a shame because I do not know how this honourable statesman would feel if he were here today and could see how the European Parliament is breaking yet another barrier protecting the human species from destructive biomedical experiments."
"We have to call a spade a spade."
"The funding of research into human embryos and embryonic stem cells under the Seventh Framework Programme, a Programme which is necessary in other respects, creates a dangerous testing ground with respect to ."
"Human embryos are not objects; they are the beginnings of a human being just like you, like me and like all of us."
"How does this fit in with respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, for instance, which states in Article 1 that ‘Human dignity is inviolable."
"It must be respected and protected’?"
"How does this fit in with respect for the legislation which is binding in many Member States of the European Union, including Poland?"
"How does this fit in with respect for the religious beliefs of many Europeans?"
"That is why I appeal for reflection and for halting this decision."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out a worrying development to you and to my fellow MEPs: the deterioration that I feel is taking place in relations between the European institutions and that section of civil society that is represented by consumer associations."
"The latest event that I should like specifically to point out (though there have been others) is what happened recently at the European Food Safety Authority."
"In accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the 14 members comprising the management board must include four members that should have – and I quote from the text – ‘their background in organisations representing consumers and other interests in the food chain’."
"It says 'and' and not 'or' in the article but, in actual fact, only members representing interests were appointed."
"Mr President, I too should like to pay tribute to the Polish citizens who, 50 years ago, stood up in Poznań for their freedom, dignity and social justice against a Communist dictatorship introduced by the Soviet Union."
"This autumn will also mark 50 years of the Hungarian revolution."
"These anniversaries remind us of a task still to be accomplished: the integration of our historic heritage to unite people’s perception of history in all parts of Europe."
"Mr President, I expected you to mention the Poznań uprising in your introduction today."
"Tomorrow I will be interested to learn more about the Franco dictatorship in your native country."
"Still, I expect you to show an equal interest in the history of central and eastern Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month, we held a debate here in response to the tragic deaths in Antwerp of a two-year old girl and her Malian nanny who died at the hands of an 18-year old lunatic."
"Ten days ago, my city of Antwerp was once again startled by brutal and racist violence when in broad daylight and right in the city centre, six young immigrants stamped a 53-year old train driver to death on a public transport bus, because he dared to ask them to keep the noise down."
"This reminds me of those two French men, Jean-Claude Irvoas and Jean-Jacques Le Chenadec, who were lynched during last year’s riots in the French for similar reasons."
"These too are incidents of racism, of anti-white, anti-Flemish and anti-French racism."
"I therefore dare express the hope here that this House, concerned as it is about every form of xenophobia and intolerance, will once again organise a debate on a matter of topical and urgent importance, that matter being the explosive situation involving migrants in the districts of some major European cities."
"At least then, the most courageous gesture of my murdered fellow-countryman will not have been in vain."
"Mr President, 18 months ago I was one of the signatories of the appeal, signed by over 50 Members, which called for Parliament to support the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey."
"I also voted in our Parliament for the door to be opened to Ankara."
"It is therefore all the more regrettable that today there are reports in the world press of another attempt on the life of a Catholic priest in Turkey."
"The priest is injured but has survived the attack."
"Sadly, this is not the first attack on a clergyman, a non-Muslim, in that country."
"The previous attack had a tragic end as the priest was killed."
"Personally, I am worried about Turkey’s failure to respect religious freedom."
"I am not the only one who is worried."
"This makes the road to European Union membership longer for Turkey."
"Even supporters such as myself, who are in favour of enlarging the European Union structures to include this country, believe this to be the case."
"– Mr President, I should like to express my deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and my support for the Palestinian people."
"Events following the abduction of the Israeli soldier and Israel's reprisals are, on the one hand, harming the Palestinians as a political entity, with their representatives, be they ministers or parliamentarians, being abducted and with citizens' being deprived of passports and residency rights, and are impoverishing the entire nation, given that bridges, schools and pumping and electricity stations are being bombed and set on fire, on the other."
"Apart from direct humanitarian aid and the call for both sides to act in a mature and responsible manner, we must also set other objectives and analyse the situation, the causes, the aims of each side and the means being used to achieve them and we must also analyse our own political conduct."
"European citizens are calling on us to defend the principles of legality, international law and solidarity."
"They are also calling for us to defend the European national and Community resources used to finance the infrastructure works of the Palestinian Authority which are then destroyed in Israeli attacks."
"Mr President, this afternoon the decision will be made as to whether, finally, the citizens of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia will be able to address the European Parliament in their respective mother tongues."
"I hope that the letters from the Presidents of the Parliaments of Catalonia and Galicia which have been addressed to the Presidency will help to win the respect and support of those people who have opposed what will be a great step forward in terms of bringing more than 11 million speakers of those languages closer to the European Union."
"It is just one step, a first step, on the basis of which we will have to move forward towards full recognition of the rights of these citizens, who have made their resolutely European tradition and vocation one of the pillars of their democratic societies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to make it clear that, when we advocate the use of these co-official languages of the Spanish State by its citizens in their relations with the Union, we are also defending the linguistic rights of all those speakers of languages of the current EU Member States – rights that have not yet been fully recognised in the normal functioning of this Parliament; these citizens have our full support."
"Thank you, Mrs Badia."
"Thank you for alerting me to the existence of the letters from the Presidents of the Parliaments of Catalonia and Galicia, which are not scheduled to be put to the Bureau today."
"Parliament’s services will ascertain whether those letters have arrived or whether they are still on their way to us."
"– I wish to greet the workers from Opel General Motors in the Azambuja region of Portugal in this plenary session, who are currently fighting for their jobs and for the future of the company, following the threat of manufacturing being transferred abroad. If this threat materialises, thousands of jobs will be lost and the social and economic impact will be devastating."
"Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions putting forward a series of recommendations on company relocations."
"I therefore feel it is vitally important for Parliament to examine what initiatives the Commission has taken with a view to implementing the following measures: making Community aid conditional on long-term agreements on employment and local development, as Parliament has proposed; setting up a register of companies relocating and benefiting directly or indirectly from public incentives, thereby failing to meet their contractual obligations; refusal to grant or requirement to return Community funding for companies that fail to meet their contractual obligations in full – I wonder how many times this has been implemented; practical measures adopted by the Commission to support the workers and to foster the economic recovery of the regions affected by relocations; and the drafting of a Code of Conduct to prevent company relocations."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to another case of discrimination that has arisen recently."
"My colleague hired a car from Europcar in Brussels to drive to Strasbourg."
"The hire company’s representative explained to him that the car could not be used in the countries of the East and indicated the forbidden areas."
"I found that very strange because Europcar operates in all the new member countries."
"How is that possible?"
"I have myself hired cars for two years in Budapest and I was able to drive from Budapest to Brussels. I did not, however, travel from Brussels to Budapest with a car from the same company."
"The explanation given was that it was a very dangerous area."
"Now, statistics show that fewer cars are stolen in Slovenia and Hungary than in some countries of the Fifteen."
"That is no doubt a detail, but it reminds you of the case of the Polish plumber."
"We shall find out what has happened so that we can prevent any kind of discrimination and because we cannot carry on adding cases."
"After the Polish plumber, we cannot now get into the case of the Belgian car."
"I am sure that Mr McCreevy will have taken good note."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak about a serious incident that took place only a few hours ago: 18 emigrants have drowned while heading for the Canary Islands, and another two emigrants were found dead this morning at the Melilla fence, between Morocco and Spain."
"According to a statement made by a representative of the Melilla Government, the two people would appear to have been shot dead."
"We, in this House, have already previously denounced the Spanish civil guard's use of firearms on immigrants."
"The Spanish daily claims that handguns have been used in an intimidatory fashion to deter immigrants who wanted to cross the Melilla border."
"Mr President, we believe that all of this is very serious and we would ask you whether it is possible for the Bureau to ascertain the truth of these claims, with a view to determining whether it is true that the Spanish civil guard has used firearms to prevent immigrants from being able to climb over the Melilla fence."
"We feel that all of this is very serious and we believe that the European Parliament should urgently intervene on this matter, with a view to preventing further deaths at the border between Morocco and Spain."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a problem which arose a few weeks ago, and which is a recurrence of a problem which also arose last year."
"The matter concerns raids on Polish construction companies in Germany and their destruction."
"Many companies are scared to talk about this, and some have told of incidents which occur during the inspections carried out by finance officers or customs officers, and which remind me of scenes from the Second World War."
"I will give you just one example."
"The company , which has operated on the German market for 16 years, was checked during the past weeks by 250 officials."
"The German newspaper printed on its front page a photo of a Polish worker standing in front of a wall with his hands up against the wall, being inspected by customs and finance officers."
"This company has been in operation for 16 years."
"The company’s computers were confiscated, as was the sum of EUR 1.2 million."
"How are these companies supposed to operate in the European Union?"
"The Irish peace process is at a critical juncture."
"The Irish and British Governments have set 24 November 2006 as the date for agreement to be reached among the political parties."
"However, Ian Paisley’s Democratic Unionist Party has shown no interest in power-sharing or in progress and it has been allowed by the two governments to prevent progress being made."
"The Irish and British Governments must act to bring about the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which is an international treaty."
"I urge the Finnish Presidency to encourage everyone concerned to make progress and would ask Parliament and the President to join in this call."
"Without such progress, the peace process is in danger of unravelling further."
"Mr President, in his written declaration, the Communist Daniel Strož accuses Estonians of mass execution of Jewish people during the Second World War."
"It is a harsh lie which is not based on fact."
"On the contrary, Jewish people have lived side by side with Estonians as one family for centuries."
"Already in 1925, Estonia adopted an act of cultural autonomy for ethnic minorities."
"It was an extraordinary event in the whole world at that time, and Jewish people entered our state in their golden book."
"During the Second World War, Estonians helped and rescued Jews, and in memory of that, a tree of gratitude has been planted in Yad Vashem Park in Jerusalem."
"Estonia was the only occupied country where provoking programmes did not succeed."
"I do not know what made Daniel Strož publish it."
"Was it foolishness or something else?"
"It does not matter."
"Mr President, the car manufacturing plant in Warsaw which, until 2000, was owned by the Korean company Daewoo managed to avoid bankruptcy, paid off 92% of its debts and cut two thirds of jobs thanks to the determination of its management and staff."
"The plant asked the Polish Government for a loan in line with the restructuring plan."
"A recommendation from the EU Commissioner for Competition is needed in order to receive this loan."
"The plant has valuable long-term contracts, which means that there should have been no difficulty in obtaining approval for the loan."
"However, after a meeting with the Polish economy minister in Brussels, there are reports in the media that the Commissioner for Competition is considering refusing to recommend the loan."
"This will damage the factory and amount to an attempt to drive it into bankruptcy, and, most importantly, will be harmful to fair competition in the European Union."
"Such a refusal by officials in Brussels will mean that they are acting not for the common good but in the interest of a select number of capital groups and car corporations."
"That is something we cannot support."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the interim report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry into the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, on the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society [2006/2026(INI) (A6-0221/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present our interim report and I would like to thank our secretariat, the Chairman of our committee and the members for their support and work."
"The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens: the loss of their pension investments."
"The challenge now for us as the European Parliament is to exercise our supervisory powers over EU legislation."
"We have perhaps a once-in-a-generation chance to look in detail at the implementation process of EU law, taking one particular directive as an example."
"Did we the institutions get it right?"
"Did the Member States get it right?"
"How can we do better in the future?"
"This fits well with our wider, better legislation agenda."
"In presenting the interim report, first let me deal with two items regarding the process: one general and one particular."
"This is the first such committee of inquiry in ten years."
"Each time we have the chance to learn how to do this better in future, to build our own institutional knowledge."
"We have, as always, been asked to produce an interim report but, to report properly we need all the evidence, all the studies, all the answers to our inquiries to be available."
"Having to produce an interim report as a matter of form is something of a distraction, although of course we like to keep our colleagues informed as to where we are."
"Maybe we can think about this question for the future."
"This brings me to the particular aspect."
"Our inquiry is about the EU aspects of this case."
"Others have already made extensive inquiries in the UK and another, even more in-depth inquiry is due from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman in November 2006."
"It would be foolish for us to publish our report in advance of the information that report is likely to contain."
"The UK Ombudsman has had substantial access to many UK actors in this drama."
"It makes no sense for us to repeat the exercise, but equally it would make no sense for us not to take account of these findings."
"Hence we will need a little more time."
"This is foreseen in the report and we will ask the House to endorse our request for probably a couple more months to produce our final report."
"Let me come to the ground that we have covered."
"This is set out mainly in the annex to the report."
"We have set up our working method, which involves a number of comparative studies; these have been commissioned."
"We have already heard a wealth of evidence, most importantly from many of the victims."
"Their stories have been heartrending."
"They have made me angry – angry that they have been let down by their experience of our internal market for financial services."
"For them it has not produced extra choice, but rather the loss of life savings with no redress mechanisms available."
"We have learnt more details about the Commission’s implementation checks – or rather I should say checklist."
"Maybe we need to look for more checks in the future."
"We have seen the difficulty of inserting EU legislation into the existing fabric of Member States’ legal and regulatory systems."
"It does not always fit."
"We have seen that we can raise undue expectations by what is written in EU law particularly, in this instance, about the availability of compensatory mechanisms."
"When it gets to Member-State level, maybe something gets lost in translation."
"Then there is the big missing part of the jigsaw: access to justice."
"Where is this in a country-of-origin regime?"
"Let this be the real lesson to all of us."
"In this inquiry we have heard from victims sent from pillar to post."
"The Commission has now admitted, in a note to us on home and host country authorities, that this does not work."
"Let me read: ‘The directive can only work smoothly if there is good cooperation between home and host state authorities."
"It is not a satisfactory situation, where aggrieved policyholders are referred by the host state authority to the home state authority and are then sent back by the home to the host authority, thus to find themselves unable to have their case examined by either."
"The Commission plans to seek further discussions with Member States.’"
"I should jolly well hope so!"
"If this inquiry does nothing else, I hope that we can put this injustice right."
"That is an indication of where we have got to as of now; there will be much more to come."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work already carried out by the Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life affair under the leadership of Ms McGuinness and the rapporteur, Ms Wallis."
"The interim report under discussion today provides a useful summary of the committee’s mandate and programme of work."
"As the report says, it is too early to draw conclusions."
"The committee continues to collect evidence."
"We all await with interest the second report of the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman."
"The Commission has, from the start, declared its readiness to cooperate fully with the Committee of Inquiry."
"We have provided all the documentation and information requested by the committee and will continue to provide whatever support we can."
"I will be more than happy to appear before the committee in November."
"The Equitable Life affair has caused much anguish and financial loss for many citizens and we must draw appropriate lessons for the future."
"In that context, our ongoing Solvency II insurance project is aimed at contributing to the financial strength of all EU insurance undertakings."
"Solvency II intends to enhance policyholder protection and to overhaul and deepen EU regulation and supervision in the insurance area."
"Risk-oriented calculations of the solvency requirements of insurance undertakings would be introduced."
"Under Solvency II, the calculation of insurance liabilities will be harmonised and convergence of supervisory practices will be fostered."
"I am confident that those efforts will create a framework that helps to prevent this kind of financial crisis happening again."
"."
"Mr President, I am something of a thorn between two roses: Ms Wallis, who spoke so well today as the rapporteur, and the able and charming Ms McGuinness, the chairman of our committee."
"That means that I often find myself caught between the two of them, but the work they have done is excellent and what Ms Wallis has spoken about today proves that point."
"We have had several meetings at which many organisations and individuals have presented evidence that confirms me in my judgement that this special committee was very necessary."
"We have been much impressed, angered and even moved by those speaking to us and the financial and emotional losses they are experiencing."
"We have also heard from some of those who are responsible for regulation."
"So far, I do not think there is any evidence of negligence or criminal activity, but I would characterise their behaviour so far as benign complacency."
"There are as yet no firm conclusions, but one loophole has been exposed."
"If a German or an Irishman buys a policy from a British company, it is the British regulator who is responsible for the financial probity of that company."
"The German or Irish regulators appear to play no role, but that does not help the EU citizen, for whom it is impractical, inconvenient and costly to pursue concerns with the British regulator, even supposing he were interested."
"The Commission needs to address this."
"We continue our investigation, but we have no magic wand to restore the fortunes of the aggrieved policyholders."
"As Ms Wallis said, we must close the loopholes, learn from what has gone before and improve the position next time, especially as it relates to the activities of the Commission."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome the debate tonight on this interim report by Mrs Wallis, which has largely been agreed by consensus within the Committee of Inquiry."
"One of the extraordinary aspects of this issue is the fact that those outside the UK who purchased policies from Equitable Life did so believing that they had European Union protection and that the regulators in their own country would protect them."
"They then discovered some years ago that, in fact, they have no protection whatsoever."
"When the 8300 investors in Ireland, who were putting money aside for their pensions, and about 4000 such investors in Germany went to their respective regulators, they were told to go and talk to the UK regulator."
"This is not the way that people expected to be dealt with."
"This report highlights another important aspect: the manner in which this has come to the House through the Committee on Petitions."
"That committee is one of the most effective ways of bringing Europe close to the citizens."
"The Commissioner and others have said that it is too early yet to draw conclusions."
"However, one of the conclusions I have come to is that we need to look closely at the manner in which financial services are regulated, because it would appear that we expect a regulator to do two functions which are distinctly different."
"One is to protect the stability of the financial services market, and the other is to protect the interests of the investor."
"At one level it may be that this is possible, because clearly an investor in pension funds is interested in having a stable market."
"However, when it comes to the crunch – when a treasury may face large claims – does the regulator protect the market or protect the investor?"
"In this particular instance the UK Treasury was directly responsible for regulating Equitable Life and it would have been faced with claims for billions of pounds sterling had it found that Equitable Life should close down."
"It did not choose to do so."
"I would argue that we need to look closely in Solvency II at what regulators are expected to do and separate out those two functions."
"."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Ms Wallis for her report."
"I agree that it is too early to draw conclusions; however, I would like to make a few observations."
"The first is about solvency."
"Whether or not the company should be considered to have been solvent during the time leading up to the crisis has several consequences."
"That affects the policyholders’ possibilities of defending their rights and interests, but it also has an impact upon the responsibility of the UK authorities and, possibly, the Commission."
"The UK authorities strongly emphasised that Equitable Life had never had any problems with solvency and always complied with EU law."
"The UK authorities also indicated that there are a number of different ways of valuing assurance companies."
"If there are several ways of calculating solvency, how is it possible to make a proper analysis?"
"It is clear that the directive seeks to ensure that an assurance company is not managed in such a manner that it may jeopardise the undertaking’s solvency in the long term."
"It is also clear that the directive obliges Member States to take such measures with regard to the undertaking, its directors or managers, or the persons who control as are appropriate and necessary in order to prevent or remedy any irregularities prejudicial to the interests of the assured persons."
"I doubt whether this has happened."
"The fact that the UK authorities always considered Equitable Life solvent also had repercussions on customers and authorities in other Member States."
"It appears that both customers and authorities in Ireland and Germany were taken by surprise when the crisis broke out."
"Another observation I have, which concerns the country of origin principle, is the question of monitoring and provision of information."
"The UK authorities, who were responsible for monitoring the activities of the company in other Member States too, never informed those Member States that there was a problem."
"Maybe it was because they did not want to recognise this."
"Frankly, in hindsight, it does not look as if the supervision has worked."
"The second problem with the home country of origin rule is the lack of redress for consumers, who have been sent back and forth by the national authorities."
"Consumers who trusted that the European Union would guarantee them an equivalent position and safeguards if they bought assurance on the internal market as they would if they had bought on the national market found themselves in a situation where nobody would accept responsibility for their efforts to obtain damages for their losses."
"From a consumer point of view, the home country of origin principle turned out to be a real ping-pong game."
"There seems to be a large vacuum in EU legislation here."
"The EU should take more measures to protect individual citizens."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Wallis, who is a very experienced lawyer and an excellent rapporteur."
"We have heard a whole series of reports prepared by Mrs Wallis which have been characterised by outstandingly precise legal language and a brilliantly clear description of the facts."
"Mrs Wallis is also a member of the Committee on Petitions."
"I have the honour and pleasure of working with her on that committee and I always regard her work with great respect."
"This also applies to the report we are discussing today."
"The case of Equitable Life was first sent to the Committee on Petitions."
"The committee is very pleased that the case is being discussed at a plenary session of the European Parliament."
"Insurance matters are incredibly sensitive issues."
"We all remember well the Lloyds case which we recently looked into."
"These are cases which are damaging to large numbers of people, in this case the many thousands of people who trusted the insurance company Equitable Life with their future."
"Just when they reach old age it turns out that they have been left without means and a great injustice has been committed against them."
"We must look into the matter very carefully but there is also another matter related to this case and that is the effectiveness of our actions."
"Mrs Wallis very aptly said that it is not simply a matter of implementing or adopting the directive but a matter of both implementing the directive and involving everyone who is affected by the directive."
"Therein lies the problem which we often face, namely that decisions of the European Parliament as well as those of other European bodies are sometimes not as effective as they should be."
"It should be important to us, when Parliament adopts a certain position, for that position on the matter (at the moment I am thinking of the insurance cases, and the Equitable Life case in particular) to be enforced in its entirety, so that it does not merely end with a Parliament decision or a Parliament resolution."
"It must end with the making good of the damage done to a very large number of people, and the effectiveness of our work is incredibly important here."
"Mrs Wallis proposed in her report that our House should address this matter and adopt a position which would facilitate the work of the committee in the future."
"I strongly appeal for all the suggestions put forward by Mrs Wallis in her report on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry to be supported by the House."
"I congratulate Mrs Wallis and I hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be found to this matter as well as for those people who have suffered damages as a result of the Equitable Life case."
"Mr President, this is a rare occasion for me: I have more than one minute’s speaking time and for once I am not going to disagree with anyone!"
"I should like to emphasise one or two things that have been said and look at them from a slightly different perspective."
"There are a number of practical issues that Ms Wallis touched on, as indeed did Sir Robert Atkins."
"The reality is that we have had many potential witnesses on our list; we have heard a few; and there are a great many more that we need to hear if we can."
"That includes many of the most important witnesses."
"Another practical problem is that too many of these witnesses have come forward at the same meeting, so there has been very little time to interrogate them."
"There has been no real cross-examination; they are not under oath; we have not been able to subpoena them; and there is the practical problem that flows from the inevitable requirement of interpretation."
"Taken together those are fairly serious weaknesses, although the committee is collectively doing its very best to overcome them."
"To give you an illustration of what I am talking about, the British Government turned up en masse."
"A spokesman for the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary all arrived together, clearly having rehearsed their parts to the nth degree."
"They hunted as a pack, they stood together and we were unable to prise them apart or to check facts because they had come to admit nothing and to concede nothing."
"Even their answers to specific questions were evasive."
"To give you one vivid illustration, they denied that the Government or the equivalent department had any knowledge of problems with Equitable Life ten years before we knew – and we have proof that they did."
"With regard to the point about shared management, which has been raised by others, it seems to me that, in this case, shared management is turning out to be no management at all."
"The Irish thought that the British Government was checking on Equitable Life."
"If they were, they were saying nothing."
"So, the Irish were kept in ignorance."
"If today, for example, a Latvian financial services company started conducting business all over the European Union, it seems each Member State would assume that the Latvian Government was itself satisfied, but that would not necessarily be the case."
"This is not a reflection on Latvia, just an example."
"However, if that company was outside the European Union, every Member State would check thoroughly."
"That is a problem."
"Mr President, as the person chairing the Committee of Inquiry, I can reassure Mr Mote that those witnesses who did not answer be back – we have a guarantee!"
"I would urge the members of the committee to sharpen their interrogating skills and we will get answers, because that is a priority."
"I would say to my eloquent friend, Sir Robert Atkins, that, whilst he described me and the rapporteur as roses, we intend rather to be thorns in the side of the system, because there is something rotten here."
"People have been badly burnt and the system has failed them."
"We have heard from all the petitioners of the disasters suffered by individuals."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction, but an important one just the same, because it will awaken Members of this House to the importance of detail."
"We vote here, we go home and we forget that in a couple of years the votes we take here are implemented in Member States."
"Sometimes we get it wrong as legislators and I think Equitable Life might yet prove that."
"We have not reached any conclusions yet, but one thing we have established is that the regulators were playing games of ping-pong with policyholders."
"It is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country."
"In my view, there is a key question to be answered."
"Some say they know the answer, but I have not come to any conclusion."
"Who knew of the difficulties in Equitable Life and when?"
"Were others notified?"
"In other words, were Member States’ regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible?"
"Is it not the case that the directives, as they are implemented, would not allow a regulator to reveal confidential information that might dissuade a policyholder from investing in companies with problems like Equitable?"
"That is a key question."
"Beyond the work we are doing today, there is no doubt that Equitable has left a sour taste for the losers and others who are watching events unfolding and it does nothing to help those who are trying to encourage citizens to invest in pensions."
"What we find out from our investigation will be key for the future."
"Everyone tells us that with Solvency II life will be great in the future, but it will not be unless we get the regulations right."
"In conclusion, you can have all the regulation in the world, but if there is not a committed individual watching and guiding for all the Member States, it will amount to nothing."
"Finally, who is regulating the regulators?"
"Is it the Commission?"
"Mr President, first of all, let me say that I welcome the report by Mrs Wallis."
"Investigations into the Equitable Life Assurance Society are becoming more and more painstaking, and the deeper we delve, the more we are compelled to recognise what a tangled web of events we are actually examining and how much has actually gone wrong at all sorts of levels."
"With our resolution today we will reaffirm that governments, parliaments and the responsible authorities in the Member States, and particularly in the United Kingdom, must do more to assist the committee of inquiry in the fulfilment of its mandate, for the principle of cooperation in good faith which is enshrined in the Treaties must be upheld."
"The committee of inquiry has explicit powers to request documents and to summon and question witnesses, but it is also entitled to have its questions answered."
"The answers given by people in positions of responsibility at the committee’s hearings, however, have been far from satisfactory."
"To be precise, this applies to the answers given by both the British Financial Services Authority and the Commission."
"The fact is that, in the case of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, no one either feels responsible or wants to accept responsibility, and the policyholders are left hanging."
"Imagine policyholders in Cologne or in Galway trying in vain to obtain information. From one month to the next they are being strung along."
"If it comes to the point that even a committee of inquiry is being fobbed off with politically correct and legally safe answers, how much worse must it be for the woman in Cologne or the man in Galway who, as a policyholder, is personally affected, whose money is at risk, who is perhaps approaching retirement age and now has to scramble after his or her pension."
"There are two things we can and must do: firstly, we must make the best possible use of the mandate given to us in the committee of inquiry to establish clarity, so that policyholders are finally shown where the faults and weaknesses lie."
"Secondly, all of us, and especially the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must endeavour to ensure that the Solvency II project provides greater security in future for all concerned, so that we no longer need a committee of inquiry to discover whether the fault lies in European legislation, in the way it has been transposed by a Member State or in a company’s mismanagement."
"Mr President, the report we are discussing here today is very much an interim report into the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society in Britain."
"Due to the very technical nature of the European Parliament’s investigations into this issue, this Committee of Inquiry is going to take a lot more time to complete its work."
"This is a very serious business for the European Parliament."
"We should recall that, from an Irish perspective alone, over 6500 Irish citizens lost their pension investments either in total or in part as a result of the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society."
"In this day and age, when there is so much EU regulation concerning the governance of financial investments, this is simply an intolerable and unacceptable situation."
"It is not, as Mr Mote said, that the Irish were kept in ignorance: they were treated differently."
"I say that it is intolerable and unacceptable for any company, financial or otherwise, to treat its policyholders differently."
"They should be treated the same, whether they are British, Irish or German."
"The committee has already invited a number of key witnesses to the European Parliament, including from the following categories: pensioners’ groups, the Equitable Life Members’ Action Group;"
"The committee is going to have to invite more witnesses if it is to get down to the nuts and bolts of how the UK life assurance market has operated in recent years."
"The committee is also going to need more time to carry out a comprehensive, comparative analysis into the operation of similar life assurance markets in Germany and in Ireland."
"The European Parliament is carrying out a very serious inquiry and the Committee of Inquiry is going to need more time to complete its work."
"I urge Members of this House to give it that time and to give it every means at the disposal of this Parliament to complete its work."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for an excellent interim report, as also the Chairman, Mrs McGuinness, who will, I am sure, be a thorn in the side of the regulators and ensure that we can get to the bottom of what actually happened with Equitable Life."
"Equitable Life is the world’s oldest assurance company; right up to the end of 1999, even Westminster MPs’ pension funds were still being invested in the company."
"Thousands of investors have lost money because of the cost of over-bonusing ‘with-profit’ life assurance policies."
"Many assurance companies offer with-profit policies – I have several such policies myself – but provided the company does not pay out more bonuses than it can afford the system works perfectly well."
"In my opinion, from the mid 1990s until 2000 the Equitable Life Assurance Society over-bonused its with-profit policies, which showed on paper at least that Equitable Life had the best results of all major assurance companies, thus encouraging people to take Equitable Life policies out."
"The problem is that the cost in real terms of overvaluing the policies meant that Equitable Life paid out nearly GBP 6 billion more than it earned between 1997 and 2000."
"No assurance company, however large, can afford such sums."
"From the information and evidence collected for the committee, it all seems very convenient that so many people carrying out the checks and balances of the company came very late to the party: i.e., the present board of management took over in 2000 after the company had all but ceased taking on new business; the Financial Services Authority was not created until late 1999, so it is not responsible for what happened before it came into existence; the financial actuaries advising the UK Government before the FSA was formed maintain that Equitable Life was always solvent, although one actuary giving evidence to our inquiry did admit there are up to six ways of valuing an insurance company."
"The committee has heard from many people who invested in Equitable Life and who have lost a great deal of money, which has caused them great hardship."
"The committee will carry on its work and we are determined to find out what went wrong with Equitable Life so that these problems do not happen in the future."
"We will try to get the best deal for those who have Equitable Life policies."
"Mr President, Mrs Wallis’s report is an interim report, since the Committee of Inquiry still has a lot of work to do."
"In any event, a parliamentary committee of inquiry is not a court of justice. In other words, this committee is not going to be able to decide whether the British authorities have behaved correctly or incorrectly in their regulation of this field; that is a job for the courts of justice."
"What are being exposed at the moment are shortcomings in the European Union’s rules, since they are intended to make it possible for activities of this kind to be carried out across national borders."
"What we are detecting at the moment is that there is no control mechanism for activities crossing national borders."
"As the representative of the Commission has said, each national authority is theoretically responsible for supervision, but, when the company collapsed, neither the Irish authorities nor the German authorities were able to do anything, because the company’s subsidiaries and branches in their respective countries were closed at that point."
"The 6 500 pensioners that Mr Ó Neachtain was talking about, in Ireland, and the thousands of pensioners in Germany, did not therefore have any opportunity to exercise control."
"As I said before, a parliamentary committee is not a court of justice, but it can draw conclusions from a legislative point of view."
"I believe that the lesson we can now draw in this sense is that, at the moment, the principle of mutual recognition, the so-called ‘Community passport’, is not enough."
"When laying down Community rules, an effective control mechanism must also be established, which, eliminating the principle of country of origin or country of provenance, makes it possible for the European Union institutions to monitor the operations of institutions operating across national borders."
"I believe that that is the most important conclusion we can draw so far."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Wallis on her work on this interim report and on the clarity of her proposals;"
"I would also like to say how much I agree with her proposed approach."
"I also agree with her on the points that must be examined in the weeks and months ahead."
"The exercise the Committee of Inquiry is engaged in is not an easy one."
"It needs first of all to look for the causes of the situation in which Equitable Life policyholders find themselves."
"In this regard, everything that the motion for a European Parliament resolution asks for and requires must be approved."
"Much is at stake, and the limits of the exercise need to be all the clearer because of that."
"As the previous speaker said, we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a parliamentary Committee of Inquiry."
"It is not a court of law able to hand down decisions on penalties or compensation."
"The information collected will, at the most, be useful for defending the victims’ interests, furnishing them with evidence that may be used in any proceedings they may take."
"On the other hand, the results of the investigations may make a crucial contribution to the development of European regulation."
"They may reveal the inadequacies of the rules laid down or the failings in how they are applied."
"There will, no doubt, be more general lessons to be drawn by Parliament itself, by the Member States and by the Commission when it comes to regulating and monitoring the decisions that are taken."
"The work that has begun must therefore be continued accurately, determinedly and dispassionately, and with no ambiguity as to the expected outcome, lest undue expectations again be raised for the victims."
"Mr President, most of what needs to be said has been said already."
"I commend Mrs Wallis’s report."
"It is a very thorough interim report."
"I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months."
"It is vital that we do not rush to judgment and that we await the outcome of the inquiries that are being undertaken in the United Kingdom."
"Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred, and particularly at the application of Community law."
"In that respect I am pleased to be speaking before Commissioner McCreevy."
"I look forward to what he has to say."
"It is vital, as I have said, that we do not rush to make a judgement."
"The witnesses have been extremely forthcoming and cooperative with the Committee of Inquiry."
"Uppermost in our minds, as the former speaker said, is that we have some recourse to justice, but we must certainly ensure that another Equitable Life crisis never happens again."
"Those people did what, arguably, we ask all good citizens to do: provide for their retirement, their future."
"They did so in what should be arguably one of the safest investment pots in any investment industry."
"It failed to be so, on the evidence that we have before us."
"I commend the report and the work of the temporary committee."
"."
"Mr President, as has been pointed out, drawing conclusions at this stage would be premature."
"The Commission looks forward to continuing working with the Committee of Inquiry."
"The aim is to see how we can ensure that Community and national law is properly implemented and applied."
"The single market offers advantages for consumers."
"Policyholders should be able to rely on their financial institutions and the fact that their solvency is ensured."
"We must ensure that consumers have viable means of redress."
"I look forward to the committee’s recommendations on the problems experienced by policyholders in various Member States and how they could be avoided."
"However, I would not accept that the Equitable Life affair calls into question the basis of internal market in the insurance sector."
"As Lord Penrose stated in his report on the affair, the origins of this crisis go back many years."
"National supervision is constantly developing and improving, whilst at European level the Solvency II project will provide a more coordinated and risk-based system."
"But no system can be guaranteed to prevent all market problems."
"I think we should avoid a more or less useless debate on host versus home state control."
"Host state control would not have made a difference in this case."
"In a single market, supervisors should cooperate."
"Both supervisors have roles to play."
"However, I certainly agree that we should not and cannot accept a ‘passing the buck’ attitude."
"That is definitely something that we need to address."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"As a company, Equitable Life was in financial trouble for a long time."
"However, the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders."
"What is worse, new policyholders were solicited and presented with a false impression of a company with a secure future in which their funds would prosper."
"The regulators failed."
"In 2001, Equitable Life lost a case in the UK that made it impose exit penalties on UK policyholders, though money for Irish policyholders was supposed to be ring-fenced and safe."
"Despite this, two years later in 2003, exit penalties worth about 20% of the value of Equitable Life policies were imposed on Irish policyholders."
"The regulators failed."
"Since this time Irish Equitable Life policyholders have lost their investment, which in many cases means their life savings."
"They have been denied justice by the UK, Irish and EU authorities though they are entitled to redress and protection when regulators fail."
"Their case has been before this Parliament’s Committee on Petitions for a year and a half."
"It is time for this Parliament to stand by the victims of failed regulatory mechanisms and to insist that an equitable settlement be finalised for the policyholders of Equitable Life."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"- A6-0170/2006 by Mr Muscat, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on further consolidation in the financial services industry (2006/2081(INI));"
"- the oral question (O-0069/2006 B6-0317/2006) by Mrs Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on mergers and acquisitions developments around Europe’s stock exchanges."
", ."
"The issues brought up by the debate we have before us are many, important and sensitive."
"For this reason, I choose to begin by immediately giving attention to the main emphasis of this report, on which a wide convergence has significantly been reached in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We have four messages to put across."
"First of all, we acknowledge the consolidation process in the field of financial services as one which has so far had positive economic effects."
"Secondly, it is the justly regulated, transparent market, free of unjustified obstacles, which decides what the level of consolidation should be."
"Thirdly, our role as legislators is to ensure that this process, particularly the acquisition and the merging of banks, leads to greater competition and not to the creation of new monopolies."
"Fourthly, competition should mean a true and wider choice among quality products and services, reaching the broadest possible spread of consumers."
"In my opinion, consumers should be the ones who benefit from the possible advantages of this process."
"I do care that financial institutions gain from consolidation, but I am much more interested in the greatest benefits going to the consumer, in the form of wider choice, better products, more efficient services and more competitive prices."
"By consumers, we mainly understand individuals and families, especially those who are more vulnerable."
"However, to these we should add companies, above all small and medium-sized companies which are the core of our economy, and which should be given the service they deserve."
"At this point, those who share my social ideal may find themselves confused."
"Yes, it is good that consumers have more benefits thanks to consolidation, but should it be the workers of financial organisations who pay the price?"
"We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that this problem does not exist."
"News about the acquisition and merging of companies often does not excite workers with the new prospects that this may entail for them."
"On the contrary, we cause them to worry that the money-saving moves being mentioned, and those yet to be mentioned, take place at the expense of their working conditions, or even worse, at the expense of their job."
"Is there no solution at all?"
"I have no doubt that serious institutions look to other methods of efficiency before considering turning towards the workers, but there are some who do not set the example of social responsibility towards the community."
"The point we surely need to support is the one which workers' representatives from around Europe made with me: that is, the need for them to be informed and involved in the process as early as possible."
"There is another point related to this."
"Countries' economies, especially those in transition or in the process of developing, are not simply a cow which is there to be milked."
"Corporations have the duty to truly invest in these countries, with the creation of new and better work opportunities which provide access to a higher quality of service."
"The new environment being formed in the field of financial services will push vital questions onto us as legislators, among them the issue of supervision."
"Many of the national authorities are doing an excellent job, but the issue is much bigger than this."
"Given the shape that the market is taking, is the field of supervision still good enough to protect delicate interests, such as those of the economy and of consumers?"
"There are many different answers to this question, even among ourselves."
"Nevertheless, we need to begin discussing them, and not leave them on the shelf."
"If we do not begin to deal with these questions, the danger will be that in the not-so-distant future, when a crisis may arise, we will not have the tools to face it, whatever these tools may be."
"It is also for this reason that the main recommendation of the report is to ask for a committee of independent experts, so that in a period of six months from when the mandate begins, it provides us alternative proposals which we can consider before taking decisions in this field."
"It would be remiss of me not to end my intervention by thanking all those who helped in the drafting of this report."
"Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the representatives of the other groups for the proactive way in which we worked."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Charlie McCreevy and his Cabinet for always being ready to discuss."
"I also thank those who took the time to put forward their opinions on the report, the secretariat of the Socialist Group, and the secretariat of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, fellow colleagues, I believe that we have a concrete, balanced and positive report, which can send a strong signal that the European Parliament has a clear vision for this sector, which is of such importance to our economies and to our citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thought it necessary, at this stage, to put an oral question on the state of discussions concerning mergers and acquisitions developments around Europe’s stock exchanges."
"I said Europe’s stock exchanges because we in this Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have for many years now been working for the construction, consolidation and integration of a European financial market, and I think the question we are faced with today is really whether or not there should be European stock exchanges."
"We as legislators cannot in fact be interested in every segment of the financial market, since this question, no doubt the most fundamental, is solely a matter of strategy for the market players."
"The issue lies beyond that: it is an issue of public interest that the legislator needs to take hold of and to which the Commission, as the holder of the legislative initiative, cannot remain indifferent."
"The situation of the stock exchanges today reminds me of the history of the euro, and I want to draw your attention here to something we all need to remember: without political intervention, that is if it had been left to market forces alone, the euro would not exist today, or else it would be quite different from what it now is: a currency that inspires confidence, that is shared by so many Member States and that so many Member States aspire to adopt."
"What we need for the stock exchanges is a solution in the same spirit as the euro: a solution whose conception goes beyond mere market forces and market logic."
"From this point of view, Commissioner, you who have the law-making initiative have a tremendous responsibility."
"That is something, of course, that you share with Mrs Kroes, who has her own responsibilities in the field of competition."
"What concerns observers and many parliamentarians today, however, is that the Commission, despite its power of initiative, remains content to arbitrate between opposing interests, analysing market situations and assessing the chances of getting a text passed in the Council, instead of trying to rise above all that and take a European perspective."
"From this point of view I believe we must follow the negotiations about stock exchange restructuring very closely because there is one point, Commissioner, and you are as aware of this as I am, that very much determines the state of those negotiations: it is not what happens on the securities market, but what happens in the back office – a question that has been before the Commission for years."
"A number of us in Parliament thought we ought to deal with the back office at the same time as talking about the market."
"Some, because it corresponded to their market strategy, wanted to keep the two separate."
"They now have the text on the market and think that competition ought to reign supreme in the back office."
"Some of the questions raised will not, however, be resolved by market forces alone, because the market cannot take everyone’s interests into account."
"Last time this Parliament expressed an opinion on this subject, it said it was waiting for an impact study before deciding whether a legislative initiative was necessary."
"That impact study is in your hands, Commissioner, but you have not yet allowed us to see it."
"The wildest rumours are circulating, suggesting that you might go so far as to amend the text of that impact study before reporting to us on it."
"I think this debate will allow you to enlighten us on all these points, Commissioner."
"My colleagues will be addressing other matters."
"There are nevertheless two points to which I would again like to draw your attention in conclusion."
"First the consequences of the following decisions at European level, consequences that have not been thought through or anticipated: one, the quotation of the stock markets; two, the withdrawal of the institutional investors – the big banks and insurance companies – which will have been the first to make their profits, leaving the door open for what are called the hedge funds to be the main players on the European stock exchanges."
"Then, I will draw your attention to the questions of supervision and corporate governance."
"We can in fact see that a merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext could be to the detriment of any European governance."
"."
"Mr President, in the few minutes I have this evening, I am going to follow current financial trends and consolidate my opening remarks in covering both Mr Muscat’s report and the oral question by Mrs Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As I emphasised during the hearing organised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in January, the real debate cannot be on more or less cross-border consolidation."
"That is for the market players to decide, not the politicians."
"Rather, the core of the debate is on how to create the optimal regulatory and prudential framework for the European financial sector to thrive, delivering concrete and substantial benefits to the consumers and boosting economic growth and job creation."
"That is why I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, and members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their work."
"With such complex issues, it is not always easy to identify the real questions, to take into account all the different points of view and strike the right balance to set the way forward."
"Thanks to the rapporteur’s open, transparent and inclusive approach, the report does just that."
"It brings a substantial contribution to the debate."
"I believe that there is a broad consensus on the main obstacles identified, shared by the Council conclusions adopted by the Ecofin Council in May."
"We must improve the cost efficiency of the supervision of cross-border activities."
"In that respect, as noted in the report, further convergence of supervisory practices and standards is essential."
"To achieve this objective, we do not need a supervisory ‘big bang’, but rather to optimise the functioning of the Lamfalussy structure."
"There are concrete projects that can be implemented rather soon."
"The role of the Level 3 Committees is essential, for instance to implement common reporting standards and thus avoid costly and unnecessary duplicative requirements."
"A number of such concrete improvements have been identified and were endorsed by the Ecofin Council last May."
"I would like to give a push to accelerating work in this area."
"We cannot have an internal market if companies are going to have to keep under-utilised capital tied up because we do not have in place sufficient cooperation between supervisors."
"I intend to come back to that in the time ahead."
"There is a regulatory and supervisory cost that should be evaluated."
"The report rightly underlines the implications of increasing integration for supervision."
"Some complex questions, such as deposit guarantee schemes or the issue of lender of last resort, must be re-examined in that context."
"The Commission’s White Paper on financial services policy has identified those questions."
"This will surely be one of the most interesting policy debates for the coming months and years."
"Besides supervision, the fragmentation of retail markets must also be addressed."
"The current difficulties in selling similar retail products in different countries is a major stumbling block in exploiting scale synergies."
"I fully agree with the report that further integration, notably in the retail market segments, should not occur to the detriment of consumers."
"We have means to prevent that from happening and we will use them."
"The ongoing sectoral inquiries, under the supervision of my colleague Commissioner Kroes, are a good example."
"A third area calling for our attention is the one related to impediments to corporate reorganisation on a pan-European basis."
"We are currently consulting on future priorities for company law and corporate governance to identify how we could make further progress."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur again for his work."
"We now have a shared analysis of what the main obstacles are."
"Our challenge for the coming years will be to remove them."
"Turning to the oral question by Mrs Berès, let me be clear: the Commission believes strongly that market forces and shareholder choices should determine the optimal shape of exchange consolidation – not bureaucrats, not politicians."
"We should not be in the business of ‘picking winners’ or trying to shape markets according to a bureaucratic vision of what is best for European shareholders, investors and issuers."
"In the long run, European investors and European corporations seeking to raise capital will be best served by world-class institutions doing business in a world-class regulatory framework deploying cutting-edge technology and able to provide the breadth and range of services they want."
"Those services might include the ability to trade in a multitude of currencies, time-zones and instruments."
"There are strong commercial pressures driving consolidation."
"If a deal makes commercial sense, and if the competition law and regulatory aspects can be adequately dealt with, then we will not stand in the way."
"However – and this is the key point – the Commission considers that it is essential that financial market business in the jurisdiction of the European Union is regulated by European and Member State rules, and by our regulators."
"Of course we will be very vigilant to ensure that current levels of investor protection and market integrity will be maintained."
"We believe in strong and effective regulation of European marketplaces."
"Otherwise, we would not all have put so much effort into getting the MiFID right, as well as the other aspects of the Financial Services Action Plan that we have laboured on for so long together."
"We note the preliminary assessment from some regulators in Europe and the United States that the mergers being discussed will not mean significant changes of regulatory responsibility."
"But if there are any spillovers, regulators should work out constructively together what the rules are going to be and how to cooperate."
"I will be maintaining close contact with the college of Euronext supervisors in the time ahead so as to ensure there is a full understanding about how all these issues will evolve."
"So there is no question of imposing new, extra-territorial burdens on European businesses that would put us at a disadvantage and jeopardise our internationally successful and developing financial markets."
"We know European users and shareholders do not favour that either."
"On competition issues, the Commission’s competences in merger assessment are laid down in the EC Merger Regulation No 139/2004."
"Within this framework, it is up to the parties in the first instance to inform the Commission as to whether, in their view, the relevant turnover thresholds are met for Community competence."
"The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext have informed us that this transaction would not meet these thresholds."
"On clearing and settlement issues, in the course of our work we have been trying to determine the best range of measures – legislative or not – that will deliver improved competitiveness in these areas."
"As regards the steps needed to deliver those benefits, the Commission has not yet taken a decision."
"All options remain on the table; a decision will probably be taken shortly."
"Mr President, I need hardly say that I very much welcome the report on further consolidation measures in the financial-services industry, which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I should also like to convey my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for our constructive cooperation."
"The consolidation of the banking sector among most of the EU Member States is not so far advanced as it is within some individual countries."
"In accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, the financial-services industry has to take the lead here, and it is aware of this and is willing to play its part."
"How is the European banking sector structured? Where do its strengths lie, and why has little consolidation taken place in Europe?"
"I welcome the initial studies of these matters conducted by the Commission."
"Regardless of whether we are considering the financial-services industry, education systems, the linguistic landscape or regional differences, Europe’s strength has always lain in its diversity."
"In the realm of financial services, this has three main implications: firstly, a financial-services sector that is working for European business will necessarily comprise diverse operators, namely those whose size enables them to face up to international challenges and those that are mostly concerned with regional markets."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are active in these selfsame regional markets, where they account for the bulk of Europe’s economic potential."
"This diversity must be preserved within the European Union, and I am pleased that we have addressed this point clearly in our report through the amendment tabled by Mrs Berès and others."
"Secondly, what does a pluralist banking structure mean in the European Union?"
"It means nothing more than institutions in France, Spain, Hungary and so on being able to follow different business models with different commercial aims. Which model or aim succeeds is left to market forces."
"Perhaps this is just another of those areas where Member States can adopt diverse approaches rather than seeking the ideal way."
"Thirdly, European consumers differ in their cultures and lifestyles and will therefore demand different financial services too."
"Only a variety of products can guarantee effective and efficient financial services in Europe that are tailored to the needs of consumers and the economy."
"The hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is also mentioned in this report."
"The report backs the European financial-services industry in its efforts to remove the real obstacles to cross-border consolidation."
"There has also been positive feedback from the European Central Bank."
"."
"Mr President, although the Muscat report and the oral question we have accurately reflect my concerns about the developments, of the questions we have asked with regard to the developments in stock exchanges, Commissioner McCreevy has only really answered the first part of Question 2, namely whether we should infer from the silence surrounding these developments that you really think that this is only a matter for the shareholders."
"That is apparently your opinion, and I should like to stress that it is one that I do not share."
"I think that you certainly cannot say that it is only a matter for the shareholders."
"There are many other stakeholders with major interests, including users of the stock exchanges, companies who are listed on them, private and institutional investors, as well as pension funds that invest via the stock exchanges, but also financial institutions that offer alternative investment routes have their own interests, and I am referring here to the investment banks with in-house dealerships offering alternative platforms, and the hedge funds."
"I do not know whether you are familiar with the book by Mr Seifert, former CEO of the ."
"In it, he describes very accurately how hedge funds, based on other interests, have also exercised their shareholders’ rights within the battle surrounding the proposals which the made at the time in an attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange."
"I do not know whether you read German, or whether a translation is now available, but it would be good to take on board the advice from somebody with first-hand experience in converting a stock exchange, which the users owned, to a listed company, and who can now also see the drawbacks of this pure shareholder’s mentality."
"I think that you will need to focus more on the general interest that is at stake."
"As politicians, it is incumbent upon us to consider this public interest, and that is clearly a task at European, rather than just national, level."
"It is certainly not my intention to elicit from you the combination that would work best and whether it should be a European or transatlantic stock exchange."
"I do think, though, that it is up to the Commission to prescribe the conditions, and what is needed based on the interests of those other stakeholders, the users, of the European economy."
"With regard to this transatlantic dimension, you have already stated that we should not adopt the rules of the United States."
"In that respect too, there are various experts, including Harvey Pitt and Callum McCarthy who indicate that this is certainly not that cut-and-dried."
"Accordingly, what we expect from the Commission is clear answers as to what the consequences are and how we can prevent this American influence from extending into possible constellations in Europe."
"As a final remark further to the Muscat report, I should like to stress our proposal to set up a committee of wise men."
"I think that we need to bring about European supervision as a matter of desperate urgency."
"The stock exchanges are an example of a sector where that is very much needed."
"Similarly, the consolidation of financial institutions elsewhere demonstrates that we cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with at national level alone, because other interests would then come into play."
"Clearly, in this globalising economy, we urgently need a European outlook and European supervision, and it would be great if a committee of wise men were to advise you in this respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whatever may be said to the contrary, the single market has not yet been completed."
"Financial services is one of the main areas where further improvements are possible and necessary."
"You, Commissioner McCreevy, are trying to change this state of affairs."
"The European Parliament is happy to support you in this venture."
"The Muscat report gives the House an opportunity today to throw its weight firmly behind the immediate removal of unwarranted obstacles to mergers and acquisitions."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Muscat warmly on a very balanced report and thank him for the open and constructive cooperation."
"The political frontier between two Member States of the European Union must not be a barrier to cross-border mergers or acquisitions."
"The decision to merge with or acquire a company should not be a political matter but should depend solely on whether the merger or takeover will benefit shareholders and staff as well as customers and business partners in Europe or round the globe and will thereby make the companies in question more competitive."
"On no account, however, must a merger or acquisition infringe EU competition law."
"In short, the task of politicians – as Commissioner McCreevy has said – cannot be to decide whether more or fewer mergers will take place but only to ensure that the whole system is not thrown out of balance."
"With regard to the possible merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext, I take the view, unlike the previous speaker, that politicians should not play an active role here."
"They must only draw a line where it becomes apparent that American attitudes to supervision are suddenly establishing themselves in Europe through this merger."
"That possibility cannot entirely be dismissed if we consider that even money-market transactions between European parties are increasingly being conducted, to all intents and purposes, in accordance with US market legislation."
"Unwarranted barriers of a fiscal or supervisory nature must be removed."
"At the request of the Ecofin Council, the Commission has been working to identify the precise nature of these barriers."
"As a concrete result of these efforts, let me cite the forthcoming publication of the amendment to Article 16 of the Banking Directive."
"Supervisory authorities must, of course, have teeth."
"In Article 16, however, the grounds on which the competent supervisory authority can reject a cross-border merger or takeover are too vaguely defined."
"Assessment based on the ‘fit and proper’ test leaves the supervisory authority a great deal of scope to interpret the criteria and is therefore open to abuse."
"Recent cases have clearly illustrated this defect."
"Transparency, logical decisions and hence predictability for companies are aspects that we shall have to discuss over the coming months."
"As the parliamentary rapporteur on these issues, I await the Commission’s proposals with particular interest."
"Lastly, let me make a few comments on the tabled amendments."
"I support Mr Muscat’s proposal for the appointment of a committee of wise men to examine the effects of consolidation and to study issues of supervision and supervisory law, of financial stability and of crisis management."
"I also consider it right and proper that the committee be given six months to compile an authoritative report with specific proposals on the issues that have been highlighted."
"My own amendments are designed to make the draft somewhat more impartial."
"It is about the single European market and the removal of unwarranted barriers."
"In other words, Parliament must not seek to set the specific situation in a Member State in tablets of stone or to change such a situation at all costs."
"Let us ensure that the industry and consumers are given the single market they desperately need. This is the only route to success in the global marketplace."
"."
"Mr President, the Muscat report applauds the consolidation and merger and acquisition activity that has been taking place in pursuit of these elusive economies of scale and scope."
"However, I am not aware of any evidence that consumers are more satisfied, that risks have been reduced or that the cost of capital has been reduced."
"On the contrary, the main effects of the financial services action plan to date seem to be that financial services at all levels – retail banking, stockbroking, investment banking – are all being rather seriously hampered by onerous and largely unnecessary reporting requirements."
"However, the issue I want to highlight – and which the report acknowledges – is crisis management, or, to put it more bluntly, who bails out."
"Sooner or later some large multinational bank is going to get into difficulties, not necessarily through bad management, but simply because banks, like any other business, can go bust."
"Banking, like any other business, is risky."
"There will be calls for bail-outs and guarantees to forestall contagion and to prevent the breakdown of the payment system."
"At that point, cooperation between the national authorities becomes non-cooperation, as each national authority strives to limit its own financial liability."
"Nobody has thought this through."
"The report mentions the lender of last resort without telling us what it is or how it is going to work."
"So, instead of the blind pursuit of the single market in financial services, I believe it would be prudent not to encourage any more consolidation or cross-border merger activity for the present, until such time as the European Union has a single fiscal authority to take the potentially large financial responsibility when things go wrong."
"Fortunately, I think that time is very far in the future."
"Mr President, I should like, if I may, to agree with my party colleague’s, Mr Hoppenstedt’s, views and, especially, with his appreciative remarks about the work done by the rapporteur."
"I think there are three important things to say in this connection."
"Firstly, experience of consolidation in the financial market has been positive."
"It might, if anything, be said that there is too little cross-border consolidation."
"Where we have seen such consolidation, it has been an expression of genuine cross-border integration and produced sound conditions for consumers and customers."
"Another thing that it is important to say in this connection is that, when we debate the situation in Europe, we should do so with the global financial market in mind."
"We need not only strong European players but also strong players in Europe if we are to have both ready access to capital, notably for investment purposes, and a powerful financial dynamic."
"It is in this context that it is important for major companies to be able to develop in Europe, and it is, therefore, also important to welcome the consolidation we see."
"In this connection, I should also like to point out that it is important for the European economy to develop the transatlantic market."
"Irrespective of what develops as regards the transatlantic issue of European and US stock exchanges or purely European ones, it is important to exploit the opportunity we now have."
"We have an interest in, as far as possible, upholding European rules when it comes to reporting, sound company management and common rules governing competition."
"I should like to call on the Commission not to intervene in the discussions about transatlantic stock exchange mergers and not to steer matters in one particular direction or another."
"Instead, it should use these discussions to emphasise European rules, the implementation of which could give European financial markets a strong position in the global economy."
"That is an opportunity of which we must take advantage now."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to join with all those who have congratulated Mr Muscat on his report on consolidation in financial services and particularly on his proposal to create a committee of ‘wise men’."
"I shall refer primarily to the phenomena of mergers and acquisitions in European stock exchanges."
"For the last thirty years, technological development, the free movement of capital at international level and financial innovation have led to profound changes in the capital markets and have increased domestic savers’ participation in the financial markets, in general, and in the stock market in particular."
"In some European countries their participation is equivalent to around a third of their savings and in others a fifth."
"The demutualisation of stock exchanges, which began in Asia in the middle of the 90s and then at the beginning of this decade spread to the main European centres of London, Paris and Frankfurt, and is still taking place, as is currently happening in Spain with the process of public offerings, has led to restructurings and to concentrations in the internal market, as in the case of Euronex and the Scandinavian market."
"All of these are positive developments, since they lead to reductions in costs and the extension of transactions and the quotations markets."
"In my view, the recent announcements of transatlantic mergers and acquisitions represent a qualitative change."
"I say this because, despite the increasing convergence taking place on each side of the Atlantic, substantial differences remain between the two markets, which have been identified both in the model of the stock market and in the actual structure of the market and in the elements of post-negotiation."
"Furthermore, this is happening at a time when the European Union, having approved the MiFID and when it is going to be applied in the future, intends to complete the European financial market."
"At the same time, an important debate has begun on the updating of the stock markets."
"This debate relates to their role in the future, to organisation, structures, transparency, economic aspects, competence, governance and infrastructures."
"This is a time of very significant changes."
"There are therefore many questions to be cleared up and it is not just a matter of simply acting on a case-by-case basis. Rather, we must identify the European Union’s general interests, assess the impact of the operations announced on those interests, consider the consequences of the operations from political, legislative and economic points of view and, of course, seek the best necessary response, bearing in mind that the financial policy and the stock market policy have a significant impact on the European Union’s monetary policy."
"I also believe that we must assess the best method for ensuring transparency, stability and balance on the part of the European Union with a view to the proper global operation of the financial markets."
"That is the task that we must carry out."
"Mr President, I too would like to explore the transatlantic mergers of the stock exchanges."
"We have seen on the front page of the Financial Times several times and heard from the head of the New York Stock Exchange that it is possible the US Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance rules could apply to the merged exchange, with jurisdiction in US courts."
"Of course not everybody agrees with that analysis."
"Indeed, at the New York Stock Exchange’s second annual securities conference a couple of weeks ago, Commissioner Annette Nazareth of the US Securities and Exchange Commission said that the merger seemed to call for a common technology strategy but not a common exchange platform."
"So there will be a common holding company under US jurisdiction, but Euronext would not register as a US exchange and would not offer its products on the US market."
"On that basis, Sarbanes-Oxley, in her opinion, would not apply to Euronext."
"However, it would seem to me that neither would the benefits of a merged market, at least from the Euronext side."
"In fact she said a mere affiliation with a US exchange does not subject a non-US exchange to US law."
"However, with all the excitement and interest in cross-Atlantic acquisitions, it seems likely that perhaps something more momentous than a mere affiliation was afoot, at least in the minds of some."
"Is it possible that some kind of asymmetric process, with the US base parts registering in Europe but not vice versa, may occur?"
"What would be the consequences for the European market?"
"Commissioner Nazareth was very careful with her words in referring to the technology platform."
"Is it in fact practical for there to be separate IT platforms in the long term?"
"I doubt it."
"There would be a desire to integrate and at that stage it would seem Sarbanes-Oxley would surely come into play, which was why she was so careful with her words."
"Therefore, unless steps are taken to reach an international standard sooner rather than later, there could well be problems ahead."
"I would say there is a role for the bureaucrats here as well as the shareholders."
"In Europe we have experience of having to balance different legal traditions and practices and that is one reason we should be taking the lead in the future of regulation."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Muscat and all those who took part in the preparation of the report, which required a considerable amount of thorough work, and produced a balanced document."
"I believe that there are two factors that have a significant influence on the consolidation of financial processes."
"One of them is, with reference to the Lisbon process, the building of the internal market and the increase in competitiveness."
"The other, with reference to enlargement and alongside the advantages of expanding the market, is the implementation of cohesion, as well as equality and unity between Member States."
"Unfortunately, in respect of the latter, the balance has been upset."
"This is due to the fact that while in financial processes the sensitivity of new Member States is pushed to the background with the declaration of increased opening-up, the determinant factor in the case of labour-intensive services is the sensitivity of old Member States, rather than internal liberalisation."
"This overturns the balance in the services sector."
"Incidentally, this is why I cannot accept the consideration of social or environmental protection aspects in the consolidation of financial services or of the financial sector."
"Additionally, I believe that it is important that we move forward with some regard for solidarity."
"We should not allow the development of a situation where market supervisory authorities in recipient states – and new Member States are basically recipient states – are defenceless against the dominant market supervisory authorities of old Member States."
"We can only move forward in the area of liberalisation if we impose strict requirements for cooperation, and, in particular, for transparency."
"At the same time, I agree that in order to facilitate concentration, we must help change the tax systems, and in particular the VAT regime."
"I would also like to stress that the over-concentration resulting from mergers and acquisitions should be analysed both from the perspective of the emerging internal market and for the sake of the cohesion of Member States trying to catch up."
"This is required because in some situations it may happen that there is no over-concentration at Community level, but it is present at Member State level, which is damaging to competition in that Member State."
"Therefore, competition policy impact assessments must pay particular attention to this, as signalled by recent examples."
"Accurate procedures will be able to resolve this difficult situation, and will also be able to ensure that oligopolistic conditions are truly excluded, without allowing them to be replaced by unilateral protectionism."
"– Commissioner, I am very sorry that today, you did not understand why we raised this question and invited you to this Chamber."
"It certainly was not because we wanted more market rules, but because we lack political leadership backed up by the European Union's strategic guidelines for financial market development."
"We all know very well that the European Union has fine traditions of principles-based financial regulation."
"These principles must be proclaimed."
"We miss the declaration of these principles, and because of this feel confused in the market which leads to various rumours, various opinions."
"Hopefully, now that we have an excellent European model, which developing markets also follow readily, we will be able to protect it; however, at the moment, it seems that the Commission's, forgive me, hesitation is allowing that model to be washed away."
"Take, for example, those prospectus directive amendments which are now being debated."
"It seems that we are waiting for some sort of intermediate result – a transatlantic average, which will not mean anything good for either Europe or the USA."
"In truth, we ought to say honestly that we have different views and perhaps then we can try to respect and recognise each other's position."
"Talking of clearing and settlement market regulation, we must recognise that this is a complex matter which perhaps needs to be solved gradually."
"We should also have our own European view and not align ourselves with decisions made by large conglomerates."
"Because doing nothing is not a liberal position."
"When the regulator does nothing, then the law of the jungle takes root in the market and the market is ruined, and most importantly innovations are ruined, which we really do not want."
"Mr President, many colleagues have already asked what we are doing today in discussing stock exchange mergers in Europe."
"Of course it is not for the European Parliament to decide on the kinds of mergers that can occur and the kind of activity on the market."
"It is also up to the Commission to make judgements on whether the Euronext-Frankfurt Börse merger is better than the transatlantic one."
"We need to look at the kinds of opportunities the transatlantic merger might give us, especially in terms of the transatlantic financial services dialogue which, I think, has been the most fruitful example of what we can do together if we really cooperate with the US SCC."
"I want to congratulate the Commissioner on the amount of progress made."
"I think if the market forces decide that we will have a transatlantic stock exchange, that will be a huge opportunity for regulatory convergence."
"It is not about extra-territorial Sarbanes Oxley rules coming to Europe; the point is also that we can put forward our strategic models, our very good technological platforms and put them to very effective use in the US."
"We have been negotiating, for example, about the issue of electronic trading screens in the GATS negotiations."
"We have been trying to get our trading screens to US stock markets and vice versa, but this has not happened."
"That kind of transatlantic stock exchange merger would be a huge opportunity for regulatory convergence and allow the job that has been done so well to continue in the future."
"Mr President, I only have two points."
"The first is: is there anything in the wording of paragraphs 9 and 26 that in any way gives comfort to the Berlin savings banks and the German savings banks system that they will be in any way stultified for the future?"
"I ask that question of Mr McCreevy."
"The second is whether we really think that yet another committee of wise men – asked for in the last paragraph – is necessary to look at this."
"."
"Mr President, a range of issues has been brought up this evening."
"I believe I have covered most of them in my introductory remarks, but let me stress a few points."
"A lot of effort has gone into creating a harmonised legal framework for the EU’s financial markets. Indeed, a lot of work is still being done on that."
"The framework is aimed at creating a level playing field, promoting deeper and more liquid markets and ensuring that consumers’ and investors’ interests are safeguarded."
"Within that framework, we should allow the market to play its role."
"Regulators should steer away from intervening in decisions taken by market players."
"The fact that European companies are coveted by operators from other countries is a sign of the confidence they have in us and in our regulatory model."
"What we need are strong financial institutions that can stand their own in the global economy."
"We need state-of-the-art exchanges, and competition policy ensures that undue concentration and abuses of dominant positions are avoided."
"But beyond that, I believe that we should allow the market to play its role."
"Mrs van den Burg raised a number of questions."
"She said that in her opinion it was not just a decision for the shareholders – referring to stock exchanges."
"Well, I believe it is."
"I do not agree with her."
"I agree with her that users of exchanges have an interest, but I have not noted any degree of consensus between them as to what they consider to be the best and most desirable combination of exchanges."
"She also raised the question of the consequences of the possible mergers."
"It is too early to tell, but I made it clear that consolidation of exchanges should not lead to what I call ‘regulatory spill-over’."
"That issue has been referred to by other speakers too, such as Mr Klinz and others."
"As I said in my opening remarks, in reply to Mrs Berès’ question on behalf of the committee, there are two separate issues."
"It is a matter, in my view, for the stakeholders and shareholders to decide what they want to do with their stock exchanges."
"That is a matter entirely for them."
"The market should decide that."
"On the other hand, the question of our regulation is of great interest to us."
"We want to ensure that European regulators regulate European exchanges, and as I understand it, the proposal put to the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext will ensure a system where that will be allowed."
"I agree that it will be important to ensure that this remains the situation into the future – not just this year or next year, but four or five years hence – and that whatever procedures are put in place, they have to be followed through."
"As I said in m opening remarks, yes, we are taking an interest in that and will be involved in it."
"Mrs van den Burg asked if I had read Mr Seifert’s book."
"I have not, but I have read various comments about it."
"I met Mr Seifert early on in my time as European Commissioner, just after he launched the tentative takeover by Frankfurt of the London Stock Exchange."
"I have read what he said in his book."
"Whereas the book is interesting, it is just one perspective on the subject."
"I should like to say to Members of this House and others outside, who always seem to be concerned about outside influences contaminating the European experience, that I believe that some of the proposals on the table at present suggest to me that market players worldwide seem to want to be involved in the European experience and see it somewhat in the other way."
"Evidence seems to suggest that a lot of business is now done in Europe that used to be done on the other side of the Atlantic."
"There is a reason for that."
"Some people want to get involved in the European way."
"We should not always be so defensive."
"Mr Hökmark and others referred to the regulatory matter."
"I would agree with what they say."
"We should let European rules and regulations apply to European companies."
"That is what our interest is going to be."
"The question of whether there should be takeovers or mergers of stock exchanges in different parts of the world is entirely a matter for the market players and one about which I am entirely agnostic."
"Mr President, I am astonished at the Commissioner’s response."
"Some very precise questions were put to him."
"We are not asking him to intervene in the reality of the markets, we are asking him to play his part in initiating legislation."
"Failing to take a decision has an effect on the markets."
"Not taking decisions about decoupling or the application of the competition rules in a particular market affects the definition of the framework."
"We also asked you specific questions about the impact assessment."
"When will Parliament be able to have this impact assessment, before it has been totally rewritten by your services, Commissioner?"
"Mr President, I do not think my question on the consolidation of the banking sector and whether there was anything in the Muscat report that could give comfort to the stultifying of the savings bank structure in Germany was answered."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0217/2006) by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 to maritime transport, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 as regards the extension of its scope to include cabotage and international tramp services (COM(2005)0651 C6-0046/2006 2005/0264(CNS))."
"."
"Mr President, it is my pleasure to join you tonight for this discussion on the report by Mr Wortmann-Kool on the Commission’s proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) No 4056/86."
"The Commission is very pleased with the report’s recognition that price- fixing liner conferences are no longer justified in today’s market conditions, either legally or economically."
"The thrust of our proposal is to increase EU competitiveness, much in keeping with the Lisbon agenda."
"Roughly 18% of imports and 21% of EU exports are affected by carriers’ ability to fix prices jointly under the liner conference block exemption."
"The repeal of this block exemption will result in lower transport prices, engendering an overall benefit to the EU economy."
"That said, the Commission has also been concerned with preserving the competitiveness of the EU liner shipping industry."
"That is why we are preparing guidelines explaining how competition law will apply to the liner sector, once Regulation (EC) No 4056/86 is repealed."
"The Commission is committed to promulgating the guidelines by the end of 2007."
"In view of the two-year transitional period, the guidelines will be in place before the repeal of the liner conference block exemption takes effect, thus giving industry ample time to adjust to a new competitive environment in the knowledge that what it seeks to do is lawful."
"The Commission has been discussing closely with both the transport providers, carriers, and the transport users, shippers, on the content of the guidelines."
"The focus will be on ensuring the competitiveness of the transport sector."
"I think we all agree that ensuring competitiveness is not the same as shielding the sector from competition."
"Information exchanges are lawful and are common practice in most industries, because they enable business to make better decisions."
"However, they must not go so far as to prevent undertakings from determining their conduct in the market independently of each other."
"The process leading to the adoption of the guidelines by the Commission includes discussions with both transport users and transport providers, as well as with the Member States in the European Competition Network’s maritime transport subgroup."
"Draft guidelines will be published so that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment."
"Other institutions may also put forward comments during that time."
"In other cases, notably in the field of state aids, the European Parliament has used this opportunity to make its views known."
"We look forward to the European Parliament’s continued interest in this important initiative."
"I understand the concerns raised on international issues."
"I would like to reassure you that we are keeping our trading partners aware of our initiative, explaining the economic and legal reasons that underpin it."
"These contacts have so far been positive."
"There is a general acknowledgement that the repeal of the liner conference block exemption by the EU will not cause conflicts of law with third countries and that it is a process that responds to today’s market conditions."
"Overall, the Commission can take on board most of the amendments tabled."
"This should, however, not be in the form of recitals to a legislative text."
"I believe it should remain a clear and simple repeal of Regulation (EC) No 4056/86."
"However, your recommendations will be reflected in follow-up measures."
"These include the guidelines, as well as the information updates and the reassessment of other legislative texts such as Regulation (EC) No 954/79 on the accession to the UN Convention on the Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, to which the European Parliament has drawn the Commission’s attention."
"."
"Mr President, the maritime sector’s economic importance is considerable, and its growth potential enormous."
"Precisely at a time when globalisation develops at an ever quicker pace, those global transport flows and the effective handling of them are of key importance."
"European industry has an important and strong role to play in this."
"It is a sector that is becoming highly competitive, and it is in actual fact the only sector that is still exempt from the application of the Treaty's rules of competition."
"It is therefore high time we abolished this exemption."
"Consequently, this House pledges its support for Commissioner McCreevy’s proposal to repeal the present Regulation 4056/86."
"Legal uncertainty about the interpretation of competition rules is, however, something we want to avoid, and I am pleased that the Commissioner recognises this, because the Commission will, not least in the future, need to continue to take into consideration the specific characteristics of this internationally operating sector."
"That is why the rules should become clear in future."
"That is also the reason why this House would like to see clear guidelines drafted for the sector before the regulation is withdrawn."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has expressed the intention of doing so before the end of 2007 with regard to liner shipping."
"This House, though, since this criterion is an essential pillar in this proposal, believes that it should be explicitly mentioned in the legislative text."
"The sector must be given guaranteed legal certainty about what is, and is not, permitted in the present regulation."
"I am pleased to hear that you have entered into intensive debates with the sector."
"This House would also ask you, though, and will also do so explicitly tomorrow, to consult it about the content of the guidelines."
"Can you give your word that this House will be consulted on this matter?"
"This is, after all, often good practice in other areas too."
"I am pleased to say that, by the looks of things, we will, by a large majority, be able to send this powerful message to the Commission."
"This House sets great store by the fact that the Commission spells it out that other forms of cooperation, including the consortia block exemption, would continue to apply to this container liner shipping sector, because important operational agreements can be made in this respect, for example in terms of capacity."
"Whilst that is a necessity for this sector, this should, of course, always be subject to Article 81 of the Treaty."
"It is vitally important to ensure that this cooperation should run smoothly."
"With regard to cabotage and tramp services, the Commission suggests moving the enforcement of competition rules to European level."
"That is a logical step because the Treaty already applies at that level."
"Since this enforcement also belongs at European level, you can count on our support in this."
"Some Members of this House have proposed exempting cabotage, but I will not be supporting that view."
"Parliament would like to see guidelines drafted in the tramp sector too, because that sector, just like the other sectors, is also entitled to know where it stands."
"According to Parliament, guidelines should therefore be known in that area too before this legislation enters into effect."
"Clarity right from the start prevents all kinds of costly legal procedures which the sector can really do without."
"There are already examples of such cases in the tramp sector with regard to pool agreements."
"There have been complaints in that sector, and it is unclear to that sector how the Commission will go on from here."
"So, once again, this lack of clarity should be mitigated by guidelines in that sector too."
"The international dimension is, of course, vitally important to this internationally operating sector."
"We would therefore ask you – and fortunately you are already aware of this – to be very mindful of this international competitive position when the proposals are fleshed out further."
"That also applies to the repeal of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) code, and we look forward to receiving a report about those international developments so that we can follow them closely."
"Once again, we will be pledging our support, but the conditions are tough as nails as far as this House is concerned."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated the issue we are debating this evening."
"We have exchanged views with the European Commission within the framework of the White Paper, and in a resolution adopted by a large majority the European Parliament maintained that our merchant fleet, in the competitive and rapidly developing international environment, needs a clear framework for manoeuvre which must guarantee fair and healthy competition."
"Our economy and development plan are based on competition."
"However, it is up to us to predict the conditions and possible side effects and to create a suitable political framework."
"That is why we called on small and medium-sized shipping enterprises not to throw away opportunities and not to sacrifice their interests and their business plans to mergers and to the behemoths being created in the industry, especially on regular lines."
"We called for care to be taken to ensure that the market was not sent into shock by the European Commission's proposals and for gradual and creative adaptation to the new circumstances."
"We want our concerns to be taken seriously by the European Commission in all cases."
"My thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, whose opinion proposes solutions to the matter which I hope will be voted through and accepted by the European Commission."
"Allow me to reiterate the matters that concern us; they are the transitional period for proper adaptation to the new circumstances and clear guidelines."
"I agree with the rapporteur that cabotage should not be exempted from free competition."
"To close, I wish to highlight the lack of attention on the part of the European Commission to the international dimension of the matter, both as regards whether the UNCTAD code will apply and how the Member States will be able to change regime, and as regards the lack of detailed information on the dialogue with our partners China, Japan, Singapore and India, as regards their reaction to a possible change of regime."
"I would point out by way of example that Singapore has already announced that it will continue to maintain the conference system."
"This is therefore a point on which I expect a reply from the European Commission as to how the European Union will act."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for her work, both on my own behalf and on that of my friend Mr Savary, who was unable to be present to take part in this debate this evening and who has asked me to give you his apologies."
"It is a balanced report, and while it does not include all the views expressed by my group, it is still acceptable, since it stresses the most important things."
"It asks for the speedy publication of guidelines by the Commission so as to afford greater legal certainty to those providing international tramp and maritime cabotage services."
"It also points out that exchanges of information are important and may be beneficial for the stability and efficiency of these sectors."
"It brings useful detail and, lastly, gives particular importance to small operators."
"As a member of this Parliament’s Committee on Transport, I would nevertheless like to express a few regrets, stressing one point in particular."
"Together with my colleagues Mr Savary and Mr Sifunakis, I tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis of the text on which Parliament is to vote tomorrow morning."
"That amendment was rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"As a result, it could not be submitted for the vote in plenary."
"I deplore that."
"Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, which this regulation proposes to repeal, was adopted on a twofold legal basis: Articles 84 (transport policy) and 87 (competition) of the Treaty, now Articles 80 and 83."
"The proposed repeal takes up only Article 83 (competition)."
"That is a political choice with serious consequences."
"It in fact determines the procedure applicable and limits the powers of Parliament, since the legal basis relating to competition alone involves a consultation procedure."
"The legal basis relating to transport, on the other hand, would have resulted in a codecision procedure."
"In my opinion, that would have been preferable."
"While I think that competition may be stimulating and beneficial to the economy, I do not see it as a panacea and am not in favour of its blind and indiscriminate application to all sectors of the economy, with no regard to their specific nature or even the state they are in."
"Sadly, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition has sometimes given us the impression of defending that rather dogmatic outlook against all comers and especially against the opinion of other Commission services."
"Although it is a consultative document, I hope that this report will at all events give the Commission a better picture of the concerns of operators who are not against the idea of reform, but who would like some guarantees and guidance regarding the changes with which they will be faced."
"These are legitimate concerns, and all the more so because this sector is of fundamental importance for Europe’s future and its development."
". – Mr President, within the framework of the European Union's common shipping policy, shipping conferences have been set up as a form of union of regular line shipping companies with a view to controlling the strategic and profitable sector of maritime transport."
"These are similar in form but less advanced than the pools of chemical shipping companies which were set up later."
"Shipping conferences regulate the lines of ships' round trips, the ports they put into, the number of ships available for each line and the freightage charged."
"The argument that shipping conferences have supposedly brought about better and cheaper services for the workers is unsubstantiated."
"Inflation, poverty, unemployment, poorer and more commercialised services are the harsh reality which workers have to put up with."
"Shipping conferences were developed for the transportation of raw materials and in international trade in general, mainly between the northern European shore and shipping monopolies, and they secured huge, astronomical profits for euro-unifying capital."
"Today, the same business groups are calling for shipping conferences to be abolished and the European Commission agrees with this."
"The aim of the new legislative initiative is obviously to strengthen competitiveness, expand the insulting privileges of the euro-unifying monopolies engaged in maritime transport and allow them carte blanche to increase their profits."
"Today, the concentration of capital in this specific sector has advanced to such a degree that basically a few companies, which can be counted on the fingers of one hand, control transport on regular lines."
"Typically, one European container transport company operates 550 ships while, by contrast, a similar Asian company operates 112 ships."
"To talk of competition under these circumstances is pure hypocrisy."
"We do not agree that cabotage should come under competition rules, just as we do not agree with Regulation No 4050/86 or Regulation No 3577/92."
"The reactionary institutional framework for shipping, the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union is strengthening the implacability and insatiable lust of shipowners for profit and is creating serious political and social problems in Greece, France, Finland and Ireland."
"Of course, the Council and the European Commission, in collusion with employers, are pushing them towards the European Court of Justice."
"The point is that they will have to face them because the workers are not prepared to sell out their rights."
"Unequal pay for equal work, a heavier workload for maritime workers, the fact that ticket prices and freightage have gone through the roof, the reduction in schedule frequencies and the system of keeping overly old, under-maintained ships in coastal shipping are typical of domestic maritime transport."
"The application of the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 has already struck a heavy blow to maritime transport and caused serious problems for workers, passengers and residents, especially in isolated island regions."
"Maintaining the exemption of maritime transport conducted solely between ports of the same Member State from the application of the competition rules is of strategic importance to the economic development, social cohesion and national defence of these countries."
"Consequently, it is vital to maintain the exemption provided for in Article 32(b) of Regulation No 1/2003."
"That is why we propose Amendments 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 in this direction."
"In addition, the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 urgently needs to be abolished for coastal shipping."
"Maritime transport is a social necessity which cannot be satisfied within the framework of an anti-grassroots competition policy."

"Mr President, the Commission is very grateful for the hard work that has gone into the preparation of this report and for the excellent collaboration with our services."
"I believe that we have worked towards an initiative that will have an echo in the years to come in other jurisdictions as well."
"Liner shipping has been organised as a cartel, albeit legally, since the 1870s, not just in Europe but in most other industrial nations."
"By taking the step of examining market conditions carefully, we have all come to acknowledge that liner shipping is a highly competitive industry that does not need to be protected against competition."
"We are confident that our initiative will encourage our major trading partners to review whether their approach to this industry is correct and economically viable and, most importantly, our perseverance has convinced the industry that it does not need price-fixing."
"It is now considering in earnest how it can best adapt to a very competitive environment, fuelled by globalisation."
"Parliament’s contribution to this process has been significant."
"First, the Committee on Transport and Tourism produced an own-initiative report in December 2005, in response to the Commission’s White Paper, drawing our attention to several issues we had not considered before."
"We took those issues on board as we pursued our revision process."
"Then the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs set out its views after extensive discussions with my services."
"We are grateful for your work and the confidence you have shown in addressing these complex issues."
"We will respond to your suggestions in the coming months in several initiatives, for instance through information updates on the situation regarding the application of competition rules for liner shipping in third countries, the Commission guidelines on the application of EU competition law to the maritime transport services and a reassessment of other legislative texts on the validity of which you have raised doubts."
"We will consult widely and look forward to Parliament’s views on the guidelines."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0196/2006) by Mr Alvaro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds (COM(2005)0343 C6-0246/2005 2005/0138(COD))."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Alvaro, rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and Mr Bullmann, draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their outstanding efforts and readiness to reach an agreement on this technical and complex file."
"The proposal for a regulation on payer information accompanying the transfer of funds is an important step towards our aim of cutting off terrorist funding."
"It shows the EU’s determination to participate fully in the international efforts to combat terrorism."
"Nobody can deny that combating terrorism is a key political priority worldwide today."
"At European level, the commitment to combat all forms of terrorism is clear."
"The EU plan of action on combating terrorism defines as a priority close cooperation with the Financial Action Task Force and the adaptation of the EU legislative framework to the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing adopted by this body."
"The proposed regulation transposes into EU law Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force."
"This recommendation requires that money transfers be accompanied by the identity of the sender with name, address and account number."
"This regulation will facilitate the traceability of money transfers through a number of obligations."
"These obligations apply to payment service providers, mainly banks, but also money remitters."
"They will be obliged to send information on the payer throughout the payment chain and keep the corresponding records."
"This information shall be available to the national authorities in order to assist them in their tasks."
"It will help combating money laundering and terrorist financing."
"The agreed deadline for the implementation of this special recommendation is 1 January 2007."
"Non-coordinated action by Member States alone in the field of cross-border transfers of funds could have a significant negative impact on the smooth functioning of payment services at EU level."
"It would also damage the internal market in the field of financial services: hence the importance of respecting the deadline."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have worked hard during the last year to reach an agreement on the text."
"We all have done our best to find solutions to complex issues and I believe that we have been successful in doing so."
"One of the main topics of discussion in our negotiations has been the issue of the EUR 1000 threshold, below which receiving banks in the EU would not be obliged to reject a transfer or to ask the sending bank to complete the information on the payer."
"The Commission is pleased that this option has finally not been retained."
"This idea has also been rejected by all Member States in the Council."
"Terrorists can be financed by a series of small payments below the threshold."
"I consider this a valid concern if we want to tackle terrorism effectively."
"A solution has also been found with respect to the obligation of the receiving banks to stop dealings with foreign banks not sending the appropriate information, and on the obligation to send back low-value payments."
"I have noted Parliament’s concerns on these points."
"The circumstances under which these obligations apply have been restricted considerably, making them a solution of last resort."
"I am also happy to note that we have been successful in reaching agreement on technical issues, such as the use of systems with technical limitations by intermediaries receiving funds from outside the EU."
"Now that an overall agreement on comitology has been reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the adoption of this regulation is an excellent opportunity to put into practice that agreement."
"I am therefore appealing to the Members of this House not to insist on the inclusion of specific sunset clauses on the Commission’s regulatory powers under this regulation."
"All in all I think this proposal is ripe for adoption in a single reading and I hope it will receive support from all of you."
"This regulation provides us with means to combat terrorist financing in a consistent manner throughout the European Union."
"I look forward to hearing your comments."
"Mr President, I have exercised the right to sit nearer the front so that you do not have to keep looking up to the back rows, and it might make the debates in this House more lively if we moved closer together."
"After all, we want to ensure that we engage in proper parliamentary deliberation."
"I do not think I need dwell any longer on this technical point."
"Commissioner McCreevy explained very well what is essentially at stake here."
"He pointed out that we have an international obligation to fulfil Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force."
"He has dealt with the technical details, and for that reason I need hardly reiterate these."
"As he quite rightly said, we have achieved a balanced and reasonable compromise with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in collaboration with the Commission and the Council, a compromise which, as I see it and in the view of my committee, takes full account of the interests of data protection and data security as well as meeting the concerns of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Nevertheless, in the case of such reports, even those that come from international bodies, we should ask ourselves far more frequently whether they actually achieve anything."
"As this document has been on the table since last year and its existence has been common knowledge since some time around November 2005, I took the liberty of taking it with me on a trip to Israel, where I had talks with an expert at a university who specialises in the study of countermeasures to freeze the flow of funds to terrorists."
"He used to be an agent and a lieutenant in the Israeli armed forces and had worked for Mossad."
"He looked at this document and, to be perfectly honest, did not really see the value of it."
"I can quite understand his reaction."
"My own background is as follows: I have worked in a bank, and I have studied law."
"I know that terrorist funding does not involve Terrorist A going into a high street bank, depositing his money and hoping that someone will draw it from a bank based in Damascus."
"There are completely different ways of channelling funds to terrorists."
"We are perhaps closing a window of opportunity, and we shall no doubt catch some small fry as a result – so much seems certain – but it is not the proper sharp instrument we need to combat terrorism."
"I am honestly convinced of that."
"I naturally believe it is right and reasonable to try to curb and dry up the flow of funding to terrorists."
"That is an absolute must."
"There might be other ways to achieve that goal."
"The fact is, however, that instead of standing here I would probably be going up to receive the Nobel Prize if I knew exactly how to do it."
"Things being as they are, I believe we have at least a good starting point here."
"For all that, we have engaged in lengthy discussions."
"We have spoken about this report with many different institutions, including the European Central Bank."
