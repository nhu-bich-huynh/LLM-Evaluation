"We wish to make it once again a project of cooperation between independent countries of equal value which trust one another and to limit it to areas such as the internal market and cross-border environmental problems."
"The attempts to push the EU towards being a United States of Europe without popular support now threatens the survival of the integration project."
"However, it is not only the attempts by the political elite to push ahead with the creation of a supranational EU against the will of the people that undermines the legitimacy of the EU."
"It is generally apparent that the European peoples associate the EU with top-down government, bureaucracy and corruption."
"In this very debate in the House, it is, moreover, corruption and fraud with which we are dealing."
"I wish greatly to commend Mr Bösch for his report."
"It was painstakingly prepared and contains sound proposals that I support wholeheartedly."
"At the same time, our work in the Committee on Budgetary Control shows how difficult it is to get on top of fraud."
"There is some basic systemic error we are not getting at."
"Money disappears year in and year out via agricultural policy and regional policy."
"There is barely any clear sign of improvement."
"Those officials who reveal scandals in the EU bureaucracy are routinely frozen out, dismissed or given early retirement."
"EU history is littered with the corpses of all these whistleblowers."
"A number of scandals are revealed in other ways but, normally, there is never any legal process."
"This cannot be allowed to continue, and it is now Commissioner Kallas’s responsibility to ensure that this development does not continue into the future and undermine the little confidence in the EU that the EU’s population still has left."
"Mr President, I am also able to give my full support to Mr Bösch’s report, which is both constructive and perceptive."
"Mr Bösch pointed out that we still have too much fraud, and that is a view I can only endorse."
"I think there may be said to be two problems."
"The way Mr Bösch expressed this was to say that EU money has a different value in the Member States than the Member States’ own money."
"This is a problem that the former President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, addressed years ago. The way he put it was to say that we cannot continue to provide aid in this form."
"Instead, we must give countries cheap loans, as in that way they will have to pay the money back and be careful about what they use it for."
"The second problem is that EU legislation and administration is still not good enough."
"There are still too many cases in which the money goes into the wrong pockets or in which we do not get value for money."
"I was talking recently with a Danish expert who works for a private firm and for the EU in the former Yugoslavia, and he reported that the aid provided by the World Bank, the EBRD and the EIB is monitored quite differently. In contrast, the EU lets things slide."
"When the money is used, all is well."
"This is something we need to have looked into so that we are as proficient as the World Bank and the other big banks in ensuring that the money is used correctly."
"Mr President, in 1999 I was elected to this Parliament as a non-party frontrunner of the Austrian social democrats."
"At the time, I had an equally high opinion of both OLAF and our rapporteur, Mr Bösch."
"Since then, both the voters and I have had to learn that neither of them are that good."
"OLAF is the private army of the powers in Brussels."
"Someone denounced reporter Hans-Martin Tillack, claiming he had paid money for confidential documents from inside the Commission. used the documents to publish a report about fraud in Brussels."
"Every word of the article was true."
"That was not the point, however."
"Tillack still has not got the confiscated documents back."
"It is not unusual for journalists to work with confidential official information."
"Such information was also used in this report."
"Everyone who works on a newspaper knows that it is almost good form for people who are exposed to claim that money was paid for confidential documents."
"OLAF also asked the public prosecutors in Hamburg, where is published, for help; they refused."
"No judge was found who was prepared to do his duty."
"These EU investigators have been gradually expanding their powers for years now."
"No one can stand in OLAF chief Heinz-Hermann Brüner’s way."
"That is what European law now says, and the thoroughness with which Brussels always sorts everything out means that the Council has always immediately adjusted criminal law accordingly."
"Now even fewer people in Europe are safe from Franz-Hermann Brüner!"
"Uncovering Mr Bösch’s part in all this will have to wait for another time."
"I have quoted everything I have said today from today’s issue of the news magazine ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Kallas, I would first of all like to offer my most sincere thanks to Mr Busuttil for the excellent work he has carried out as shadow rapporteur."
"On the eve of our vote, I would like to speak about the way in which the work of OLAF has been judged within the Bösch report."
"I felt that it was my responsibility to defend this fledgling European anti-fraud office, which up to now has never received any criticism from any judicial body, whether European or national. It is an organisation that has been the subject, however, of ruthless campaigns of slander and destabilisation, through worrying indirect attacks, in which even certain elements of this House are not uninvolved."
"It is with great regret that I am forced to state that Mr Bösch’s report also appears to be inspired by unjust, exploitative and one-sided attitudes with regard to OLAF."
"I believe, in particular, that it was premature and inappropriate to include the reference to a special report by the European Ombudsman against OLAF, which can only have been published in its final form with remarkably perfect timing."
"In addition, this reference, which I consider to be unacceptable political meddling in a delicate ongoing investigation into suspected corruption, has been brought back to the attention of Parliament by means of an oral amendment, which would seek to ignore, however, two verdicts of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice in favour of OLAF, which are by far more authoritative."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us leave it to the judicial bodies to pronounce on the investigations, and let us all ensure that OLAF never becomes, as some would wish, the Trojan horse of political battles and one-sided interests."
"For my part, I will continue to fight and to ensure that OLAF is forever an effective and impartial instrument, acting in defence of the legality and the financial interests of the European Union."
"I am convinced that Parliament will also become the spokesperson for such a battle."
"The crisis that Europe is going through today in the eyes of the citizens calls on us all to behave with the utmost responsibility."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bösch, I should firstly like to congratulate you, as others have already done."
"Secondly, it is a pity that the Director of OLAF is not here today. I am sure this is for reasons beyond his control."
"I should nevertheless like to point out that, on the one hand, OLAF must pay very careful attention to this report and that, on the other, Parliament and our rapporteur must pay due respect to OLAF. Such respect is essential for a body of democratic control such as ours."
"I hope that OLAF has similar respect for its supervisory committee, given that under no circumstances must OLAF’s indispensable independence be confused with self-sufficiency, which would be extremely detrimental to the functioning of our institutions."
"Turning to you, Commissioner, I should like to reiterate what we stated in point 28 of our report, namely that we await a Commission report by 31 October 2005, explaining fully what stage has been reached as regards the scandal of adulterated butter. Despite the fact that it was clear six years ago to all of those involved in the investigation that action had to be taken, none of the actual perpetrators, nor their accomplices, were brought to justice, and their activities continued undisturbed."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, to declare to this House that you are ready to accede to our request by 31 October."
"Mr President, I would like to continue quoting from : ‘There is no one who can stand in Franz-Hermann Brüner’s way."
"As the Commission’s decision establishing OLAF puts it, his Office “shall exercise the powers of investigation ... in complete independence” and it may “neither seek nor take instructions from the Commission, any government or any other institution or body”’."
"That must sound like heaven to a German public prosecutor, who is bound by instructions from the Ministry of Justice."
"That is a tradition that is taken for granted in many European countries."
"This brings us to quite a big problem."
"No one who is for Europe can be in favour of OLAF as it is, no one who is for Europe can be in favour of the EU as it is, especially when it uses an instrument like OLAF, where the well-tried principles of the rule of law are disregarded on a massive scale, especially the right to be heard and the right to information, when such proceedings are under way."
"I urge Commissioner Kallas to do something about this."
". Thank you for your comments."
"Several speakers touched upon the subject of OLAF."
"As I said, and as you all know, in July we will have a broad discussion about the status of OLAF and the legal environment surrounding it."
"I hope we can settle some of the outstanding questions during the hearings."
"My desire, and that of the Commission, is to calm the turbulence surrounding OLAF, to develop a reliable, efficient organisation, where it is possible to follow a case from start to finish and deal with it in a reasonable timescale, following all necessary procedures and without intervening in matters of substance."
"We must create an institution that is a beacon of trust and which helps us to dispel the shadow of suspicion, which is everywhere in the European institutions, not only concerning OLAF, but all issues."
"I agree with Mr Bösch and other speakers that we have an extensive range of rules and programmes that may give rise to the possibility of fraud, but also offer great scope for mismanagement and weak control."
"No-one fully understands the origins of these programmes, rules and subsidies."
"Consequently, I ask Members of Parliament to support all the efforts we are now making to simplify the rules and proposals so as to make the financial system more transparent, simpler, visible and easier to follow and control."
"This is a major question."
"The Commission and Parliament have made proposals, but we need more concrete proposals."
"Sometimes, someone suggests that a regulation or subsidy should be abolished because of the damage it is causing."
"Then someone else will say that it is good enough, that we cannot change anything, that there are certain political purposes and reasons behind it, so we try instead to simplify it, with the result that little is finally achieved."
"I am happy to hear that there is a clear understanding about the responsibility of Member States in all these matters."
"We are preparing certain proposals to strengthen our single audit model as part of the integrated control framework."
"I hope that I can soon inform Members of Parliament of our proposals."
"So far the response to these proposals has been very positive in several Member States, but not in all."
"The sharing of responsibility between the Commission and Member States is crucial."
"Mr Mulder asked about the public prosecutor."
"The Commission has been very much in favour of the idea of a public prosecutor, but many Member States have not been very positive on this issue."
"The Commission did not include it in its working programme, because it saw clearly that it would meet fierce resistance from certain Member States."
"It was included in the ‘Hague programme’, which increases judicial cooperation between Member States."
"As far as I know, however, it is being withdrawn from that programme."
"We deeply regret this and will try to find other ways to increase cooperation between Member States."
"The issues raised by Mr Fazakas clearly show how the lack of a proper cooperation mechanism makes it difficult to achieve effective results."
"In reply to his question, of course we will provide a report up to October 2005."
"Yet this is an issue where we can clearly see that one Member State initially made intensive efforts, with very good cooperation with OLAF, and then the case was divided up among the Member States where these operations occurred."
"Judiciaries in the different Member States examined these issues in very different ways, giving priority to different aspects."
"Therefore, some kind of model for cooperation would be very useful."
"As Mr Lundgren pointed out, fighting fraud is a very systemic question."
"The Commission wishes to develop a systemic response to possible fiscal mismanagement."
"We can never avoid bad things, but the question, in a democratic society, is how we handle such cases and how we develop a systemic response capable of dealing with all possible nasty surprises."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Brepoels, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the Community (INSPIRE) (COM(2004)0516 – C6-0099/2004 – 2004/0175(COD)) (A6-0108/2005)."
". Mr President, first I should like to thank the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for their work on this subject at first reading."
"If we are to shape a good environmental policy, then we need to have good information."
"The directive being debated, therefore, will help considerably in improving this basic information infrastructure."
"Indeed, the shaping of policy is frequently hampered by the fact that information is often not available in a form which enables it to be used."
"Often the data simply do not exist or they exist but are inadequately substantiated or of unsatisfactory quality."
"At other times, the information is fragmentary and comes in a variety of different forms and types, making it impossible to use it in order to shape policy at European level."
"In other cases, the information is in the hands of government agencies which do not wish to publish it."
"European policy-makers either come up against refusal to allow them to access the relevant information or are forced to accept onerous and costly licensing arrangements in order to obtain access to the data."
"As a result, our environmental policy is not based on knowledge to the maximum possible and desired extent."
"INSPIRE will help to remove these barriers by forcing government agencies to improve documentation and ensure that their data systems are interoperable."
"Similarly, they will share data with each other and with the public."
"In this way, the infrastructure of knowledge will be improved not only for environmental policy, but also in other policy areas which use the same geographical data."
"Over the last six months, intensive discussions have been held between the three institutions in a bid to achieve agreement at the first reading of this subject."
"Unfortunately, however, this proved impossible, due to continuing concerns being put forward by certain Member States in connection with intellectual property rights."
"Nonetheless, I am particularly grateful for the persistence and attention with which Parliament, in other words the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, managed to reach an agreement with the Council."
"During these discussions, Parliament proved that it clearly understands the importance of removing the barriers to which I referred earlier, in order to improve the knowledge infrastructure for environmental policy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has already indicated, there is indeed a great need for information and for better management of existing information flows."
"This applies to the European Union in general – as we have noticed at the referenda on the Constitution – but also to all Community policy areas, in particular."
"Despite decades of common European environmental policy, there is still evidence of major barriers blocking access and the use of spatial information at Community level."
"There are already quite a few instruments in place, including the European Environmental Agency, and new instruments are being developed in a number of directives that are related to this."
"In order to eliminate those shortcomings now, the Commission has made a proposal to set up and run an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe, which has been abbreviated to ‘Inspire’."
"It will in the first instance be based on existing data infrastructures and existing information in the Member States."
"I can tell you, Commissioner, that we are right behind the proposal’s objectives and principles, because Inspire also seeks to give the public more insight into environmental policy and, in this respect, to increase the level of accountability at local and regional level."
"Inspire also seeks to promote the reuse, but above all the exchange and sharing, of data between governments, and, without doubt, to be a driving force behind the pooling of new relevant environmental information."
"Finally, it will certainly also be instrumental in making environmental policy more efficient and effective across borders."
"The proposal relates to information needed to supervise the state of the environment, but also to improve on it, and can therefore benefit all policy measures that have a direct or indirect impact on the environment."
"As you have already indicated, there has been an extensive debate in our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I can tell you that some Members see the proposal as not going far enough, while others believe that it went a little too far."
"We in this House thought we should make a number of constructive and useful amendments to this rather technical proposal in order to accommodate a number of justified concerns on the part of the current operators in the field, without, however, losing sight of the ultimate goal."
"I will mention a few of those amendments."
"Our focus of attention was, in the first place, the cost-benefit issue."
"You know that data suppliers are concerned about the income which they want to continue to generate so as to promote innovation and development."
"I think it is important for Inspire not to get drawn into this debate on compensation for those suppliers."
"This remains an issue that must be resolved at Member State level."
"Secondly, current European and international legislation concerning intellectual rights of ownership remains in place."
"It is prohibited to make reproductions, and data may not simply be sold on."
"Thirdly, we also built in a number of guarantees for what is referred to as free-viewing, thus avoiding improper use for commercial reasons."
"It must also be made perfectly clear that at a cost, the download and the processing services can be made available upon request."
"Finally, with a view to respecting the division of competence within the Member States, we also suggested a few changes, because we deem it important that the governments that collate this spatial information – those are, in many cases, the regional and local governments – are also involved in the coordination of the infrastructure and are also responsible for the contacts with the European Commission."
"I can tell you that in a very constructive consultation involving the shadow rapporteurs of all political groups, we managed to approve the report in our committee by unanimous vote."
"A number of compromise amendments were tabled to ensure that Parliament’s position is coherent and unambiguous."
"Finally, I should also like to thank the Commission for the support we received, not least during the informal talks with the Council, with the object of reaching agreement at first reading, which, unfortunately, we did not manage to achieve."
"Although this has represented a slight setback in terms of time, together, we have made huge strides forward."
"The informal talks with Coreper have already clarified and crystallised a number of ideas for the future."
"I therefore hope that tomorrow’s plenary will be approving this proposal with an equal dose of enthusiasm."
"It should enable us to take an important step in the direction of a more sustainable European environmental policy."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its proposal and the rapporteur for her constructive report, which has improved on this Commission proposal in a number of important respects."
"The basic objective of compiling interoperable spatial data on a European scale is to be welcomed."
"The environment in particular demonstrates to us every day that it knows no national boundaries and neither positive nor negative effects stop at the border post."
"The collection and use of data must be practicable, however."
"The rapporteur’s proposals have created clearer formulations and rules which greatly improve the proposal."
"Moreover, everyone in the Community will have access to the environmental data they want free of charge – a great step forward in bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"By requiring the data to be coherent, it also makes this a practical possibility."
"It must also be clear, however, that if the data is not merely to be consulted but is to be used commercially a fee must be payable; anything else would not be fair to the very people who will have to produce the data, in particular local and municipal authorities."
"If the Member States decide differently about such payments, however, the subsidiarity principle makes that perfectly possible."
"I also believe the rapporteur’s call for the proposal to be easy to understand and transparent is important."
"The comitology procedure called for by the Commission should therefore only be used in exceptional cases."
"The public has a right to know precisely how and where decisions have been taken and, above all, what the reasons for them were."
"In conclusion, I can say that the rapporteur has with her proposal succeeded in bringing the Commission proposal closer to the citizen and introducing into it greater transparency, subsidiarity and practicability."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, on their work and dedication in trying to improve this proposal for a Directive and on trying to reach a compromise — which has not been possible, but there has been an attempt — with the Council at first reading."
"I will begin by pointing out that there are still currently certain significant problems in the Member States with regard to access to spatial information and its use, due, amongst other things, to the fragmentation of data sets and sources, gaps in availability, lack of harmonisation between data sets at different geographical scales and duplication of information collection."
"I therefore do not have the least doubt about the usefulness of this new instrument, which is fundamental to the drawing up, application, monitoring and evaluation of environmental policies at all levels and of policies or activities that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment."
"We in my group are therefore pleased that the Member States can guarantee the interoperability between spatial information systems and, in this way, eliminate the obstacles that still exist."
"One important aspect, which I would like to refer to, is that of funding."
"In this regard, I would like to stress that, according to the calculations of the European Commission itself, the application of this Directive will cost EUR 5 million per Member State, which represents 1% of the total spending on spatial information, while its application is expected to bring environmental benefits worth more than EUR 30 million per Member State, although it will perhaps be necessary for the directive to clearly establish the legibility conditions within the framework of the existing Community financial instruments for the costs of the planned actions."
"Furthermore, I believe it is appropriate to base the Community infrastructure on the spatial information infrastructures established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the subsidiarity principle, but amongst those infrastructures, particularly when the Member States, such as mine, have several levels of public administration."
"Finally, I would like to thank both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Council for their understanding, so that this proposal can provide for an analysis of soil erosion, since we must not forget the current significance of the progressive loss of soil throughout the European Union, and I would also like to express my concern about the specific role that the European Environment Agency should play in terms of creating the infrastructure necessary for the correct application of our objectives, since I still have some doubts in this field."
"I would like to echo the congratulations expressed by this House, particularly to the rapporteur, and I believe that this mechanism that we are going to approve tomorrow will undoubtedly provide more clarity within the European Union's mechanisms."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Brepoels for the work she has carried out, which we carried out together."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the report, insofar as it represents a very significant coordination effort between the Member States."
"The Council’s short-sighted attitude is regrettable, however, because, on the one hand, it has confined itself to environmental applicationsand, on the other hand, it has made little use of the Commission’s coordination capacities."
"The Commission can carry out a far more important role."
"Such a short-sighted attitude will require these topics to be re-examined in future, when it will be necessary precisely to make the document more general and to include possible areas for implementation – which will soon be extended by the availability of satellite systems, in particular GALILEO. These possible areas include, for instance, air, land and sea navigation assistance, support for land use and monitoring, which is yet to be taken to its logical conclusions, and the collection of statistical data with georeferenced points of reference, which could provide suggestions for further correlations."
"In our legislative capacity, however, we must also consider the need to draw up fewer documents, of a more general nature."
"I hope, therefore, that we can return to this topic, precisely in order to make it an extremely important instrument, since we need it for much more than the environment."
". Mr President, my many thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, for her excellent levels of cooperation with the political groups."
"The Council of Ministers wanted to impose too many restrictions on the public’s access to information."
"We support the rapporteur in her conclusion that we did not agree to this and that, accordingly, the compromise at first reading was not reached."
"It is reasonable to establish a database where existing environmental data can be made greater and more varied use of."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to emphasise that our citizens must have the right freely to access information that is relevant to their lives and health on, for example, environmental pollution, even if many polluters of the environment, for example, would not like it."
"Moreover, even if it is important for many authorities to collect revenue for the information it produces when it is being used for commercial purposes, it is important that our citizens can freely access the information they need for the sake of their own lives and health without having to pay for it."
". Mr President, this directive should be named Expire rather than Inspire, considering the detrimental effect it will have on the Ordnance Survey mapping agency of Great Britain."
"Ordnance Survey has been in existence for 215 years and has a long and distinguished record."
"Over the last 20 years or so, it has built itself up from a government-funded organisation into a successful commercial enterprise."
"Under its current arrangements, it has responsibility for its own finances and freedom to develop new customer-related initiatives."
"Inspire puts all that at risk and will undermine its successful commercial operation."
"Why is this being done?"
"Once more we see the dead hand of EU harmonisation and the EU’s need to control every aspect of its Member States’ lives."
"Also evident in this directive is the sinister presence of Galileo, the EU’s ‘big brother’ spy satellite, its eye in the sky."
"How much more effective that will be when the EU has control of national mapping services."
"According to the Commission’s own report, those involved in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, particularly the Commission itself, will be the main beneficiaries of this proposal."
"The British Government should have told the EU to get lost."
"However, we can always rely on its cowardice and craven surrender to the EU."
"I would ask you to vote against this directive, but knowing your insatiable appetite for more and more legislation, I know I am wasting my breath."
"Perhaps the growing torrent of damaging legislation imposed on the United Kingdom might help to bring the British Government and its people to their senses and bring forward the day of Britain’s unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"– Mr President, the success of the Community’s environmental policy depends very much on the availability of reliable scientific data and the trouble-free transmission of that data."
"The availability of spatial data is a necessary precondition for scientific evaluation conducted on the basis of environmental legislation."
"The standardisation of spatial data collected from the Member States has still not made any great progress, as there are still serious barriers at Community level that are hampering the exploitation of the available information."
"We must therefore try to improve the way spatial data is used and accessed, to facilitate the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies."
"The purpose is to provide a knowledge base to take decisions on policies relating to the environment and in this way promote sustainable development."
"That is the goal."
"The Community has various instruments at its disposal to help improve access to reliable data, in particular public sector data, in the first place, and later standardise it to make it comparable at Community level."
"One of them is the directive on public access to environmental information, for which I myself was rapporteur."
"The problems observed when it was being discussed should now be taken into careful consideration as we debate this proposal for a directive which would create a legal framework for the establishment of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe."
"One problem with both these directives is that it is feared that losses of income for certain data providers will result."
"I would therefore advise that we tread carefully right now, to avoid surprises."
"The most important objective is to reduce obstacles that hamper the shared use of data, particularly environmental data, among public authorities."
"The Community’s spatial data infrastructure will supplement the directives on the re-use of public sector information and public access to environmental information."
"I myself think it is very important that in establishing a spatial data infrastructure we should focus specifically on environmental policy, in which case there would be practical grounds for the centralisation of information."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive on INSPIRE lays down rules for the establishment of a spatial information infrastructure for the purposes of implementing Community environmental policies in the Member States."
"Its primary focus is intended to be collections of spatial data and associated services, network technologies for sharing, access, use, coordination and monitoring mechanisms and procedures."
"The principles and goals underlying these tasks, or in other words classification, standardisation and the establishment of an EU-wide database, would merit closer consideration if it were not for the fact that many European countries are currently experiencing political and economic problems as a result of rising unemployment and slow economic growth."
"There is a never-ending stream of proposals for new directives, even though it is the poorest among us who have to bear the brunt of their costs."
"Annual investments of as much as EUR 5 million per Member State could be necessary to implement INSPIRE, and yet the database will not be fully functional for another 10 years."
"It is worth emphasising at this point that attempts to create an information infrastructure must not run counter to the social policies of the individual Member States."
"The lofty goals proclaimed by the authors of the directive will be used as a pretext for the establishment of a database."
"Although such a database could well serve a variety of purposes, it could also be used as a political football, and this would pose a major risk."
"We therefore feel that this is not the most pressing of the many problems the EU needs to resolve."
"What is more, the directive requires further work and the incorporation of a great many safeguards."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Salinas García for underlining the fact that the benefits of Inspire will by far outweigh the cost."
"Regarding Mrs Brepoels’ comments on intellectual property rights, I would like to stress that these are not significantly compromised by the proposed directive."
"In particular, it does not in any way affect the principle of co-existence or ownership of intellectual property rights."
"Intellectual property rights held by public authorities must be exercised in a way that is compatible with the aim of Inspire, which is to ensure a maximum of data selling between public authorities, as well as public access to the data."
"Nevertheless, to answer some of Mr Batten’s concerns, the proposed directive explicitly allows public authorities to charge for data to be downloaded by the public."
"Mr Seeber is right in his comments on comitology."
"This is indeed a technical directive and many of the detailed rules, for example on how to ensure interoperability between data systems, can only be decided at expert level."
"I agree with Mrs Korhola."
"I would like to stress that the Inspire proposal builds on the access to information directive, incorporating the same type of restrictions on public access to information, and is fully complementary with the Aarhus Convention."
"Generally, I am very pleased to say that I can accept a large majority of the amendments proposed, at least in principle."
"A few of the amendments aim to clarify the obligations on public authorities in relation to public access and data selling and to provide safeguards for data providers in relation to intellectual property rights."
"Amendments 3 and 26 can be accepted in their entirety, while Amendments 28 and 29 can be accepted in principle."
"Most of the other amendments seek to provide technical clarification of the proposal."
"Some of these – Amendments 8 to 12 – are intended to make the structure of the text clearer and can also be accepted, although Amendment 9 introduces further small changes which can be only partly accepted."
"Some amendments introduce other clarifications and can be accepted, while a number of others require some rewording or further clarification, so can only be accepted in principle."
"There are just six amendments that we cannot accept."
"Amendments 2 and 7 seek to extend the scope of the directive to include data held by Community institutions and bodies."
"While we have no problem with this in substance, it would create substantial obligations on Community institutions and bodies and this cannot be done in the context of a directive."
"Amendment 30 deletes a reference to measures taken to prevent distortion of competition and would make the text unclear."
"Amendments 52, 53 and 54 give Member States more time to implement certain provisions of the directive."
"Delaying the implementation of key provisions will, however, also delay the benefits that will result from their implementation, an option which is not favoured by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on reinsurance and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC and 92/49/EEC and Directives 98/78/EC e 2002/83/EC (COM(2004)0273 C6-0038/2004 2004/0097(COD)) (A6-0146/2005)."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Skinner, the rapporteur, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work on this important subject."
"Although it is not very well known to the public, the reinsurance sector is very important for the financial and insurance markets in the European Union and internationally."
"The terrible events of 9/11, as well as more recent natural disasters, have shown how essential properly functioning insurance and reinsurance sectors are."
"The European Union is the world’s largest provider of reinsurance services."
"Supervision of reinsurance is important for financial stability, as well as for the standing of European Union reinsurers internationally."
"Whilst reinsurers were subject to national supervision rules, the reinsurance sector was one of the few financial fields without any major European prudential legislation."
"The proposal for a reinsurance directive has been prepared in close cooperation with Member States and the insurance industry."
"It is also in line with current reinsurance work in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors."
"This proposal provides a regulatory framework for insurance activities in the Community."
"It lays down a supervisory regime founded on the principles of single authorisation and prudential supervision by the home Member State."
"It is, in fact, the same regulatory framework already used for the completion of the single market in insurance and other financial services."
"The single authorisation will allow reinsurance undertakings to work throughout the Community under the freedom of establishment and free provision of services."
"The proposal could also be a useful preparation for reinsurance undertakings for the introduction of Solvency II, relating to the revision of current supervisory rules for direct insurance undertakings, in a few years’ time."
"This is currently being analysed by the Commission, Member States and stakeholders."
"By adopting this proposal, the European Union will be also the first international organisation with a regulatory framework for insurance."
"This will be an important precedent for other international fora, which are also working on the supervision of reinsurance."
"Finally, the proposal will also constitute a useful tool that will help give the European Union reinsurance industry effective market access to third countries."
"I look forward to hearing your comments."
". Mr President, I am pleased to be able to report to you on this directive."
"It has been a great honour to be involved in this."
"We need to thank many of the people working inside and outside this institution: people such as John-Paul Dryden, who fell ill during the report drafting stage and therefore could not help us to finish it."
"However, Manica Hauptman, who took it over, has devoted a great deal of time and attention to addressing the very deep concerns and the details."
"The Commission and its staff also played a vital role."
"I am sure Mr McCreevy is be aware how good his staff can be."
"Without the help of MEPs and their staff, and I note with appreciation the support from my colleagues across the floor, we could not have reached a fast-track agreement at first reading."
"We went to fight an election, came back after a time and found this still on our plates and it is quite remarkable that we have managed to deal with it so quickly."
"The concerns expressed by the House have been eliminated largely because of the agreement and the good work that has gone into it."
"The first question is, what is reinsurance?"
"It is about business-to-business, risk and the spread of that risk by the insurance industry."
"It covers such things as aircraft, ships and buildings."
"9/11 and its effects on the World Trade Center were insured by large reinsurance companies such as Lloyds and others for the kinds of catastrophes that we had hoped would not occur."
"They panicked, but managed to pay their debts."
"This is a business-to-business directive as well. It involves competition."
"The central political issue was whether competition was fair at European level and beyond."
"It was therefore a question of collateral."
"Since the value of the reassured risk was collected in banks in the country where the risk was to be covered, it just collected money that did nothing: dead cash, if you like."
"It was neither effective nor economic."
"It was an old blunt instrument. It had to be got rid of, because it increased administrative costs and it raised the issue of whether or not the risk was properly covered."
"That question then led us to another: the timing of this directive."
"We worked on a formula that allowed us to consider avoiding the Solvency II discussions, which would come later."
"The formula would be a form of compromise, with 24 months’ transposition and 12 months’ transition, which I welcomed, through the Luxembourg presidency’s efforts, and agreed to very easily."
"Parliament was able to vote on this in committee."
"Other issues included SPVs, the insolvency issue and captives."
"Without going into detail on those, I can say that we now have a level playing field at European level."
"The reinsurance market now has no barriers to trade and it will have a strong supervisory framework across Member States when this directive goes through."
"Thus it will help EU reinsurance undertakings to maintain their competitive edge around the world."
"It is a global market and European companies are at the very forefront."
"In fact, Europe is the second largest market in itself, after the US."
"Europe needs to play a role in the rest of the world."
"The adoption of this text is going to strengthen the hand of the European Union in arguing for an end to the unfair, anti-competitive scam in the United States of requiring non-US companies to pay collateral within the United States, where they are regulated state by state."
"Do not tell me that the US is a competitive economy: in terms of reinsurance, it is not."
"So the US now has to reconsider and I know it is doing so."
"This directive enables us to speak with one voice."
"Supervisors and regulators can impose higher standards of supervision on third country companies from outside the EU if they wish, rather like the Americans."
"There is a possibility of conflict in the world’s rule-making bodies on anti-competitive measures, which we know the US would strongly resist."
"But there is room for compromise, efficiency and a voluntary initiative."
"Let us look at some of the figures."
"Collateral is required by non-US companies in the United States."
"It is counted in billions: it is reckoned that USD 40 billion is collected in the US against European companies."
"There are far more, at a cost of USD 500 million every year."
"This does not promote efficiency and it does not provide security against risk."
"The first blow has been struck with an EU market."
"With the Commission’s support, the fight will go on."
"We should congratulate ourselves on this European law, which has brought about significant change both inside and outside Europe."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good day for the European Union, for policyholders, and for insurance undertakings as well, because today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote – which I assume will be unanimous – will dismantle the much-criticised bureaucratic obstacles and make European reinsurance more competitive on international markets."
"Supervision of direct insurers is regulated across Europe in a number of directives: the European Union has already enacted extensive and necessary instruments for the protection of policyholders with the loss insurance and life assurance directives and the solvency rules for insurance companies."
"These will now be complemented by the harmonised supervision of reinsurance."
"The directive on which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs reports is therefore an important addition to supervision in this important service industry."
"The reinsurance directive, which is now successfully on its way after more than three years’ preparatory work, draws to a large extent on the systems of supervision that are already in place for direct insurance."
"As has already been pointed out, important differences between direct and reinsurance were also identified in close cooperation with the Council, the competent authorities of the Member States and reinsurance industry representatives and are taken into account in the draft directive."
"It includes in particular a uniform treatment of life and non-life reinsurance so far as solvency margins are concerned, an arrangement based on the prudent person approach for capital investments and a clear time limit of 36 months from the entry into force of the directive for the collaterals the supervisory authorities still require in the individual Member States."
"As has also already been mentioned, the harmonisation and liberalisation the directive seeks to introduce will further strengthen the competitive position of European reinsurance and Europe as a whole as a financial centre."
"At the same time, the administrative hurdles within the Community will be dismantled."
"When the directive is implemented, the tortuous national licensing systems within the EU will disappear."
"The home country’s supervisory authority will provide such supervision as is necessary."
"A reinsurer’s authorisation will then apply for the whole of the European Union."
"Next year or the year after will probably see an extensive rewriting of the rules for the whole insurance industry as a result either of motions to that effect or ‘Solvency 2’."
"An amendment that I originally moved has ensured that this reinsurance directive does not anticipate the political debate on ‘Solvency 2’."
"I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his close cooperation; we all hope that the next time such an important resource is debated there will be more time in the committees and longer to prepare."
". – Mr President, I would like to thank Peter Skinner for the work he has done, especially as the person responsible for Solvency I. The logical consequence is of course that I am pleased we now have this report."
"Reinsurance undertakings are among the last in the financial services sector not to have a European passport."
"The planned directive will ensure that reinsurance undertakings operate under the same competitive conditions throughout the EU while at the same time not preventing direct insurance undertakings from assuming reinsurance risks."
"The European passport means that an EU-domiciled reinsurer, that is a reinsurance undertaking that is authorised and supervised in its home country but which covers risks of an insurance undertaking in the host country, will no longer be subject to the discretionary authorisation of the host country’s supervisory authority."
"If this system of mutual recognition is to operate without damage to direct insurers in a host country and under the same conditions of competition throughout the EU, the transposition of the directive into national law must be harmonised in a similar way as with banks, and national supervisors must cooperate as regards their methods of supervision."
"In one of the amendments I have tabled, I therefore called on them to cooperate more closely in the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee."
"The reinsurance industry is a global network because that is the only way to obtain a sufficient spread of the risk of major losses and disasters."
"European reinsurance undertakings have to compete in particular with North American and Australian rivals."
"The recent American International Group scandal in the US has exposed the extensive control and disclosure shortcomings in relations between direct insurers and reinsurers."
"In one of my amendments I therefore called on the Commission and national insurance supervisors to cooperate more closely with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to get standards of corporate governance and internal controlling procedures extended."
"In order to reach a consensus with the Council as quickly as possible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was the lead committee, accepted only one subparagraph amending the resolutions in the competent Council working party."
"All the proposed amendments were sacrificed to the accelerated procedure."
"That alone explains why the version laid before plenary does not include my amendment clarifying what government bonds can count towards the cover for a reinsurance undertaking’s technical reserves."
"In consequence, the reinsurance directive is the only financial services directive that makes no distinction between the risk weightings of any government bonds and does not differentiate on the basis of the state’s rating or of whether or not the bond issuer is an EU or OECD Member State."
"A little more would have achieved a great deal."
". Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his skill and inclusiveness, which, in cooperation with the Council and Commission, have enabled a speedy agreement to be reached on this matter."
"The text is a compromise, but it has been accepted by all parties, including the reinsurance industry."
"This is not a sexy dossier."
"You probably would not talk about it much in a referendum on the Constitution – if you had one – but it is vitally important."
"The lack of an EU regulatory framework for reinsurance and differing national rules have created uncertainty for companies, barriers to trade within the internal market, greater administrative burdens and costs, and a weakening of the EU’s position in international trade negotiations."
"As someone who represents London, with its strong insurance sector, and in particular as someone who worked for several years for Lloyd’s of London, I appreciate what a significant single market achievement this is, based on the recognised principles of licensing home state control and mutual recognition."
"The important thing for us citizens is that, the more supervision is streamlined and cost-reduced, the more jobs are created in a European industry which is competitive at home and abroad."
"It will release assets for investment that are currently tied up unproductively in collateral."
"It will enable the EU to mount a challenge to American anti-competitive rules."
"Reinsurance is a global business and EU firms are in the lead, so a global marketplace in which firms have access to markets on an equal basis is needed."
"This directive takes us firmly in the right direction."
"Not sexy, but significant."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are well aware of how important reinsurance is for the insurance and banking sectors."
"It is enormously important for all companies, regardless of how large they are."
"Several issues arise as a result of this, but in view of the time available to me I should like to touch upon just two."
"The first is the question of whether it is appropriate for us to limit the scope of the directive’s rules to reinsurance undertakings."
"After all, we know full well that insurance undertakings take out mutual insurance policies in order to reduce risks, as do banks when issuing bank guarantees."
"The second point I should like to address is the need for obligatory reinsurance of natural disaster insurance policies, of which there are 14 different types."
"As the name suggests, natural disasters are unpredictable and hence carry a very high risk, although it is sometimes the case that such disasters do not occur for many years."
"This risk is borne by both the large insurance undertakings and the numerous smaller ones."
"It is particularly high in the field of agriculture, as the large quantity of farms means that a huge number of insurance policies are taken out."
"Finally, I should like to say that even though I believe that any form of regulation would improve matters, many of the issues I would have liked to have seen covered in this proposal for a directive are unfortunately missing from it."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to Mr Skinner and other MEPs for being unavoidably delayed due to traffic congestion and a Competitiveness Council meeting in Luxembourg."
"However, I was here for the speeches."
"I am very pleased to inform you that the Commission can fully accept all the amendments in the report adopted by the committee."
"The amendments take account of the discussions in the Council and are also strongly supported by the insurance industry."
"The solutions proposed are, furthermore, well balanced and respect the Commission’s initial intentions with this legislation."
"Mr Skinner also raised the issue of collateralisation."
"Collateralisation is highly costly for reinsurance companies, as it restricts the investment strategy."
"This ultimately leads to more expensive reinsurance services, which could increase insurance premiums for policyholders."
"The EU insurance industry would particularly like to see the American collateralisation system abolished or amended."
"I have had discussions recently with my United States counterparts with a view to eliminating or reducing the US collateralisation requirement and those discussions are ongoing."
"I congratulate the committee and the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for their excellent work and thank all those who helped to ensure that the work was done speedily and effectively."
". Mr President, I wonder whether the Commissioner is aware that there is a possible draft model law for states in the United States, which has been drafted for the legislators."
"What I would be very willing to do, if you have not seen it, is to pass it on to you."
"I think at the moment they surely are at their weakest position. It is something that comes from the strength of this report and it is worth pressing this point with the Commissioner, to make sure that we have full agreement across the floor so that a Commissioner and Parliament will be pressing most strongly to push the Americans further into the corner and see whether or not we can get the agreement from them that we really deserve."
". Mr President, I am having difficulties in that regard, although I have had discussions with people in the insurance industry."
"On my recent trip to the United States I raised the issue with some of the insurance commissioners."
"As the honourable Member will well know, one – though not the only –difficulty with this issue is that in the United States each state has responsibility for that particular area."
"At least in the Member States of the European Union you can go to one regulatory supervisor in the Member State, you can go to the European Union for this particular directive; but in the United States each state has responsibility in this area and each state appoints its own insurance commissioners."
"It was believed that great strides had been made in recent years and the insurance industry on this side of the Atlantic had been working very hard and thought they had reached an understanding of how things would move forward."
"But then it all broke down, because the insurance commissioners change on a pretty regular basis in the United States."
"So one can appreciate the difficulties."
"During my recent trip to the United States in April, I raised this matter and now the talks are ongoing again."
"But I would like to underline the difficulties, which are mostly related to the issue to which I have just referred."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0145/2005) by Mrs Schierhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (COM(2004)0490) – C6-0181/2004 – 2004/0161(CNS))."
". Mr President, at the outset let me apologise for my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel."
"She has been delayed, but will be here before the end of the debate."
"I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Schierhuber and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all their work on this report."
"The committee adopted the report with 129 amendments."
"I shall comment only on some of the major points."
"Some amendments reduced the minimum percentages of funding for the three axes, maintained the proposed funding for LEADER and eliminated the reserve for this approach."
"This should give more flexibility to the programming priorities of the Member States."
"I understand this need and I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament agrees on the need for minimum percentages."
"This is crucial if we want to ensure balanced programmes that address the wide variety of challenges in rural areas."
"The Commission is prepared to accept the reduction of the minimum percentages."
"However, I consider that the reduction for Axis 3 – quality of life and diversification of the rural economy – from 15 to 8% is too large, and would affect negatively the necessary balance between the axes, i.e. Amendments 17, 43, 44, 115, 117 and 118."
"Please do not forget that measures under Axis 3, if used correctly, could contribute significantly to promoting economic growth and job creation in rural areas."
"This is clearly in the interests of our farmers and their families and is closely linked to what we want to achieve under the Lisbon Strategy."
"Other amendments bring together the strategic and operational planning and reduce reporting procedures to two reports for the whole financial period – Amendments 34 to 41."
"I am sceptical on the first point, since the strategy would precede the operational planning."
"However, I am prepared to compromise on a reduced frequency of the strategic monitoring, biannual instead of annual."
"I would stress that robust reporting is essential for accountability and for explaining to Europe's citizens the contribution of our policy to agriculture and rural areas."
"I can in principle accept the main amendments to Axis 1 – Amendments 54, 63, 65 (in part), 66 and 67."
"They concern the extension of support for young farmers to subsidised loans, the requirement that forest management plans be a function of the size of the holding, the extension of support to minimum- sized enterprises for the processing and marketing of agricultural products (in the forestry sector, however, the support will remain limited to micro-enterprises), the inclusion of reparcelling among eligible support for infrastructures, focussing predominantly on operations aimed at improving competitiveness, support for the cooperation between actors in the food chain and for the transfer of knowledge."
"I come now to Axis 2, which concerns Amendments 73, 79 and parts of 69, 76 and 81."
"The Commission is in principle prepared to accept or partially accept amendments on: the inclusion of the conservation of genetic diversity, the inclusion of payments linked to the Water Framework Directive, not to consider the requirements for pesticide and fertiliser use as additional to mandatory requirements but as part of them, a more flexible approach towards the duration of agri-environmental commitments, the eligibility of high nature value areas among non-productive investments, and the inclusion of loss of income criteria for Natura 2000 payments in forestry."
"Finally, some of the proposed amendments are difficult to accept for various reasons."
"A number of them go beyond the scope of the Commission's proposal and existing norms, thus risking diluting their policy effects."
"Others make unnecessary specifications which are already included in more general concepts."
"In conclusion, I can accept or partially accept some of the fundamental amendments proposed in your report."
"The other amendments I cannot accept."
"I wish to thank the Members of the European Parliament again for their positive and constructive contribution to European rural policy."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking in return the Commission, all the members of the Committee, all the Groups, and especially the Council, the secretariats, all their staff and all those who helped them do the groundwork, for working together so well."
"It was good to produce this report together."
"Over half the population of the European Union lives in rural areas, which account for around 90% of its territory."
"We all want to make the regions with their towns and villages active and attractive and to keep them that way and give rural areas a bright future – I am very pleased to see you have now arrived, Commissioner – and a flourishing and above all productive agriculture and forestry is the most important prerequisite for this."
"The 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy introduced lasting changes in European agriculture and forestry."
"Rural development has assumed even greater importance as this reform has progressed."
"This report contains the 2007–2013 programming period for rural development."
"I was particularly concerned to keep to the timetable for the vote here in plenary so that the Council and Commission can have a dossier available before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Farmers need the security to plan ahead."
"This is the first major programming for agriculture in the EU of 25."
"Rural development is important for all Member States, but for the new States in particular."
"It is particularly important in relation to the Financial Perspective for the period commencing 2007."
"May I remind you that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tabled a total of 342 amendments, the Committee on Regional Development 75 and the Committee on Budgets one, so it is something of an achievement that we now have only 130 of them."
"The fact is that we need this sort of interdisciplinary cooperation and we need willingness to cooperate in rural areas."
"There is much that is positive about the Commission proposal: the combination of financial instruments into a single fund, simplification for greater ease of understanding and much more besides."
"Also the three axes structure and the Leader approach."
"We reached three major compromises in our deliberations in the Committee on Agriculture. The first is the weighting of the axes, the second is Leader and the third is cofinancing as proposed by the Commission."
"We concluded that in order to preserve subsidiarity it is important to reduce the appropriations for the axes, that is 10, 20 and 8."
"For Leader we see a minimum appropriation of 7%, but we want the Leader reserve deleted."
"It is also important that Parliament will be sending the Council and Commission an important political signal if a majority in this House adopts this."
"I was always concerned that this report should cover both northern and southern regions, both eastern and western."
"This report also clearly acknowledges that the CAP reform’s modulation releases money that should be used primarily for Axes 1 and 2."
"I know that the Commissioner agrees with me on the need for support for young farmers."
"Our future generations are at stake and I hope that you, Commissioner, will be able to agree to Parliament’s estimate of EUR 55 000 per farm."
"It is the need for greater competitiveness that prompts us to extend it to small and medium-sized farms and, in forestry, to small and very small enterprises, not to mention, Commissioner, to the less-favoured areas, where we want a study to get a suitable redefinition of less-favoured areas and also to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"There is a lot more besides."
"We also want more money, because we support Natura 2000, but that will only work with more resources in rural development."
"The Rural Development Programme cannot replace the other programmes, structural funds and the like; we must all be there for the rural areas together."
"A productive agriculture and forestry is essential for an active and attractive rural area."
"A policy for rural areas is a policy for the entire population in all of Europe’s regions and is the way to ensure they will survive."
"Finally, three amendments were tabled for plenary."
"I can accept Amendments 130 and 131, but unfortunately not 132."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rural development policy is the most innovative element of the Community’s new agricultural policy, and it is crucial that the EU budget does not sacrifice this most ambitious of challenges for the future of our rural areas."
"Cutting the funds allocated to rural development means taking away resources from food safety, environmental protection, measures to enhance the countryside, product quality and job creation."
"The report endorsed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development attaches great importance to support measures for young farmers, who should be encouraged to remain in the countryside and to farm in a competitive and sustainable manner."
"Mrs Schierhuber’s efforts to maintain funding for rural development are commendable, but reducing the minimum percentages of expenditure on three axes causes misgivings."
"It would have been more appropriate to keep the Commission’s proposal; lowering the rates means allowing Member States more discretion in their management of resources, and consequently a weaker and less incisive EU policy."
"In addition, with regard to the LEADER programme, the Commission’s proposal establishing a reserve fund for countries with lower spending levels, in order to enhance and reward the best projects, should be kept."
"It is crucial, moreover, that the national action plans should be consistent with the Community’s strategic objectives, and the strengthening of partnerships is an essential tool in fulfilling these objectives."
"Finally, in order to transform rural development into a genuine territorial policy, the policy must be consistent with, and integrated with, all of the other Community policies."
"It involves fundamental elements of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, which we cannot abandon if we hope to revive Europe, its objectives and its values."
". Mr President, as has already been said, the Commission's proposal establishes three main priorities: increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors, improving the environment and land management, and improving quality of life and promoting agricultural diversification."
"I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, on the wonderful work she has done, not only because of the document we are going to vote on during tomorrow's sitting, but also because she has been able to produce a balanced text which fully incorporates the compromises reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Furthermore, it makes very significant improvements to the Commission's text that will help to provide more flexibility and make the management of programmes more effective and efficient."
"Amongst other improvements, I would like to refer to the reduction of minimum spending percentages for each axis — which I believe to be positive — the possibility of combining national and/or regional programmes, increasing equality between men and women and the appeal to the Member States to facilitate access by women to joint ownership of farms."
"With regard specifically to each axis, I would highlight the increase in assistance for the installation of young farmers, which Mrs Schierhuber has just referred to: the EUR 55 000 granted in the form of a premium or an interest subsidy of loan and the flexibility to help them to comply with the rules."
"I would also stress the extension of assistance to medium-sized companies for marketing and processing, as well as any form of producers association."
"In this regard, I believe that it is they, at the end of the day, who are in the best position to provide added value for local products."
"I would like to refer to an issue that is of crucial importance: the recovery of the depopulation criterion in the least-favoured areas which, whichever new definition the Commission provides for these regions in the future, must be treated as a priority, because the abandonment of rural areas by their populations is an undeniable sign of their backwardness."
"With regard to the funding of NATURA 2000, which Mrs Schierhuber has also referred to, the report calls for an increase in the resources allocated, since the Commission has on several occasions rejected our proposal to provide NATURA 2000 with its own financial instrument."
"I would finally like to refer, in axis 3, to the support for the activities of women in rural areas."
"I believe that this is a fundamental element to which we must dedicate all of our efforts and that we must provide many guarantees in order to ensure that women are fully incorporated."
"I also wished to refer to the rural development measures, to the LEADER approach as a whole, which is going to be enhanced by this Regulation, because it helps to make the European Union visible to the citizens and at this point in time visibility is something that we must not diminish."
"The thing that surprised me in particular about the French ‘no’ was the fact that 70% of French farmers had voted against the draft European Constitution."
"We have the obligation to correct the situation and I believe that this report makes a good contribution in this regard."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Schierhuber has produced an excellent report on the EU’s new regulation relating to the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development."
"I also wish to express my sincerest thanks for the constructive cooperation shown by the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development."
"The main focus of the EU’s agricultural policy is moving in the direction of rural development, as direct subsidies and market measures have been strictly confined to the framework of the Brussels compromise, as it is known."
"The intention is to cut direct aid and market measures by around 5% every year, which is an annual saving of EUR 1.5 billion as far as the EAFRD is concerned."
"In all, more than 11 billion a year has been set aside for rural development in the EU’s future financial frameworks."
"The need, however, is a desperate one."
"The Commission proposed that measures should be targeted at three policies: the improved competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, land management, or enhancement of the countryside and the environment, and the diversification of the rural economy and enhancement of the quality of life in rural areas."
"The Commission proposed that a certain minimum amount of financing should be allocated to each policy."
"The committee reduced these threshold amounts to the lowest value possible, because Member States have to be guaranteed sufficient flexibility in order to draw up their own individual programmes."
"The central task of the EAFRD is to improve preconditions for agricultural competitiveness in different parts of the EU."
"For this reason, the development of the Least Favoured Areas scheme, for example, is more relevant than ever, as aid under the common agricultural policy mainly focuses on the EU’s best farming regions."
"In the same way, the importance of environmental aid for agriculture is growing, as environmental issues become more and more relevant to the present time."
"The purpose of the EAFRD is to improve the opportunities that rural life can offer."
"That is why my group believes that aid measures should be targeted specifically at private individuals and the organisations they establish, not the state."
"Furthermore, financial support for business should focus specifically on micro and small enterprises."
"With these comments, we give our heartfelt support to the adoption of Mrs Schierhuber’s report."
". – Mr President, in the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, which have had terrible consequences for family farming and for small and medium-sized holdings, one of the most recent and most worrying developments of which is the untying of production aid, the Commission has repeatedly overlooked the importance of agriculture in ensuring a settled population and economic and social cohesion in rural regions. It has also paid no attention and offered no support to the so-called cohesion countries, in which people are deserting the countryside in increasing numbers."
"The budget proposal tabled by the Commission for the new Rural Development Fund within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is woefully inadequate, for example in the way it takes substantial amounts from this fund to finance the Natura 2000 network."
"It is particularly important to Portuguese farming and farmers that the budget for Axis 1 and for agricultural and forestry production, covering uncultivated land and their representative organisations, be increased."
"Community funding for Natura 2000 must be based on the corresponding much-needed increase in financing within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013, as part of the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds, which ought to be the main sources of financing, or as part of the LIFE+ programme."
"In other words, the most appropriate solution would be to set up a specific Community fund in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for Natura 2000, thereby promoting the protection of biodiversity, as we did in the proposal that we tabled in the Committee on Agriculture."
"We object to the Commission’s plan to lay the groundwork for entities that have nothing to do with the rural world to be able to receive support that ought to be earmarked for farming, production and the rural world – in other words, for agricultural and forestry production and for farming as a whole – encompassing a huge and complex range of entities that can apply for funds within the framework of rural development."
"We should like to stress once again that genuine streamlining and limiting of the maximum payment per farmer in the common agricultural policy will help not only to redistribute the aid more fairly among the Member States, farmers and farms, but also to increase support to the market for small and medium sized farmers and the amounts available for rural development, in particular for compensation payments and support for organic farming."
". Mr President, in rural Ireland, family farming is the basis of community life."
"Through successive anti-farming policies, we are seeing a dismantling of Irish family farming and, as a result, of our rural communities."
"Everyone wants rural development, but in the context of beleaguered Irish farming, the only rural development I welcome is one that supports family farming, while enriching rural communities with complementary social, educational, transport and employment projects and infrastructure."
"But, looking at this rural development plan, which seeks to promote the complementary activities, while reducing and taking money from the primary activity – family farming – I can only say the plan is crazy, and in the Irish context, will destroy the very rural communities it purports to enrich."
"Instead, let us return to a bit of sanity, where we understand the value of farming, where farmers farm and are rewarded for their labours by a fair price for their produce."
"Farming is one of the oldest, most basic and most essential activities."
"In Ireland we seem to think that all the so-called ‘better jobs’ are the future and unwisely we starve out family farming."
"We are mad."
"We need both."
"Let us have the high-tech jobs, let us even bring the software development company to the rural area, but let us have cows, sugar beet, and furrows of maize and orchards of apples in the fields around it."
"Then we will have a future."
". Mr President, in the explanatory statement, the rapporteur states that over half of the population of the 25 Member States of the European Union live in rural areas, which account for 90% of EU territory."
"Agriculture and forestry are the cornerstones of land use and the management of natural resources, and they serve at the same time as the basis for economic diversification there."
"I am in total agreement with the rapporteur."
"However, I would add that in my country, Ireland, small and medium-sized family farms are the very backbone of Irish society."
"Down the years they have given us security of basic food supplies, they have contributed to protecting the environment, and they have promoted rural interests."
"I would add that one in eleven people in the workforce in Ireland is employed in the agricultural sector."
"I would add that the agri-food sector is a vital player in the Irish economy, accounting for 8% of gross domestic product and furthermore that 7% of Irish exports, and about one fifth of Ireland’s net foreign earnings, come from traded goods from Irish agriculture."
"Also I want to emphasise that in 2004 Irish agricultural exports exceeded EUR 7 billion."
"In a word, agriculture in Ireland is a vital national interest."
"Continued rural development in my country is therefore vital."
"On the key issue of funding of the agricultural fund for European development, I have some misgivings, because unless there is unanimous agreement in Council on the financial prospectus for the period 2007 to 2013, this whole project could find itself in limbo land."
"In view of recent developments, notably the massive rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French farming community, who, it must be said, have been one of the main beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy down the years, perhaps the Commissioner could tell us if, in the event that there is no rapid agreement on future financing, there will be a ‘plan B’ for rural development"
"Only last week the Agriculture Council adopted conclusions on the European Union forestry action policy."
"The Council of Ministers acknowledged, inter alia, that the economic, ecological and social relevance of the forest sector in the EU and the contribution that forest and forestry can provide to the Lisbon objectives of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness, as well as to the Göteborg objectives of safeguarding the quantity and quality of the national resource base."
"Consequently I do not support the Commission’s approach to forestry in its rural development programme."
"Its proposed premium period of ten years is far too short and its proposed grant rate is too low."
"In fact the Commission proposals represent a reduction on existing grant rates."
"Can we not do better?"
"Because we need to do much better than this."
"Contradictory approaches are almost impossible to explain to the non-initiated general public, and, in my opinion, completely undermine our collective credibility."
"Finally, let me record my opposition to the proposed minimum expenditure levels in the Commission’s proposal."
"I believe that they are contrary to the principle of subsidiarity."
"I believe that they do not take account of flexibility to respond to diverse rural needs. In fact I would prefer no prescribed minimums at all."
"Mr President, it is a time of unprecedented change in agriculture."
"Agriculture in my constituency of Northern Ireland still remains our most significant industry."
"Therefore it is vital that the rural development regulation aids, rather than aggravates, our situation."
"This funding must not be prioritised unfairly to the new Member States, with gross disadvantage to the EU-15."
"‘We pay, they spend’ simply will not do."
"Indeed, I believe the allocation of rural funding should bear some proportionality to the budgetary contributions of Member States."
"I want to see Axis I, in particular, accentuated, not diminished, with money actually getting to farmers, not being hijacked into government departments."
"Rather, money from Axis I should be ring-fenced and targeted to the agricultural community, which is directly involved in farming."
"Remember that it is the farmers who, through a whopping 9.5% modulation from the single farm payment in 2006, are going to be key funders."
"I also want to see maximum regional flexibility permitted within the regulation."
"Flexibility, minimum regulation and a belief that farming and rural development are allies, not alternatives are, in my opinion, the way to proceed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by warmly thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber."
"She has done a great piece of work with this report, which seeks to strike a balance between many different interests, all of which have something to be said for them."
"Sixty per cent of the population and 90% of the territory of the EU."
"These two figures really do bring home the importance of rural development as the second pillar of the European Union’s agricultural policy."
"The EU population can be content only if the rural population is content."
"In the light of recent political developments and the failed referendum, we must not only be more aware of the need for acceptance of European policy, it must quite definitely be to the fore everywhere."
"In view of the empty coffers and the fighting over distribution, I must also point out that, historically, the EU budget was an agricultural budget."
"The policy areas that were added later must not be allowed to overshadow this historic core of Europe."
"That is why there are also calls for rural development funds, which are part of agricultural funding, to remain primarily with farmers in projects related to farming."
"I therefore expressly support Mrs Schierhuber’s proposed financial appropriations for all three main axes."
"It is very important that the support available for very small enterprises should also be extended to medium-sized undertakings in rural areas."
"We must also join the rapporteur in calling for Natura 2000, financing for which has still not been settled, not to be funded out of second pillar resources but out of additional money."
"At this point I would like once again to extend my sincere thanks to Mrs Schierhuber and to everyone else who has worked so hard on this important report."
"In the light of the above points, this report has earned our support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the echo of the 'no' to the European Constitution from two nations which, possibly for different reasons, voted against it, is particularly loud in plenary of the European Parliament."
"It is a fact that it has created insecurity among citizens as to what is going on within these walls – in other words, as to how the Community institutions take decisions – and insecurity as to the continuation and stability of European social, economic and development policies."
"One of the policies which does not guarantee a stable, long-term economic and business framework is the CAP."
"The common agricultural policy is being amended and reformed not mainly as a result of the need to resolve its inherent problems but, above all, due to outside pressure, such as that being exerted by the World Trade Organisation, bilateral trade agreements and the financial perspectives of the European Union."
"An effort is being made, through the financial perspectives in particular, to express new renationalisation trends in the European Union, by reducing the Community budget and renationalising the financing of Community policies such as the CAP."
"Although this policy is criticised for having created financially privileged farmers in certain areas of the European Union, instead of discussing the question of the redistribution of Community resources in order to reduce these blatant discrepancies, its cofinancing is being promoted, which will exacerbate these discrepancies."
"If rural development is to strengthen the rural economy and keep pace with sustainable regional development, it needs resources and integrated planning."
"The resources proposed by the Commission and in the Presidency's compromise proposals will not result in a stronger rural development policy, which will give new opportunities and will introduce innovations so that the rural sector can approach the Lisbon targets."
"The reclassification of disadvantaged regions, excluding the criterion of employment, makes a sitting target of the Commission, which appears to be taking decisions solely on the basis of technocratic criteria, such as soil composition."
"No account is taken of the real problems of the countryside, which has been struck by rising unemployment."
"The duration of development programmes should be seven years, in accordance also with the implementation of the CAP, in order to give producers and the food industries a constant timeframe."
"I absolutely agree with the comments and proposals in Mrs Schierhuber's excellent report."
"The 'no' vote in the two recent referenda cannot take us backwards; it must convince us to say 'yes' to the major structural development policies for a Europe of cohesion and solidarity."
"Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to Mrs Schierhuber for the enthusiasm with which she has, as usual, presented her report."
"I too am in favour of maintaining a liveable countryside in Europe, and I can therefore endorse the Commission’s three objectives."
"However, I fail to appreciate why the Commission has to prescribe that a certain percentage must be used for one objective and another percentage for another objective, and so on for the whole of Europe. Certainly after the referendum in the Netherlands and perhaps that in France as well – to which, indeed, a few people have already referred – it is necessary to keep rules from Brussels to an absolute minimum."
"We are quite capable of deciding for ourselves and the Commission can establish afterwards whether the funds were spent wisely or not."
"With regard to the report in general, there are a few too many gifts for the different regions for my liking."
"There is no disadvantaged region in Europe that has not been mentioned."
"We could well end up with a lack of funds for the ordinary regions in Europe, which have countryside of their own."
"I do not think that the amendment that argues in favour of an increase in the total sum for rural policy has any realistic changes, but, fortunately, a has been added to say that that is conditional on the outcome of the vote on the report on the Financial Perspectives."
"I should also like to stand up for sound quality policy in Europe."
"Certainly if liberalisation is on the increase, and we prescribe entirely different conditions for the rest of the world, it is unfair to expect European farmers to compete freely."
"Someone who sells to us will need to do so under our conditions, but those conditions will need to be known and that is where European quality policy comes in."
"I should like to welcome Agnes Schierhuber’s report on the Commission’s proposal for the EAFRD."
"I endorse the view expressed in her report, which sees the Commission’s proposal as positive, but in need of some specific improvements."
"I welcome the Commission’s proposals that aim to enhance the environment and the countryside through support for land management."
"Equally important is the aim of enhancing the quality of life in rural areas and promoting diversification of economic activities, through measures targeting farm sector and rural actors."
"I also welcome the fact that through the establishment of a single rural development fund, bureaucracy and duplication are reduced."
"I welcome the proposals in Mrs Schierhuber’s report to promote equality of opportunity and the participation of women in farming and in the wider rural economy."
"Support for organic farming is also important."
"The Commission’s proposed budget of EUR 88.75 billion for 2007-2013 at 2004 prices was also welcome."
"We would still face considerable problems even with this amount."
"It is vital that such funds are used to meet the objectives of improving the quality of life of our family farming communities and the protection of our rural environment."
"There is a need for the aims and objectives of Natura 2000 to be mainstreamed into all aspects of EU agricultural and rural development policy and funding."
"Farmers, foresters and other land managers should be appropriately supported for protecting and maintaining Natura 2000 sites."
"Resources should be put into the fund for the 2007-2013 period that will enable this to happen."
"Otherwise, we seriously run the risk of repeating past mistakes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the field of human activity that we are debating today is a special one, as agriculture amounts to nothing less than the means of our biological existence."
"At the same time, however, we all know that agriculture is not only significant in economic terms, but also in social, environmental and cultural terms."
"I should therefore like to pay tribute to Mrs Schierhuber for the effort she has put into drafting such an excellent report."
"We are well aware that the current trend is for more and more of those living in the countryside to have only loose ties with agriculture, with the result being a large overlap between agricultural policy and regional policy."
"It therefore needs to be possible to carry out multiple agricultural activities in a rational manner in rural areas, thus ensuring that agricultural products of the highest possible quality can be produced and processed."
"At the same time, people living in such areas ought to be guaranteed adequate living conditions."
"Further issues that must not be neglected in rural areas include family and social ties and cultural concerns, as well as ecology and tourism."
"There are a number of issues to which I should like to alert the House."
"The Member States must be aware that adequate funding should also be set aside in national budgets and used solely for rural development."
"Secondly, use of EAFRD funding at local level to promote integration or SMEs should be as wide as possible."
"My third point is that geographic conditions should be taken into account when distributing funds, for example the unique nature of mountainous or semi-mountainous areas."
"Fourthly, serious consideration needs to be given to the education system in the countryside, and to the provision of agricultural advice."
"The fifth point I should like to make is that rural areas need infrastructure, or in other words roads, water supplies, sewage systems, telephone lines and Internet access, and that this infrastructure must meet today’s requirements."
"Basic medical care must also be available in these areas, as well as access to cultural and recreational facilities and high-quality education, to reiterate a point I made earlier."
"I propose that more funding be set aside to regenerate rural areas."
"If it were placed under the control of local communities, such money would certainly not go to waste."
"Mr President, what we need to do today, I believe, is to send a very clear signal to Europe’s countryside."
"Whatever major changes may occur in the market, Europe must remain visible, tangible and recognisable."
"What became apparent last week was that ‘market, market, market’, in other words money alone, does not bring Europe any closer or touch the hearts of the people."
"There is more to it: a social dimension and a liveable countryside."
"That is why it is such a splendid thing that this programme is so broad-based and that the Committee on the Regions, on which I had the privilege of sitting, has adopted amendments which making explicit provision for regional and local involvement and, at the same time, for an integrated approach."
"Not only agriculture, but also natural landscape and tourist activities play their part in this development, and we must actively encourage new features, such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for the sake of business innovation."
"Switching to different functions in the countryside will definitely have an impact in the sort of rural and urban areas that we have in the Netherlands, where plenty of proposals are ready to be tabled in order to make changes by engaging in reconstruction in rural areas."
"These include achieving the Gothenburg and Lisbon objectives, maintaining strong agriculture, and, not least, all the innovation that is possible in processing right down the food chain."
"I should like to endorse Mr Maat’s earlier suggestion that more flexibility be tolerated between the columns and also in the subsidy percentages."
"Finally, Europe is currently being haunted by the spectre of renationalisation."
"It is already rearing its head as a reaction to common European policy, but will be even more prominent in 2013 when the next financial battle will be fought."
"I am opposed to it on the grounds that it leads to less Europe, less recognisability and less closeness to those people in the countryside, a large majority of whom, while looking to Europe, have said ‘no’ to the Constitution."
"Not because that is not what they want, but because there is uncertainty in the policy, and that would be counterproductive."
"I can only congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her work."
"She has prepared an excellent report that would provide an excellent conceptual framework for the distribution of rural development resources, if there were actually any resources to distribute."
"Compared with the Commission’s proposed allocation of 88 billion euros, the most recent negotiating framework, submitted by the Luxembourg Presidency, proposes a drastic reduction to a mere 73-75 billion euros for the period 2007-2013."
"This reduction is a very major one for all Member States, but it is particularly disadvantageous to the new Member States, given that we believed this allocation would offset the discriminatory Copenhagen agreements, as indeed was also promised by Mrs Fischer Boel at her hearing."
"I know that this does not depend on her."
"In the light of the discriminatory direct payments system, this discriminatory payments system will mean that, over seven years, agricultural support per farmer in the old Member States will amount to 48 000 euros, while in the new Member States it will be just 14 000 euros per farmer."
"In other words, farmers in the old Member States will receive three times more over seven years in direct payments and rural development funds than farmers in the new Member States."
"If this reduction does indeed go ahead, please do not let it affect the resources going to the new Member States."
"Mr President, I welcome, as Mrs Schierhuber does in her report, the creation of a single fund to finance the rural development policy and stronger strategic guidelines."
"With regard to the allocation of funds for 2007-2013, I find it regrettable that the financial perspectives propose a reduction in resources."
"It is also regrettable that the proposal for a regulation no longer provides a period of grace for young farmers, as was the case during the 2000-2006 programme."
"That is why I support a return to the previous instrument."
"One solution, when compliance with standards requires investment, could be to allow a period of five years after setting up for this investment."
"During this period, young farmers could continue to benefit from investment aid and would not be penalised for failing to comply with the standards clearly identified in the agricultural development plan."
"Finally, as I am convinced that rural areas are becoming more and more attractive, I have presented some amendments that aim to make this regulation more favourable to rural development, particularly by adding impetus to its non-agricultural component, including craft trades and micro-enterprises."
"Mr President, I welcome this excellent report and congratulate the rapporteur."
"Rural development is going to make a very important contribution to the future of rural society."
"The rural community has been under increasing pressure to survive."
"I believe that when you remove the farmer and his family from rural society, it begins to disintegrate."
"We have already seen what happens: schools, churches and post offices close and people move away from the countryside to the towns."
"I know things must change and I know we have to be prepared for that change, but it has to be for the better."
"We do not want to see further disintegration."
"I believe that the Leader programme has in the main been successful and it should be developed to achieve more at local level."
"There is no magic wand that we can wave to bring about a magic solution."
"But the one thing we do need for the second pillar of the rural economy is money."
"When modulation develops to a larger budget, this must be deployed as direct support to secure the future of the small family farm which is the backbone of the rural economy."
"We must give hope to young farmers and encourage young people to make farming their future."
"The modulation funds must go back to the farmer and must not be thrown away on useless projects that have no hope of surviving."
"More encouragement should be given to farming families to develop small and medium-sized enterprises on their holdings."
"The bureaucratic planning authorities which, with their dogmatic beliefs, are destroying and depopulating rural society, need to show more understanding."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her success in putting before us, with conviction and perseverance, indeed with stubbornness, a balanced compromise which the Council will be able to approve before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Since it is a key part of the 2003 CAP reform that agricultural and forestry production should be preserved, especially in what were up until now less-favoured areas, I have argued for retaining the existing definition of less-favoured areas for the time being, with any changes made only on the basis of a comprehensive study."
"We cannot simply drop compensation payments in those areas because the current definition no longer applies."
"That would be an outright social, economic and ecological disaster for agriculture in my country in particular, because sadly 96% of the agricultural area is of course less-favoured."
"I am therefore relieved that my amendments have been accepted."
"That is not in farmers’ interests alone; without them, the rural area in which more than 50% of the EU’s total population still live and which makes up 90% of the territory would not exist."
"The results of the vote in the French referendum in the rural areas should give pause for thought to all who believe the common agricultural policy is too expensive."
"It will be even more expensive to combat poverty and crime in the large conurbations if we drive the rural population into them too."
"Support for the countryside and preserving agriculture based on our family farms is money well invested in the European Union."
"As my amendments on the subject were not accepted, I must not of course forget to make clear that beekeeping is also farming and that beekeeping, which is very much at risk, also deserves proper support in rural areas."
"I hope this will also be borne in mind."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without rural development there will be no further agricultural development."
"This theory is backed up by economic and environmental arguments, as well as by social arguments, including those relating to demographic issues."
"I come from Lubelszczyzna, a region in eastern Poland that is one of the 10 poorest in the European Union."
"The majority of people there live in rural areas and run small farms that cover an average of around eight hectares."
"There is an urgent need for these farms to be amalgamated and their lands merged, as farmers often work several dozen different plots."
"Instead of receiving assistance, however, to date most of these farmers have been deprived of the opportunity to grow profitable crops, such as flax, hemp and tobacco, and recently even soft fruit."
"Direct payments for small farms do not provide any guarantee that the people working there will receive a decent income."
"The people living in rural areas are therefore even more worthy of our attention than such matters as the management of these areas and agricultural and forestry production."
"This is all the more true because rural areas are very rich in cultural and environmental terms, in spite of being poor in economic terms."
"Natural landscapes, local dialects and cultural traditions have been preserved there, as well as the ethical and moral values that European society is so sorely in need of today."
"We must ensure that these values remain intact for future generations that will follow us."
"People living in poor regions are in need of particular assistance."
"It is to be welcomed that the Council regulation on support for rural development by the EAFRD we are discussing also covers such issues as the provision of advice, professional training and tourism, even though it unfortunately does not go far enough in this respect."
"It is particularly important that we do not neglect the education of young people."
"We must not forget that we will only achieve our desired results if the measures we take are both comprehensive and well – thought out."
"Finally, I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Schierhuber, who has dealt with a difficult subject and many amendments in an exemplary fashion."
"I would offer her my congratulations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union was confronted with a major challenge following its enlargement to include 10 new Member States."
"We have been debating the new rural development policy for over a year."
"The main goal of this policy is to improve living and working conditions for families living in the countryside and to increase the number of new non-agricultural activities covered."
"The policy also aims to help restructure and modernise agriculture and to increase agricultural competitiveness, at the same time as protecting the environment."
"A solution is needed to the problem of adequate funding for rural areas."
"Poland in particular is in urgent need of such funding, as it is suffering from structural problems and very high unemployment."
"The new Member States should be excluded from any cuts the EU makes to funding for rural development."
"These Member States were told that full direct payments would be phased in over a 10-year period, on the grounds that we were in greater need of funding for rural development, and yet the EU now wishes to curb its spending on the latter."
"If the European Commission wishes rural development in the former cohesion countries to bear the brunt of funding cutbacks, it should ensure that this does not take place at the expense of the new Member States."
"We can only hope that the introduction of a single funding and programming instrument will make it easier to manage and control the new rural development policy."
"State forests, which are home to natural landscapes of exceptional value, should also be eligible for support under the new fund, as otherwise our progress towards the Natura 2000 objectives could be adversely affected."
"Technical assistance should be provided for authorities and local action groups in the new Member States in order to ensure that the LEADER axis can be fully implemented without any problems."
"Particular attention should also be paid to the development of human capital."
"This is especially true in the case of women and young people, who play a leading role in rural development."
"The diversity of the landscape in various European countries also dictates a diversity of conditions for work, especially in the agricultural sector."
"In this way countries with predominantly hilly landscapes cannot match the yield per hectare of those that have much more favourable conditions for farming."
"Nevertheless great harm would be done to each country and landscape from the environmental and strategic aspect, if, owing to the more difficult working conditions, farming and rural development were neglected."
"It therefore makes sense to support the proposal of the Committee for Agriculture regarding support for rural development through the assistance of the European Agricultural Fund."
"Our fathers and grandfathers worked the land from a need to survive and a love for the land, although the effort they put in was never fully repaid."
"And nowadays there are fewer and fewer people who would do this for love, but rather, like those in the commercial or public sectors, they want to earn and create for themselves more favourable working and living conditions."
"For this reason I especially support the proposed support for young farmers, with which they will be able to create the basic conditions for continuing their work."
"We know from our experiences in Slovenia that if a young farmer takes over a farm, he will usually also modernise it and continue to farm successfully."
"If, however, he leaves the farm because he sees no prospects there, he will only rarely come back, since in many cases a living can be earned faster and more easily elsewhere."
"However, modern times demand educated farmers, who will know how to get their products into the market economy and will be familiar with legislation, as well as being innovative and environmentally aware."
"All of this requires a great deal of knowledge and support on the part of society, the European Union, the state and citizens."
"All citizens would like to continue to enjoy healthy food and to live in a beautiful landscape and clean environment."
"For this reason, concern for rural development is a task for the whole of society and not just for farming people."
"To contribute to this there should be simpler regulations, so that in paying out assistance the intermediaries will not all be earning more than the farmers themselves."
"Mr President, the Commission’s document and Parliament’s report set out a great many key proposals for ways in which assistance could be provided to rural areas, and especially to agricultural areas."
"I should like to focus on two particular issues that relate to non-agricultural matters."
"The first of these is infrastructure, or in other words water, roads, sewage systems and telephone lines, all of which are necessary in order to improve standards of living in rural areas."
"The second is education, since people from the countryside must be given the same educational opportunities as those from towns."
"Amongst other things, this would help stop the rural exodus."
"A new trend has been noted, namely for people to move back to the countryside, but with the sole aim of living close to nature."
"It is important for country people to be able to work there in order to fulfil themselves professionally, notably within small and medium-sized enterprises."
"People are moving away from the countryside."
"The proposal to encourage people to move back there will help maintain a demographic balance and reduce the negative selection process that stems from rural-urban migration."
"Communication technologies and new forms of transport mean that a great many people could live and work in rural areas."
"IT specialists and SME owners are but two examples."
"In order to do so, however, these individuals must be provided with the appropriate conditions, or at least some form of assistance."
"If we were to take such action, we would help preserve the tradition of family businesses, and at the same time strengthen family ties."
"The latter are of inestimable value for modern-day Europe."
"We would also ensure the survival of the values without which Europe, in the shape of the EU, would be unable to function and would lose its ."
"To sum up, money invested in rural areas will not go to waste."
"Europe will profit greatly from such investment in many key respects."
". Mr President, I should like to thank you for the very valuable and constructive contribution you have made with your opinion on the rural development regulation."
"I am convinced that your concerns, particularly substantial on the first and second axes, have helped us to understand better the key issues that are important to the European citizens whom you represent in this Parliament."
"I should like to comment on a few of the issues raised here tonight."
"First of all, the minimum spending rates, which several Members mentioned."
"The Commission is open to a balance between axes, leaving more margin to the Member States."
"However, the proposed rate of 8% for Axis 3, compared to the 15% proposed by the Commission, is too little."
"Please do not forget that measures under Axis 3, if used correctly, can contribute significantly to promoting economic growth and job creation in rural areas."
"This is clearly in the interest of farmers and their families and it is closely linked to what we want to achieve under the Lisbon Strategy."
"Someone mentioned the need for Members to be allowed to prioritise rural development funds on the third axis."
"They have plenty of room to do this with the minimum rates that we have proposed."
"But we also need to ensure that Member States have a minimum of balance so that they address the variety of challenges in rural areas."
"Regarding young farmers: they need to have the business plan."
"Apart from agri-environment, the Commission is not willing to make other measures compulsory."
"If there is a real problem for young farmers in a Member State, the national strategy should address it and propose the appropriate measures."
"On the other hand, the business plans should not be over prescriptive at this stage."
"If needed, additional provisions can be included in the implementing regulations."
"As Commissioner McCreevy already mentioned, we also accept the extension of support for young farmers to subsidise loans."
"I also noted your comments on the grace period for young farmers concerning the minimum standards."
"Let me be very clear on this: there cannot be a blank cheque for young farmers."
"In principle, they have to comply with cross-compliant standards just as other farmers have to do."
"However, I am prepared to consider one exception to this principle: when a young farmer takes over a farm that has problems in meeting one standard or another, he can identify this deficit in his business plan and provide for the action needed to address the problems."
"In this case, it would make sense to give him some time to adapt and during this period we would not penalise him for non-compliance with the standards concerned."
"On less-favoured areas, you asked me to look at the inclusion of socio-economic criteria and phasing-out periods for areas that have lost their status."
"The Commission proposed a change as regards the present intermediate less-favoured areas."
"Mountain areas and specific less-favoured areas remain as they are today."
"Member States are requested to confirm or to modify their current delimination in their programmes."
"But for the intermediate less-favoured areas, there is an agreement that we need to change the approach in the light of the criticism from the European Court of Auditors, which is also shared by this Parliament."
"The Commission recognises that more time is needed for this work and that we need to review the criteria we have proposed so far."
"Let us, however, keep in mind that the criteria we use have to be objective to the WTO to be able to fit into the green box."
"In this context, a phasing-out period for the existing intermediate less-favoured areas can be considered."
"In 2008, the Commission will present to Parliament and to the Council a report accompanied by a proposal in view of an entry into force in 2010."
"You also suggested we bring the co-financing rate for the outermost regions and the Greek islands up to 85%, as is proposed in the cohesion policy regulation."
"Please let me explain why we proposed a slightly different approach."
"Firstly, like you, I believe that the co-financing rates for these regions should be higher."
"This is why we proposed a co-financing rate that is actually 5% higher for each axis."
"However, it is good to maintain a certain differentiation between the axes to express the importance that we attach to the second and the fourth."
"The cohesion policy proposal does not distinguish between axes and, therefore, has no such differentiation."
"In addition, we offer in our proposal a number of specific advantages to operators in the outermost regions."
"Such specific advantages do not exist under the cohesion policy."
"Some of you mentioned modulation money to be targeted only against the first and the second axis."
"This is not possible, because once the modulation amounts are made available they are part of the programming as a whole and should be allocated based on needs identified in the national strategic programmes."
"On Natura 2000, we have to strike a delicate balance."
"Rural development funds can, and should, contribute, but they can never be the only source of funding to solve this problem."
"It is very important for me to underline that there must be other sources so that rural development is not the only banker."
"I believe that with our new regulation, including the improvements made by the European Parliament, we will have a solid basis for our rural development in future."
"However, we also need the money, which many of you have mentioned tonight."
"The financial perspective will be the moment of truth."
"I hope I can count on your support to make it possible to maintain as much money as possible in this very important area."
"I thank you once again for your excellent work."
"I heard Mr Mulder say that the rapporteur had given a vintage performance."
"I completely agree."
"It has been a pleasure for me to cooperate with the members of the Committee on Agriculture."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would really like to thank you very much for what you have said."
"I think it shows that we have moved very much closer in the essential things that are important to us all."
"I think what you said about the less-favoured areas, small and medium-sized enterprises and young farmers in particular was very good."
"If modulation must be applied to all axes, then we must also pay close attention to the level of their appropriations."
"Again, Commissioner, my sincere thanks to you and your staff for your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Rosa Díez González, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the EU anti-terrorism Action Plan (2004/2214(INI)) (A6-0164/2005),"

"and of the oral questions by Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz to the Council and the Commission on European Union capabilities to respond to public health threats posed by bioterrorism (B6-0243/2005 and B6-0244/2005)."
". Mr President, today is an important day."
"This global debate once again places the European Parliament at the forefront of the fight against terrorism."
"We are a political House and this is a political debate on the measures to be taken by Europe to defend human rights and beat terrorism, and it is a debate that is also intended to provide lessons in democracy."
"We are convinced that, in order to be effective in the fight against terrorism, Europe must have a common policy in this area as well, in order to go beyond the increasingly close and effective cooperation amongst the countries of the Union – of which Spain and France are a good example – and between the Union and third countries; a policy that responds to the concerns of the citizens and that can be promoted as a model throughout the world."
"Beating terrorism requires, firstly, a belief in the supremacy of democracy."
"Beating terrorism requires that we be prepared to use all the instruments of the rule of law, all of them, but no more than those that the rule of law allows us."
"Beating terrorism requires that we combat impunity and deprive terrorist action of any legitimacy."
"Beating terrorism requires that we keep the memory of its victims alive in our hearts."
"Terrorism, ladies and gentlemen, is a form of totalitarianism, of fanaticism."
"Terrorism seeks to destroy free and plural societies."
"Terrorism is incompatible with democracy."
"I would therefore state that only a strong, vigorous and committed democracy will be able to beat it."
"This House has been at the forefront in this field on more than one occasion."
"On 6 September 2001, just days before the attack on the Twin Towers, two recommendations were adopted here: the arrest warrant and the common definition of the crime of terrorism, which were able to be adopted by the Council in December of that same year thanks to the fact that we, the European Parliament, had done our work on time."
"It is true that there are some countries of the Union that have yet to transpose them into their legislation and there are others that have not done so adequately."
"The report for which I am rapporteur therefore calls for an urgent evaluation, but these two decisions are an example of the extent to which the European citizens need a Parliament that is able to be at the forefront of political decisions."
"Europe is a model of democracy and respect for human rights."
"That is our vocation, that is the purpose of our political union."
"We therefore combat terrorism in order to defend and promote democracy and in order to guarantee respect for human rights, because we know that terrorism is the enemy of democracy."
"We therefore propose a European policy to combat terrorism in order to guarantee respect for collective and individual human rights, the right to life, freedom of expression, freedom of movement, ideological freedom and religious freedom: a European policy that combats terrorism in order to make collective security compatible with individual freedom and dignity."
"I am not going to bore you with the details of every recommendation in the report."
"They are all pioneering, but they are all possible."
"They only require political will and they are all necessary."
"They range from enhancing the role of the European anti-terrorism coordinator to promoting the creation of the post of European public prosecutor."
"I would like to highlight the recommendation that we institutionalise a European recognition of the victims of terrorism."
"Also politically significant is our commitment to promote an international definition of the crime of terrorism, something which is increasingly necessary if we want, as proposed by Kofi Annan in the Madrid Agenda, these crimes to be pursued and punished throughout the world."
"I would finally like to draw attention to a truly ambitious recommendation: the request that the Member States not allow terrorist crimes to be time-barred, thereby reflecting the reprobation of the international community, which considers them to be some of the most serious and inadmissible crimes against humanity."
"I will end, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I know that this is a small step that we are taking today, but it is an important step."
"And I am proud of having contributed to placing the European Parliament once again at the forefront of the fight against the impunity of criminals and at the forefront of the defence of human rights."
"I would like to thank all of my fellow Members, and all of the political groups, for their contributions to this long debate."
"Thanks to all of them, this House is going to propose proactive initiatives to the Council that will change the dynamic of the past."
"This series of initiatives is aimed at drawing up a European policy that is capable of preventing terrorism as far as possible."
"As a Socialist, as a Basque, as a Spaniard and as a European, I am proud that this Parliament is once again acknowledging the memory of the victims of terrorism."
"The President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, reiterated his commitment last Saturday at a Civil Guard diploma ceremony, where he stated that all of the victims will remain in our memories forever."
"For every democrat, that commitment, to remember the victims, must make societies such as the ones which the terrorists pursue through their crimes impossible."
"Europe knows about totalitarianism and it knows about the importance of keeping memories alive in order to prevent history from being repeated."
"Primo Levi explained it very well in a magnificent book: ‘To understand is impossible, but to know is necessary and to remember is a duty’."
"–I should like to welcome our former colleague, Mr De Vries, who is following the debate from the Council benches."
". Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Commissioner Frattini and the Council’s coordinator of the fight against terrorism, Mr Gijs de Vries, for being here this morning."
"I would also like to thank all the MEPs who have worked and cooperated, sometimes on the basis of discrepancies and sometimes on the basis of agreement, on this report on the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks and I would like in particular to thank my good friends Rosa Díez and Antoine Duquesne for their cooperation and their contributions to this report."
"In the few minutes available to me I would like to be very concise and in particular to summarise the reasons and objectives that have inspired me to present this report in the European Parliament today."
"What have I wanted to contribute today in this House by means of this report?"
"Simply the little I have been able to learn, my limited and modest experience of what fighting a terrorist organisation has meant, for more than twenty-five years, in my country, Spain, and in the Basque Country."
"I therefore believe that the most important thing today is to turn the European Union's traditional approach to combating terrorism, which has usually been by means of an exhaustive list of measures, into what I believe must be a European political project."
"You may ask me what the difference is between an exhaustive list of measures and a political project."
"A political project is much more ambitious than a list of measures."
"A political project is always the result of a priority, of an emphasis and, above all, of an appropriate and correct mindset."
"And a political project, above all, has the capacity to be summed up and understood simultaneously by a public opinion that appreciates the efforts of a politician to turn that list of measures into a political project."
"Allow me to point out that the recent results in Europe confirm to us that we need a limited number of political projects, because there cannot be infinite political projects."
"We must have just a few political projects, which are understood by the European citizens and able to tackle their problems."
"And I believe that one of them is unquestionably terrorism."
"Terrorism cannot be fought in a generalised fashion."
"The security forces cannot take on the correct mindset if we are fighting terrorism in a generalised fashion."
"We must combat a particular type of terrorism, a particular organisation."
"It is true that it must always be fought on the basis of the same principles of freedom, of respect for human rights, of the ideas upon which Europe is based, but in each case we must be able to create a particular concrete political project, and we must always be able to specify, determine and measure the organisation being fought; amongst other reasons, as I said before, because that is the only way to stimulate the security forces to put every possible effort into combating a particular organisation."
"What is a terrorist organisation’s main ally?"
"Its dispersed nature: we never know where it begins and ends; we do not know what social structure sustains it nor which States, on occasions, are behind that group."
"But it always has social support, and one of the keys to combating the phenomenon of terrorism is to be aware of the range of the organisation and of the social strata supporting it."
"For this reason – and I regret certain amendments to this effect - I regret that we have not had the courage to call the organisation that the Europeans are faced with, which is a radical, Islamist organisation, or one that claims to defend Islam, that is to say Al Qaeda, by its name."
"It is essential to call it by its name, because that is the only way to combat an organisation: we must be able to say what we are currently facing in the European Union."
"The main risk facing the European Parliament is paralysis, inaction, being sure of our principles and values and being in general agreement, but not creating a common European political project to deal with this great issue that is going to affect our present and our future, and treating it as if it were somebody else’s problem: as if it were something that happened to the Americans on 11 September, a few years ago, or specifically to Spain, for particular reasons, on 11 March, but I do not believe that that is what we should do."
"In conclusion, I would like to remember the victims and say that they must always be at the centre of our debate, the main focus of our attention, I would repeat that, on this issue, we must all have the moral strength together with them fundamentally to tackle this issue which is essential in terms of our future."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, in the fight against terrorism, fear is the worst enemy and advocate."
"It paralyses the population and affects its sense of security and that is how terrorists win."
"It also reduces the resistance of the population and causes governments anxiety about suppressive measures, which often infringe fundamental freedoms."
"Here again terrorists win."
"The best way, therefore, to limit this fear is for us to be ready, as Europe, both to prevent terrorist attacks and their repercussions and – if a terrorist attack ultimately occurs – to be ready to deal with the repercussions of the attack in the best possible way, in other words by mitigating them both for the population as a whole and for the victims."
"Why should we do this together, rather than each of us separately?"
"Firstly, because terrorism has no borders and our critical infrastructures often have no borders now either."
"We cannot each deal with an issue which has pan-European repercussions alone."
"Secondly, because we have committed to this Europe, not only through economic ties, but also through ties of solidarity."
"In the case of terrorism in particular, we declared in the new European Constitution on 25 March 2004 that we clearly need to operate together."
"But what should we do together?"
"In prevention and in the protection of critical infrastructures, I would say to you that it is extremely important for there to be a Commission proposal approved by Parliament for a programme to protect critical infrastructures."
"The Member States, in cooperation with the infrastructure operators, who are mostly private operators, must each define these critical infrastructures using a harmonised European method."
"We need to analyse their sensitivity and assess the threats, which means that we need to exchange information on these systems."
"For example, my country might have information about a possible threat to another country."
"We need to find solutions for their protection, as well as for an adequate reaction if an attack takes place."
"At the same time, we need to safeguard confidentiality, so that the owners of these infrastructures can exchange information in advance."
"In other words, they must be able to warn each other about possible attacks."
"We need to safeguard financing."
"We need to safeguard, above all, the protection of fundamental freedoms in this process."
"The ends do not justify the means."
"We need to safeguard a recognisable and achievable timetable and independent monitoring by Europe as regards support for this timetable for prescribing infrastructures."
"We cannot simply shell out money with no timetable."
"What can we do for the purpose of crisis management?"
"We need here to create a European civil protection force and safeguard European financing for its movements."
"This is the biggest cost."
"You can have a database so that you can coordinate throughout Europe – if a disaster strikes one country, which other countries will help and with what forces – but it costs money."
"We must have cooperation with non-governmental organisations and local authorities."
"They are all involved in the event of a disaster, be it a terrorist attack or a natural disaster."
"All the early-warning systems must be unified in ARGUS."
"There must be a crisis management, coordination and monitoring and information processing centre in Europe."
"We also need, as Europe, to consult the national authorities with experience."
"I mention this because, with the Olympic Games in Greece in 2004, we organised what was probably the biggest civil protection and infrastructure protection operation in the history of the entire world."
"The European Commission cannot organise such a large-scale programme without consulting authorities such as these."
"What should we not do together?"
"We do not want green, red or orange alerts to the world."
"We cannot create a climate of panic."
"In creating a climate of panic, we have created what the terrorists want: the fear I mentioned at the beginning."
"Nor do we want preventive wars against terrorism."
"They are either wars against nation states or they are wars against fundamental rights."
"There is a huge temptation at the moment, in numerous countries around the world, to restrict fundamental rights, allegedly so that we can combat terrorism."
"Nor do we want to address terrorism solely as a police matter."
"That is not and should not be the way we combat it."
"Nor do we want specific terrorists to be demonised, because that way we turn them into heroes, or the victims to be ignored."
"We have to remember these people."
"Terrorists want the opposite; they want us to ignore them."
"Thank you for listening and thank you to all my honourable friends for adopting this report unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I hope that we shall achieve a great deal together in the future."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures listed in the Hague Programme, primarily concerning money laundering, the funding of terrorism and exchanges of information among the Member States, must be carried out quickly and effectively."
"That is one of the aims proposed in my report."
"Such an objective must be fulfilled while observing the privacy of personal data – a point on which many Members have insisted during the debate – with a view to strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, which are severely threatened by international terrorism."
"Terrorism is funded primarily through the traffic in arms and drugs, and it is clear that transactions made by such groups controlling trafficking of this kind involve official banking and financial institutions."
"Measures for preventing and countering the funding of terrorism, therefore, must centre on these institutions."
"From this standpoint, we warmly welcome the commitment made on behalf of the Commission by Mr Frattini – whom we thank for his report – for the immediate presentation to the European Parliament of a proposal for a regulation on the traceability of financial transactions."
"We believe that this initiative, for which we acknowledge the Commission, is practical, speedy and effective."
"There is another equally substantial issue, moreover, of judicial cooperation."
"How is it possible for an individual judge – and in Italy there are many of them engaged intensely and effectively in the fight against terrorism – to act without adequate instruments of cooperation and exchange of information?"
"That is a problem that still needs to be resolved."
"I do not intend to underestimate the concerns voiced by many Members about the issue of personal data protection, but one requirement must take priority: to crush the terrorist headquarters that threaten citizens."
"It is necessary to reflect carefully, therefore, on the need for cooperation in the exchange of information and on the requirement for an instrument that will allow us to stop terrorism in real time, by means of effective measures and intervention, in order to prevent crocodile tears from being shed at a later date for the hundreds of dead victims of the attacks, or, worse still, of biological terror attacks."
"It is obvious that the organisation and operational development of terrorist networks entails constantly evolving methods and techniques, which also include infiltrations."
"From this standpoint, and whilst having the highest regard for the work and the selflessness of not-for-profit organisations, I felt it necessary to stress the real danger of not-for-profit charitable organisations being infiltrated by terrorist groups, as many investigations have already documented."
"These organisations must ensure maximum transparency in managing their funds, must exclusively use official bank accounts and standard financial channels, and must publish their budget plans – this also protects the not-for-profit sector, which is a source of pride for European civil society."
"Let us not forget, moreover, the implementation of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering) recommendations, which take on great importance in devising new rules for bank transfers. These rules are an absolute prerequisite in enabling us to single out the source and recipients of the transfers, who must not take cover behind ghost companies."
"I would like to conclude by recalling the still entirely unresolved issue of financial and tax havens, both inside and outside the European Union, which even today can offer a veil of protection to the international terrorist organisations that threaten the peace and security of European citizens."
"Mr President, terrorism is an amorphous and multifaceted phenomenon which has hit Europe hard and which, unfortunately, will continue to pose a major threat to our democracies if we fail to reach a wide-ranging consensus in order to fight it, if there is not a firm commitment to cooperation between us and if we do not adopt an overarching strategy to eradicate it."
"It is not enough to react, we need to anticipate and be ahead of the game."
"Above all, terrorism must be unanimously condemned at a political level, and in order to do that, Europe must equip itself with effective means to do so."
"I am therefore delighted with the five reports that we are to vote upon today, as each of them sets out very specific actions against this blight on our world, and I feel reassured by the conviction that I share with Mrs Diéz González, Mr Mayor Oreja, Mr Lambridinis and Mr Borghezio."
"I hope that these reports will be adopted, if not unanimously - which would be ideal - then at least by a very substantial majority."
"Exchanges of information have a key part to play in preventing the menace of terrorism and in effectively combating major crime."
"However, if such exchanges of information are to be truly effective, we must, as a matter of urgency, impose some order and coherence on the controls already in force and check, by means of a thorough assessment, that they offer real added value."
"We must avoid sacrificing security on the altar of efficiency, while at the same time not letting efficiency be undermined by bland platitudes."
"Let there be no mistake about this: when it comes to the war on terror, we have nothing to fear from waging that war democratically and with determination while respecting the law."
"The danger lies in not reacting at all."
"To that extent, I believe that the proposal for a Council decision is helpful, because it strengthens vertical cooperation by involving Europol and Eurojust, and provides for analysis."
"The Swedish proposal is helpful because it provides for swift bilateral exchanges as part of horizontal cooperation between the services in the Member States."
"To my mind, these proposals complement one another."
"The amendments adopted in committee serve to make these measures more effective, in particular by providing for information to be available on previous convictions, by facilitating spontaneous exchanges of useful information, by setting deadlines for the exchange of information, by providing for an obligation to justify any refusal to supply information, by providing for an annual report to be presented to Parliament and by giving the Court of Justice the power of interpretation."
"Furthermore, we are proposing for the first time that there should be a coherent set of controls that establishes common standards of data protection under the third pillar equivalent to those under the first pillar, in particular by creating a new joint supervisory body."
"In this way it will finally be possible to convey to the police in very simple and specific terms, possibly by means of a code, what amounts to good practice."
"This will allow objections which are very often used to justify inaction to be set aside."
"Although we are simply being asked for our opinion, we are taking the initiative by formulating precise proposals."
"If the vote is largely in favour, as was the case in committee, it will be impossible for the Council and the Commission to turn a deaf ear and to ignore proposals that I believe to be well balanced."
"We have a very important political role to play here, and I am convinced that Mr Frattini and Mr de Vries will heed what we say and convey our views."
"We also need to react as a matter of urgency to other vitally important dossiers, such as the European register of convictions and the fight against the financing of terrorism, because terrorism is dependent upon money."
"Hence the vital importance of regulations to prevent money laundering and identify the holders of bank accounts financing major crime."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I have said, terrorism has many facets."
"The most important threat we face today is the violence committed by the amorphous terrorist groupings that wrongly claim the right to invoke Islam."
"There are also other threats, however."
"In waging the war on terror, we must make sure to identify our various targets properly."
"We need to be aware of the links between terrorism and major crime."
"We also need to set up an early warning system by strengthening cooperation between information services and by providing better protection for locations most at risk."
"There is also a great deal to be done as regards prevention."
"We must not let ourselves be fooled by the excuses that terrorists use to justify the unjustifiable."
"Nevertheless they do relate to problems that often genuinely exist and need to be addressed and that represent a breeding ground for people driven to despair and therefore susceptible to terrorist lunacy."
"Prevention also involves educating people to the danger of certain statements, and requires us to convey the importance of democracy as regards tolerant debate and respect for the opinions of others."
"We must also have the capacity to react appropriately when the worst happens."
"In such cases, solidarity must be the order of the day: specific political solidarity that marshals all our resources and energy both to provide assistance and to crack down on such acts."
"We need to think still more about the victims of terrorism."
"They need to be involved in the process not only so that we might respond to their concerns but also so that we might demonstrate to them that efforts are being made to ensure that such disasters never happen again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our greatest weapon in the face of barbaric acts is our passionate commitment to freedom and democracy, underpinned by human rights."
"Once again, if we are proactive and unanimous we can defeat those whose dream is to destroy the ideals at the heart of Europe."
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mr de Vries, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Duquesne has already given a detailed explanation of the need for action to curb, combat and prevent terrorism in Europe and throughout the world."
"In the context of the reports on the table, and particularly the one for which I am responsible, the report on the retention of data, I should like to remind the House of what the European Court of Justice has said with regard to the war on terrorism, namely that governments must constantly consider whether all the resources they deploy and all the measures they enact, however legitimate they may be, are not actually endangering what they are intended to protect."
"In some cases, this may be the existence of a free society; in others it may be the right of personal privacy."
"I heartily agree with the shadow rapporteurs, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to them, that we are not fundamentally opposed to the proposals made by the governments of the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden."
"We would certainly insist, however, that measures involving significant curtailments of fundamental rights, which – as all law students learn in the first term at every European university – must always be properly justified, are based on a needs assessment which endorses the measures in question."
"This assessment should not be confined to identifying the need for action but should also outline the benefits of retaining, as a matter of course, data from public telecommunications networks – the Internet, landlines, mobile phones and SMS – which could relate to any of 450 million people."
"The main problem I should like to re-examine in this context is that of the procedural method."
"I am grateful for the communication we have received."
"With the best will in the world, however, I have to say that the procedure leaves a great deal of scope for improvement."
"The report on which you will vote today is based on a draft dating from April of last year."
"In the meantime, the Council’s proposal has undergone several amendments."
"The most recent proposal dates from 24 May."
"Since then the Commission has taken the initiative to introduce its own proposals."
"Since Parliament is not up to date on these, not having been involved in the latest discussions to the extent of receiving a new document through official channels, we can scarcely be expected to express unbounded enthusiasm about the cooperation of the other institutions in this matter."
"Perhaps some thought should be given to ways of improving interinstitutional cooperation if we want to succeed in combating terrorism."
"To deal briefly with the report itself, in the old version – and similar problems may well exist in the new version too – we identified technical defects with regard to the means of enforcement."
"It is a matter of creating databases designed to store as much data as it is possible and necessary to retain; it is a matter of ascertaining how easily ways can be found to circumvent the provisions contained in the present proposal and how easy or difficult it may and must be for the relevant industry to effect the requisite structural changes – and this is the economic crux of the matter – without the need for compensation."
"Perhaps some of the new proposals set out different rules on this last point, but there was certainly no provision for compensation in the version on which we had to base our deliberations."
"The other question we had to examine was a legal one: to what extent is the proposed system compatible with the right to respect for private and family life as defined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?"
"To what extent is it compatible with the fundamental rights enshrined in our national constitutions, such as the right to determine the disclosure and use of one’s own personal data, as in Germany, and the right of telephone privacy, which presumably exists in every Member State, to store the data of all European citizens?"
"In which country will the framework decision first be declared unconstitutional, if it is adopted at all?"
"Another aspect is the political message conveyed in the justification of the first document, which states that the system should be deliberately designed to include those who have never come under suspicion so that it can achieve the goal of combating terrorism and organised crime as comprehensively and efficiently as possible."
"Perhaps an alternative solution could be sought among the other available options."
"We have the Convention on Cybercrime, which proposes ways of striking a reasonable balance between the storage and protection of data, such as the use of a data freeze or a system of data preservation."
"This Convention proposes several solutions that have not yet been implemented in a single country."
"At this point one begins to wonder whether the desire to take rapid action did not triumph over rational reflection in this case, particularly in view of the fact that the Council received its mandate on 25 March of last year, exactly two weeks after the dreadful atrocities in Madrid."
"I hope that the message we are sending out from here will be properly interpreted."
"We are willing to cooperate, but we also want the right procedure to be chosen."
"As the report shows, we believe, and the legal services believe, that this matter should be part of the first pillar of the EU Treaty, in other words one of the areas in which our Parliament engages in joint decision-making and is not merely consulted."
"Perhaps that can be taken on board, and perhaps we shall then be accorded the same level of respect that we give the other institutions in the course of our work."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, in the context of this debate, I should be very interested to learn how sharply the European Union in general and the Council in particular are focusing on the issue of bioterrorism."
"I have no doubt that a good foreign policy which functions properly is the best preventive mechanism."
"This, unfortunately, has not been fully understood by part of the European electorate in recent weeks, and some of the responsibility for that surely lies with us."
"Be that as it may, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we are liable to be confronted with the problem of bioterrorism."
"We hope it will not come to that, but I should like to know from the Commission and the Council how they are preparing for such an eventuality."
"I should also like to know how these preparations have progressed over the past year and over the last few months since the appointment of a common European coordinator."
"If the rumours are true – and I hope they are not – that cooperation has been dreadful in the entire area around my country, I should like to know what steps the Commission and the Council are taking to tackle this issue resolutely."
"There is no doubt that this is a European mission and that the European dimension brings added value."
"I keenly await the Commission’s comments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will address all at the same time the many sensitive issues raised by the rapporteurs, to whom I have listened with great attention and whom I sincerely thank for having drawn attention to matters of exceptional interest for the democratic life of Europe."
"I believe that terrorism is genuinely the new tyranny of the 21st century, a tyranny which seeks to limit our freedoms and to attack people’s fundamental rights – the right to life and physical safety – and I therefore agree with your approach."
"A response is needed that involves European intervention and strong international cooperation."
"It is not a case of an emergency response: we must regard terrorism as a permanent threat, which therefore requires a strategy and, as many have said, concrete action, above all."
"Only last Friday in Luxembourg, the Council, on this basis, endorsed the action plan proposed by the Commission, which contains some new, and in my opinion, effective proposals. These will be implemented as early as in the next few months and will add to the measures already in place."
"As Mr Mayor Oreja correctly stated, we are dealing with aspects of a single strategy, not a list of measures."
"It will be a question of a political plan on which Parliament, the Council and the Commission obviously must and can work together."
"I believe that one of the fundamental principles resides in the fact that the fight against terrorism does not mean restricting people’s freedoms; quite the opposite!"
"The greatest political mistake would be if people’s fundamental freedoms were also to fall victim to terrorism, in the sense of being sacrificed, or, even, wiped out."
"The balance between preventative action and repression, on the one hand, and the safeguarding of fundamental rights and freedoms, on the other, is therefore the focus of all of the reports."
"If I may now make some brief observations on the reports presented."
"Mrs Díez González is certainly right in stressing the importance of an available action plan, allowing us in particular to monitor the actions of the Member States in implementing the measures decided upon."
"It would be truly paradoxical if, after having identified a strategy, there was not a mechanism for overseeing the implementation of the measures outlined in the strategy itself."
"The action plan and its implementation will therefore be a priority for the Commission."
"As many of you are already aware, one of the main elements of the action plan approved on Friday in Luxembourg was precisely the creation of a permanent monitoring instrument."
"The Commission proposes to issue a report periodically – on a six-monthly basis, I believe. It will, of course, be made public and will concern the methods and the quality of implementation of all of the measures by the Member States."
"For instance, with regard to certain points outlined in Mrs Díez González’s report, we are working on a communication on explosives, detonators and firearms, and on a second communication that concerns the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists."
"In addition to these measures, we will clearly and promptly put forward a number of proposals on the issue of the funding of terrorism – I will return to this issue – with particular reference to certain organisations that assist and support terrorism."
"We will obviously work towards the implementation of the ARGUS system, with which many of you will be familiar. I am certain that this system will allow us to create a network of all of the existing rapid response systems within the Commission."
"The aim is to create a European network that will enable the immediate exchange of information – I would say in real time – between all of the Member States in the event of a terrorist attack."
"Mr Mayor Oreja’s report very rightly stresses the importance of strengthening information exchange, cooperation with third countries, dialogue with civil society – which is a fundamental aspect – and assistance and support to the victims of terrorism, which is another aspect on which the Commission will work intensely. I believe that this period of work, which Parliament has begun today with the presentation of the reports, will increasingly have to take into account the victims of terrorism, as well as the perpetrators of terrorist acts, of course."
"I believe that the key to the success of this strategy lies in the principle of inclusiveness: all of the actors in society, both public and private, must be able to participate in the democratic debate on terrorism."
"I believe that providing the public with appropriate information, which is neither threatening nor exaggerated, but is in contrast clear, can be a reassuring response."
"If we tell the citizens that there exist practical measures and that together we are fine-tuning them, I believe that the citizens can feel reassured by the fact that the great institutions of Europe are working, and will continue to work, proactively."
"With regard to the protection of critical infrastructures, I greatly welcomed the report by Mr Lambrinidis."
"Without doubt, one of the principal terrorist threats affects infrastructures, and it is precisely within this sector that cooperation is essential between public institutions, every level of government and the private sector."
"By the end of the year, the Commission aims to present to Parliament a proposal for a European programme for critical infrastructure protection."
"One of the items in the programme relates to the possibility of providing access to immediate and well-timed information – a kind of early warning – in the event of the danger of a terrorist attack."
"I can tell you that an important seminar is taking place in Brussels on this issue as we speak, with 150 representatives of the 25 Member States in attendance."
"This meeting provides a positive response: there is broad consensus on the principle elements of this future programme."
"We will organise a second European public seminar in September in order to then be able to present a tangible programme by the end of the year."
"In this context, we will have a sum of EUR 1.5 million available for studies relating to best practice in the exchange of information among Member States on the security standards for critical infrastructures."
"Each Member State must obviously invest in the structures in place on its own territory."
"With regard to the funding of terrorism, which is the subject addressed in Mr Borghezio’s report, I am in agreement with the main points outlined in the report."
"With reference to the not-for-profit sector, the Commission is working on a kind of European code of conduct with a view to tackling the vulnerability of the sector, which, in certain instances – as has been discovered – directly or indirectly supported terrorist organisations."
"In order to do so, however, we call for large-scale cooperation from the not-for-profit sector itself and from civil society, which is, like us, keen to root out all those who assist terrorist activity in any way."
"In addition, we certainly have in mind a better exchange of information among national authorities with regard to the funding of terrorism."
"We are assessing this issue, and a communication is being prepared by the Commission."
"There is a further, extremely sensitive issue: the traceability of financial transactions."
"It is obvious that, in the absence of the necessary instruments for investigating the trail of financial transactions, we are deprived of an effective instrument for clamping down on terrorist funding."
"With regard to this issue, we therefore aim by this summer to propose to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation on information and the instruments that will be used in tracing financial transactions."
"Then there are the three reports by Mr Duquesne, which touch on a subject which is particularly close to my heart: the link between action against terrorism and personal data protection."
"I believe that the amendments tabled with a view to supplementing and improving the Swedish proposal must be upheld."
"They are amendments that take account of the important conference held a few days ago in Poland, and which highlight the importance of every person’s right to personal data protection, even when we are confronted by terrorism."
"That means establishing a balance: no one can envisage abandoning the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, but individuals’ fundamental rights must be preserved."
"I agree with Mr Duquesne’s thoughts on the role of Europol and Eurojust."
"It is important to allow these bodies access to a wide spectrum of information, so that they may effectively carry out the exchange and coordination work which is the role of Europol, as is evident from the organisation’s new remit, received a few days ago by its new director."
"The principal of respect for fundamental rights is a subject addressed by Mr Alvaro, and it is a subject on which I myself have spoken many times."
"The principle of personal data protection must respond to real needs."
"Personal data cannot be safeguarded if the safeguard does not correspond to established objectives and for a specific period of time, and neither can permission be granted to access those data except to the competent police and investigation authorities that have a right to access them by law."
"We are preparing a provision in this respect, founded on a legal basis which, in my opinion, is more appropriate than the existing one, and which I outlined on Friday to the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. I shall be presenting the actual text by the end of this summer."
"The final subject that I would like to address quickly is bioterrorism."
"The rapporteur is aware that the Commission has some powers, but not all."
"It can take charge of food safety, the trade in medicinal products, coordination between the Member States, civil protection and the funding of research."
"That is no small thing."
"It is the responsibility of the Member States, however, to adopt practical measures for effective preventative action and potential reactive action in the event of a terrorist attack."
"You are aware that, following the 2005 bioterrorist attack using traces of anthrax, a high level committee for public health safety was set up with an effective programme of cooperation for prevention and rapid response."
"The cooperation in progress is working and we are able to tell you that there is a system that can provide a rapid alert in the event of a biological, chemical or radiological attack, 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
"Many steps taken by the Commission will improve the level of preparedness and prevention: we are developing simulation exercises in case of potential bioterrorist attacks, two of which will be performed this year to provide a practical assessment of the standard of prevention and rapid response."
"We are drawing up guidelines, moreover, for managing medical diagnoses in the event of agents being spread by bioterrorists; we are preparing training courses in collaboration with Europol, and we are supporting national emergency plans that aim to make available an adequate number of vaccines and emergency assistance."
"As you are aware, MrKyprianou unveiled an important European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control barely a week ago."
"We will continue to encourage the Member States on these issues."
"There are two final and practical proposals that I would like to point out."
"Firstly, the drafting of a new European programme on health and consumer protection, under which we aim to increase the level of funding allocated to prevention and rapid response in the event of public health emergencies."
"We have also proposed the reimbursement of costs for public health emergencies under the Solidarity Fund, up to a sum of EUR 1 billion."
"Secondly – and this is my final point - I will mention an important initiative that we have identified as a framework programme."
"It is a programme, planned and approved for the next Community budget, which is focused on preparedness and prevention relating to security."
"Obviously, this will include funds to be allocated in the event of potential bioterrorist attacks."
". Mr President, in this very brief speech, I would like to stress the importance of the exchange of information for combating the kind of terrorism we are discussing."
"This is why Mr Duquesne’s report is so appropriate, since it places the emphasis on this extremely important issue."
"We must have the courage to call the organisation we are fighting by its name and there is no question that we are facing a series of fundamentalist groups which do not represent Islam, but which claim to operate in the name of Islam."
"That is why I believe information to be so important, because it is an emerging phenomenon that we have practically no knowledge of, and in the case of this type of phenomenon, information is essential."
"We certainly do not know how they act and above all we do not understand their sense of time."
"They are not like other organisations that have the same sense of time as us."
"That is why it is so important that we be able to work to understand the social support for these organisations, in the knowledge that they are prepared to die, to sacrifice their lives in these attacks, something that does not happen in the case of other kinds of organisation."
"That is why it is so important that we are able to place the emphasis on the exchange of information from national police forces and not just with Europol."
"The European project must have sufficient capacity to promote the exchange of information amongst national police forces, who are the bodies working in particular on this phenomenon."
"The Council, the Commission and this Parliament must therefore create more fora for exchanging information amongst the police forces working on this sensitive and difficult issue."
". One of the greatest and most complex challenges facing liberal democracies is international terrorism."
"Terrorism first and foremost targets our security, but it also fundamentally jeopardises our freedom."
"We must find ways of defending ourselves against terrorism and protecting our security whilst ensuring that our civil and human rights and our freedom do not fall victim as a result."
"Mr Duquesne’s report confronts this dilemma, and I congratulate him on this, because he knows that on the one hand, rapid and effective exchange of information is the key to this whole problem, while at the same time it is precisely due to this exchange of information that concerns arise regarding protection of personal data."
"In this regard, Mr Duquesne makes a very good suggestion – which I support – namely to set up a body to monitor developments throughout the whole process."
"But until we have put these new measures in place, we need to take as our standard, the statutory provisions prevailing in those countries, that provide the strongest protection of their citizens’ personal data."
"For the second time, we propose that countries which are not yet members, but are candidates for membership, should be involved in this exchange of information – at least let us consider their inclusion as an option – in other words, countries that will soon be members of the European family and neighbouring countries that are affected in this regard."
"Finally, we recommend and urge that the Member States of the European Union ratify the various international agreements and treaties relating to combating terrorism as soon as possible."
"Many Member States have unfortunately not yet ratified many of these international agreements and we therefore have no unified means at our disposal to fight terrorism effectively."
". Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in time, combating terrorism, preventing it and wiping it from the face of the Earth must be the sole priority objective of this European Union’s policies."
"We must not forget that on 11 March, Spain and Europe were attacked in a cruel and cowardly fashion because they represent a model of the freedoms that we in this House are always trying to safeguard."
"On that day, 11 March, the history of Spain, the history of Europe, and hence the history of the European Union, changed."
"From that moment, it became necessary to acknowledge that terrorism is not a uniform, homogenous or monolithic reality."
"On the contrary, that attack demonstrated that there are many different types of terrorism; the means for combating those different types of terrorism must not, therefore, be generic, but rather specific and suited to each of them."
"From this point of view, the terrorism of Al Qaeda cannot be fought in the same way as the terrorism of ETA or that of the IRA. And it cannot, of course, be combated if we deny its existence, as some Members here in the European Parliament want to do, by removing any mention of Al Qaeda from our anti-terrorist documents."
"If I have learnt one lesson from history, it is that if we ignore it, we are doomed to repeat it."
"If this fight is to be effective, we must base our efforts on prevention mechanisms, and I entirely agree with the Commissioner."
"The fight must not be based exclusively on reaction mechanisms; the best way to combat terrorism is to prevent it."
"I entirely agree with Mr Mayor Oreja when he says that prevention must be based on the rapid and bilateral exchange of information amongst the specialised services of the Member States, on facilitating the systematic transmission of information to Europol and Eurojust and on the creation of registers, such as the register of European criminals, to facilitate investigations."
"No difficulty must hinder the effective protection of freedom and the right to life."
"The defence of life and of freedom must always be our priorities in this fight."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I drafted the opinion on data retention for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and I should also like to restrict myself to that subject."
"Before I begin, however, let me thank the rapporteur and everyone else who was involved for their work."
"It is surely incontestable that the democracies of the European Union must face up to the threat from crime and terrorism and engage in the effort to defeat them."
"The Commission’s proposal on the retention of stored and processed data could contribute to the pursuit of that aim, but not in its present form."
"The proposal for a framework decision has rightly come under heavy cross-party fire in this House."
"Allow me to highlight a few of the issues."
"The proposal fails to answer the key question of the extent to which the retention of data is actually necessary and expedient."
"Regrettably, it contains no plausible evidence that the proposed measures will actually serve to improve our collective ability to fight crime and terrorism."
"Without this evidence, however, it is absolutely impossible to justify the profound effects of this type of data storage on people and businesses."
"I know that the Commission is currently working on a proposal of its own."
"However, I ask the Commission – and indeed I personally wrote to Commissioner Frattini on this matter – to have an independent impact assessment conducted with a view to ascertaining whether the benefits of the planned measures justify their cost."
"Let me also add a few words on the current process."
"As far as the procedural provisions are concerned, I should have liked to see a different form of parliamentary involvement in this sensitive matter."
"Data protection, which truly affects every individual and every business, demands a proper legislative process."
"Under the EC Treaty, this includes the full participation of the European Parliament."
"All of which leads me to conclude that the proposal for a framework directive must be thoroughly overhauled in the light of the criticisms voiced by the European Parliament."
". Mr President, this is a very important debate and I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, in particular my colleagues Mr Mayor Oreja and Mrs Díez González, on their reports."
"The report by Mrs Díez González, in particular, is highly ambitious and is intended to provide the citizens with a very high level of protection against terrorism."
"I believe that one of the achievements of the modern State has been the protection of citizens against crime of all kinds."
"We are currently facing a very specialised kind of crime, terrorism, and this requires action not just by State institutions, but also cooperation in the international field."
"As far as we are concerned, we believe that cooperation within the framework of the European institutions is fundamental and, in this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the swift ratification of the European Constitution to the citizens of Europe, since it establishes a framework for fighting terrorism that begins with the recognition of peoples’ right to life and to physical integrity, as a fundamental right, and goes on to enshrine an area of freedom, security and justice."
"These texts should be read it appears that some citizens of the Union do not know them yet."
"The Solidarity clause in Article I-43 of the European Constitution states that ‘The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the victim of terrorist attack or natural or man-made disaster.’"
"It then says, ‘The Union shall mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including the military resources made available by the Member States, to:"
"a) prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States,"
"protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack,"
"assist a Member State in its territory at the request of its political authorities in the event of a terrorist attack;"
"b) assist a Member State in its territory at the request of its political authorities in the event of a disaster.’"
"Furthermore, the European Constitution establishes a mechanism for cooperation amongst the Member States."
"My conclusion, therefore, Mr President, is that the citizens of Europe currently expect us, the European politicians, to promote the process of ratifying the European Constitution so that we may soon have the appropriate instruments for fighting this scourge."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the six rapporteurs, who have carried out some very complicated work on the difficult job of combating terrorism, of drawing up a common assessment with a view to combating terrorism on the basis of legality, respect for human rights and data protection."
"I would like to congratulate, by name, Rosa Díez, Jaime Mayor, Stavros Lambrinidis, Antoine Duquesne, Mario Borghezio and Alexander Nuno Alvaro."
"My speech relates to a documented commitment, a modest but thoroughly documented commitment, in the fight against terrorism and support and protection for its victims."
"Mr President, the victims must be heard, they must be respected and they must be protected, and the resources must be provided for doing all of this."
"There can be no concessions for terrorism."
"Terrorist crimes can never be justified and they must be pursued in every part of the world."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, inspired by my commitment to the victims, I have presented an amendment to Mr Borghezio’s report: Amendment 4, which relates to forms of terrorist funding."
"In my country we have the so-called ‘revolutionary tax’ which is demanded by the terrorist organisation ETA."
"It is the worst form of extortion in the European Union; it is a form of extortion that consists of writing to Basque businesspeople and asking them to fund its criminal activities."
"It is estimated that this funding amounts to some EUR 12 to 15 million per year."
"If this funding is cut off and made impossible, the terrorist group could not survive."
"There are three types of reaction to this phenomenon: there are those who pay, there are those who leave the country and there are those who do not pay but who then pay a very heavy price for not doing so."
"The National High Court has the legislation and processes in place for these crimes."
"I am therefore appealing in particular this morning to Mrs Roure to take account of what I am saying, because the support of the second largest group in the House and the other groups here is very important."
"I would ask you affectionately to accept and support this amendment, and to support an amendment using other more acceptable terms, such as ‘form of extortion that the terrorist organisation ETA calls a revolutionary tax’, for example, since I am talking about solidarity with the Basque and Spanish businesspeople suffering from this type of extortion."
"Finally, Mr President, and I will end here, I would like to address Mr Gijs de Vries: the threat persists."
"And Mr de Vries, who knows that the threat persists, must have sufficient resources not just to produce strategic reports, but also to run an office that can fight terrorism effectively."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteurs and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have made a particularly important contribution to this work and to this debate."
"We need to demonstrate our determination by agreeing a united response as regards the fight against terrorism, because terrorist organisations have no respect for national frontiers when they commit their crimes."
"That is why, for us, the only effective response to terrorism is a response at European level."
"The European Action Plan against terrorism must be the Union’s basic political tool in this area."
"We accordingly need to be ambitious in identifying specific responses to the problems which lie behind terrorism and fundamentalism."
"Having said that, we cannot limit ourselves solely to security policy, because terrorism amounts to a denial of our citizens’ freedoms."
"That is why we should first and foremost counter terrorism by protecting and actively promoting fundamental rights."
"This priority under the Hague programme should also be at the heart of our policy."
"We must promote the values of democracy and solidarity if we are to combat the causes of terrorism."
"We must confront situations of extreme poverty and social exclusion, which all too often provide a breeding ground for extremist views."
"Within the Union, we must fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia."
"By the same token, however, it would be unacceptable for the fight against terrorism to favour new forms of discrimination."
"We also need to find a way of coordinating the European Union’s internal and external policies for combating terrorism."
"We need to encourage dialogue with non-Member States, particularly with a view to stimulating codevelopment."
"No one should be pushed to take desperate measures because of their precarious situation."
"Furthermore, there is no doubt that transport security has an important part to play in the fight against terrorism, but it must be achieved while respecting our citizens’ right to privacy and protection of their personal data."
"In the light of that, we must pursue our work to adopt appropriate legislative and operational measures including the European arrest warrant, which is a fundamental instrument."
"The third money laundering directive, which also covers the financing of terrorism, will also provide us with means of combating networks supporting terrorism."
"We are therefore calling for Europol and Eurojust to be strengthened, so that they can genuinely coordinate the fight against terrorism and organised crime in Europe."
"Nevertheless, we also have to give the public guarantees about the protection of their private life."
"That will only be possible if data retention is provided for as an instrument under the first pillar, so as to ensure the protection of personal data."
"Unfortunately, this process has been slowed down by a lack of political will on the part of the Member States to make European decisions truly effective."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to say that reason has always been a victim of hatred, violence and fear."
"We are living in an era of fundamentalism, accompanied by fanaticism and terrorism."
"The world seems to have become politically and economically inflamed, and it is vital for us in the Union to create renewed confidence in democracy and to fight against all those instances of injustice that provide a breeding ground for violence."
". Mr President, I am not sure whether I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or on my own behalf — I rather believe I am speaking on my own behalf."
"In any event, it is clear that this is an important debate."
"Several reports are being presented to this House today, each of which has followed its own course through the committee stage, and, together, they demonstrate very clearly the importance that this Parliament attaches to this debate."
"The rapporteurs for these reports deserve our congratulations and we should also be pleased that they have appreciated the need to accept many amendments that have improved them and have clarified some of the statements contained in the original texts, in some cases in a very significant manner."
"In any event, today this Parliament will make very clear its commitment to an extremely vigorous fight against terrorism in terms of policing, in terms of judicial efficiency, but one that, at the same time, is extremely respectful of human rights, of data protection, of the guarantees without which this fight against terrorism makes no sense, a fight that takes account of the victims of terrorism, on the basis of respect — it naturally does not put political decisions into their hands, that would not be appropriate, but it is logical that they should have a voice and be heard directly — and which, without justifying terrorism nor those who sacrifice themselves or are capable of indiscriminate murder in any way, without justifying it under any circumstances, it is an anti-terrorist policy that deals with the possible reasons why somebody may become a terrorist."
"We cannot look at terrorism as if it had just landed from Mars."
"There are situations which lead to people being prepared to kill, and that does not excuse the individuals who do so, but it does oblige us, as politicians, to examine why and which specific situations lie behind this behaviour."
"The balance, therefore, between this vigorous fight, this examination of the reality as it stands, and respect for human rights, is actually a real balance which, if translated from these reports into political action, could have significant results."
"Some amendments remain alive, and some of them I presented myself on behalf of my group — in this case, it was on behalf of my group. I would like to highlight two of them."
"Firstly, we are talking about terrorism from many sources and, therefore, to mention Islam, even if we only say, ‘We believe that Islam is fundamentally fine, but we are worried about Islamic terrorists’, would be to mix terrorism with Islam."
"We therefore propose the removal of any reference to Islam in this document, because otherwise we could be producing a list of those who are potential terrorists."
"We have not done that, and it would be very dangerous to do so because we would always leave somebody out."
"Let us not, therefore, mix up terrorism and Islam, even if that only means introducing a clause stating that ‘Islam is fundamentally okay’, which is what these reports apparently intend to do unless this amendment is approved."
"Secondly, we propose the removal of any reference to the International Criminal Court."
"We believe that this court is only now beginning its work, and to complicate its operation through a debate on its powers in the anti-terrorist field would only jeopardise its operation."
"Let us, therefore, leave that debate out of the issue we are dealing with today. There are other ways to deal with it, and today we should be dealing with what is already operational."
"Finally, I would like to say to Mr Gijs de Vries, who is honouring us with his presence today, that the important thing is to turn all of this into political action and concrete measures."
". Mr President, with seven reports today, this Parliament is trying to arrive at a comprehensive common position on terrorism and to organise the fight against that terrorism."
"This is a monumental task that we are undertaking."
"Allow me to specify what it entails."
"The task is to win a struggle against adversaries who cast aside all human qualities, break every rule and every law, disregard national and moral boundaries, know no restraint and fanatically pursue the criminal aim of abolishing human freedom."
"Our goal is to win this war without sacrificing our own decency, casting aside our humanity, betraying our own laws or endangering personal freedom within our own domestic territory."
"That is the task, and it is incredibly difficult."
"Even for war, common rules have been developed over the centuries, but here we are faced with adversaries lurking in the shadows, imperceptible and transcending all borders."
"This makes firm resolve and a common approach essential, but it also requires us to realise that we must not let our sensitivity to our own people’s needs and rights be deadened at the sound of the word ‘terrorism’ or give for the use of any and every instrument in the war on terrorism."
"Mr Alvaro, one of the rapporteurs, raised this point."
"I believe it is particularly important to emphasise that fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law do not seem to be adequately protected by the provisions of this draft."
"There is another aspect, however, that confronts us with an entirely new situation."
"The whole González report is based on the assumption that the European Constitution will enter into force."
"It builds on the foundations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, parliamentary codecision, open legislative processes, the solidarity clause, the right to determine the disclosure and use of one’s own personal data, parliamentary scrutiny, judicial review and the dissolution of the pillar structure in favour of a unified Europe."
"This is not wishful thinking or a dream that may be set to crumble before our eyes."
"No, it is an absolute, imperative and indispensable prerequisite for this package of measures and its legitimacy and for the defence of fundamental rights."
"Without this prerequisite, without the European Constitution, we are in no position to approve this catalogue of measures, because there is no guarantee that the balance between justice, security and freedom will be preserved."
"Add to this the fact that, on the issue of converting Europol into an agency and of transferring the Counter-terrorism Coordinator to the staff of the Commission, there is still no more on the table than our request – no consent, no explanation – and it becomes clear that we run the risk of upsetting the balance here and jeopardising our citizens’ freedom."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first sentence in the strategic document on national defence approved by the United States in March 2005 states: the United States and the world are fighting a war."
"That is the ideological premise that has given rise in recent years to the theory of preventative war, the violation of individual freedoms, the end of personal data protection, and the fixation on security."
"Terrorism is an extremely serious crime that must be condemned and combated."
"It cannot be combated by military means, however, and I believe, therefore, that Europe must distance itself from that approach."
"We must carefully analyse the spiral of war and terrorism, because the military response has strengthened terrorism, and we cannot sidestep this issue."
"In Afghanistan, the military occupation has generated exponential growth in the production of opium, which is funding the al-Qa’ida network."
"In Iraq, the war has boosted the strength of terrorist groups, not all of which are religiously motivated, and that is the reason why we need to remove the anti-Islam fixation from some of the reports being examined in this House."
"Such a fixation also reveals a cultural subordination to the United States."
"President Bush has, in fact, asked Islamic regimes to limit, control and record all charitable donations made by Muslims."
"We, however, cannot look upon not-for-profit organisations as the main source of terrorist funding, as do some of the rapporteurs in this House."
"We must avoid making overly simplistic equations along the lines of terrorism equals immigration, or terrorism equals Islam."
"Terrorism must be combated and defeated: the aim is noble, but the methods are all too often improper and sometimes criminal."
"Terrorism is a crime against humanity, but I do not believe that it is necessary to single out an International Criminal Court as the place for trying such crimes, partly because at the same time it is unacceptable that nobody judges the massacres of civilians during military actions."
"All too often sovereignty relieves the prince of criminal liability."
"An influential expert in law once said that the legal history of the Western State is that of instilling the notion of its innocence in criminal acts."
"I believe that in order to combat terrorism, we must re-examine the old legal proverb that says that the king is never wrong."
"Mr President, in this debate on terrorism I welcome the fact that last Saturday morning, in Belfast, an IRA member, Terry Davison, was charged in court with the murder of Robert McCartney and that a second IRA person, Jim McCormick, was charged with the attempted murder of Mr McCartney's friend, Brendan Devine."
"I should like to congratulate the police service of Northern Ireland on overcoming an IRA-orchestrated and ongoing campaign of intimidation to begin the process of securing justice in this notorious case."
"I trust that many more charges will follow, for that is the only way to deal with the processes of terrorism."
"The mission of democracies must be to defeat terrorism, not merely to contain or to tame it."
"'Softly, softly' conciliation is merely banked by the terrorists, who then demand more and more."
"We have lived through that in Northern Ireland: our government foolishly tolerated 'no go' areas for their own security forces, an acceptable level of violence, political status for prisoners, secret talks, side deals, the restructuring and renaming of the police, the soft-pedalling of paramilitary organised crime, and the ultimate ignominy of the early release of terrorists under the ill-conceived Belfast Agreement."
"None of it worked, because the latest International Monitoring Committee report shows that we still have a functioning, recruiting, training, threatening and active IRA that works hand-in-glove with its junior partner, Sinn Féin, whose members, as ever, are notably absent when we debate terrorism in this House."
"I implore the rest of Europe to learn the lessons."
"Be quicker in learning than the British Government was, and learn the lesson that terrorism cannot be tamed or sanitised but must be resolutely defeated and driven out of business, including all its sidelines of criminality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the six rapporteurs for their reports."
"As shadow rapporteur for my group, I have tried to make a positive contribution to the Borghezio report to help combat the financing of terrorism."
"It is evident from all interventions that there is general agreement on the need for coordinated action to combat internationally organised crime and the means by which it is financed."
"The public expects a powerful European response."
"After all, the benefit of European cooperation in this respect is beyond dispute."
"Tracing and combating the financing of terrorist networks and/or attacks is not an easy task because it is often small amounts that are involved."
"Apart from the abuses via the regular financial sector, it is mainly charities that are the favourite hunting ground for international terrorists."
"Accordingly, recent Belgian police statistics show that an increasing number of non-profit organisations are taken advantage of for criminal activities."
"Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, everyone was suddenly given a wake-up call, and no fewer than 86 dossiers were opened in our country."
"The organisations involved all state that they do charitable work, but their only , though, is the collection and channelling of funds for the benefit of terrorist organisations."
"Such statistics, but also the result of the enquiry into the murder of Theo van Gogh in the Netherlands, for example, demonstrate that we must, as a matter of urgency, adopt preventive policies based on the exchange of information, better traceability of financial transactions and greater transparency of legal entities."
"That is why the specific recommendations in this report, including the setting up of common frameworks for transnational investigations, developing a network for the structured exchange of information, improving cooperation with SUSTRANS and the drafting of minimum standards for the verification of customers’ identities, receive our support."
"Finally, we also want to provide charities with the necessary funds to guarantee a more effective protection against abuse by terrorist organisations."
"We therefore hope that this report can give the initial impetus for combating the financing of terrorism in the European Union in a structural and sustainable manner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree that we must take resolute action against international terrorism and organised crime."
"Today, however, I should like to re-emphasise that we must adopt the right measures."
"In my opinion and in the view of my group, the proposal on the retention of stored and processed data is not the right tool for the job."
"We made this abundantly clear with our vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Let me also make a point of congratulating my honourable colleague Mr Alvaro on his report."
"The protection of individuals’ personal data is not guaranteed by the Council’s proposal."
"It would impose huge costs on the European telecommunications industry, and the benefits of storage are not sufficiently commensurate with the effort involved."
"There are too many opportunities for circumvention against which the Council’s proposal offers no safeguards."
"What about flat-rate contracts and the use of foreign mobiles from Brazil or Asia, for example?"
"Even the BDK, the trade union representing Germany’s criminal police, has emphasised that it is the quality of data which is crucial, not necessarily the quantity or the retention period."
"What we have in this case is a knee-jerk reaction, which merely creates the illusion of greater security."
"We surely cannot seriously intend to store data on more than four million people generated by the use of the Internet, telephone calls and text messages."
"If in doubt, we need only look across the ocean to the country that very often exceeds the bounds of reason in its anti-terrorism measures."
"The US Congress rejected a similar bill on the retention of stored and processed data on the grounds – believe it or not – that the proposed measures went too far."
"Instead, an agreement was reached on the ‘quick freeze’ mechanism, which is perhaps a suitable solution."
"Why can the same thing not happen in Europe?"
"The German Bundestag has rejected the Council’s proposal."
"Finland has also warned against data retention."
"What really riles me and puts me in a veritable lather is the news that the European Ministers of Justice plan to go against the recommendation of our committee and implement the Council’s plans for the retention of data come what may, without parliamentary codecision."
"In the light of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, it beggars belief that any attempt can be made to squeeze Parliament out of the decision-making process."
"Such a move is downright dangerous."
"We are not talking here about a single measure to combat terrorism but about public protection and the rights of every individual in this European Union."
"For the Council to say in this context that it will decide unilaterally as it always has done will not bring the European Union any further forward."
"The fact is that much of what has gone awry in the European Union and has shaken many people’s belief in the Union is due to the policies, often driven by self-interest, pursued by ministers of the national governments."
"Mr President, let me begin by commenting on EU action on justice and home affairs."
"Criticism of the Hague Programme for placing undue emphasis on security considerations at the expense of respect for fundamental rights is justified."
"It is not the remark of some left-wing agitator, but a sober assessment by the upper chamber of the British Parliament – the respectable House of Lords."
"Of course, threats to our security are threats to our freedom, but the reverse is also true."
"Undue infringements of our civil liberties make us less secure as individuals."
"I fully support the work of the last four years to ensure that our law enforcement agencies shed their insular and bureaucratic habits, and that our legal and judicial systems are enabled to interact, so that terrorist suspects cannot slip through the cracks."
"But in the words of the European data protection supervisors meeting a few weeks ago: ""Terrorism is used as a justification for new initiatives, many of which deal with a range of offences, some of which are significantly less serious."
"It is important to recognise that derogations from fundamental rights that might be justified to tackle terrorism, will not necessarily be justified where other criminal or activity is concerned."""
"They look forward, as I do, to implementation of the suggestion, made by Commissioner Fratini when addressing a meeting of the Joint Supervisory Authorities, that the Commission would consider an assessment of proportionality of any measures to be introduced in future, examining the impact of the proposal on fundamental rights including the question of personal data protection."
"Regarding exchange of information, the guiding norm adopted in the Hague Programme is the principle of availability."
"That is entirely reasonable, as long as it means ending the kind of inexcusable turf wars and jealousies between agencies that prevent cooperation, but clearly it must not be misinterpreted to mean the abandonment of strict controls over retention, transfer and access to personal information."
"I am concerned about the potential for profiling people as potential terrorists on the basis of their race, religion or political opinions."
"The data protection supervisors are firm that the processing of such data should normally be prohibited."
"The other area where serious concern exists is in respect of the rights of terrorist suspects."
"The Council of Europe guidelines on detaining suspects without fair trial have certainly been breached in the United Kingdom and probably in other EU countries."
"There has been a slide towards relying on evidence extracted under torture and rendition to those countries in breach of the ban on ."
"Member States conduct peer review of each other's anti-terrorism and security measures, but they still have not managed to make all Member States even implement the 2002 framework decision on terrorism – the very law which makes it obligatory to criminalise terrorism."
"While it remains the case that Member States are not implementing their laws, I really find it unacceptable that we should continue to infringe personal liberties."
"Mr President, we are on the horns of a difficult dilemma, and in what we might call a chicken and egg situation; should we have sorted out democracy and put democratic and judicial controls in place, or should effective decision-making come first in order to bring about mass public support for a European democracy?"
"The answer is, of course, that we need both."
"As Mr Oreja has already said, terrorism and the fight against it are outstanding examples of transnational issues, and that is why we should work together more effectively."
"That is easier said than done, though, for 25 countries have 25 veto rights."
"Decisions are drawn out, resulting in woolly compromises or, quite simply, in no action being taken at all."
"In my view, countries should now jump over their own shadows."
"At the same time, we should also acknowledge that the Council has to take decisions on very sensitive matters, which have an impact on civil rights."
"That is another reason why the process of reaching them should be shrouded in such secrecy."
"I think that the Council should start having meetings, and voting, in public."
"Neither of these changes would require any change in the treaty."
"It is simply a matter of opening doors."
"I hope that Parliament will take joint action to enter into consultation with the Council on this subject."
"Much has been said about terrorism being an attack on our fundamental freedoms and that we should thus not make the mistake of undermining those same civil rights."
"Privacy is another much-quoted example."
"Privacy is, of course, not sacred , but infringements should always be proportionate, necessary, effective and verifiable."
"Indeed, the proposal to store communications traffic data is therefore outside of all proportion."
"If the Council adopts it, Parliament should go to the Court of Justice."
"Moreover, the Council trying to circumvent democratic control by taking this decision in the third, instead of the first, pillar offers us little comfort."
"For indeed, once again, if we want to protect democracy from terrorism, we should not mess it up in the first place."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports, but when we talk about terrorism, we need to take particular care to present a clear position on the content of the term."
"Indicative of the dangers lying in ambush when we give hazardous definitions is the difficulty being experienced by the international community itself and the UN in making an entirely objective interpretation of terrorism feasible."
"Terrorism is a crime which we condemn unreservedly, provided that the term is not abused in order to prosecute liberating movements and radicalism."
"Unfortunately, the degree of excess in the measures being adopted under the Action Plan allows conservative forces to justify taking measures which do anything but defend a climate of security."
"At the same time, we need to be very careful with regard to the legislative framework into which we are trying fit terrorism, in order to ensure that it will not form the basis for military intervention, which would be contrary to the principles of international law and the founding Charter of the United Nations."
"The plethora of measures taken by the European Union in its fight against terrorism is based mainly on the need for there to be a climate of security."
"This is essentially the priority which has been set."
"The taking of measures which will safeguard the peaceful coexistence of and a sense of security among the citizens of the European Union is not of secondary importance."
"Under no circumstances, however, can they be safeguarded on the basis of the interests of big business, of curbing citizens' consciences and of strengthening the climate of fear and insecurity which is the result of excessive controls on and the reduction of it, for example in the human rights sector."
"The Action Plan responds mainly to a given interpretation of terrorism and does not aim to resolve its deeper causes."
"It responds mainly to existing hegemonic trends and does not address, as we think it should, the underlying cause, which is hunger, poverty, social injustice, the failure to respect civil and national dignity, discrimination, racism, the trampling underfoot of human rights in general and state terrorism."
"Consequently, efforts to strengthen this plan in the direction and towards the objectives which it serves worry us and we consider that it cannot, as it now stands, constitute a solution for the creation of an area of real freedom and security."
"– Mr President, I have been the victim of terrorism."
"At the television station which I manage in Athens, I have been on the receiving end of two bomb attacks."
"The station was burnt to the ground and it is a terrible thing to see people surrounded by flames trying to save themselves."
"I have also been attacked in my home."
"I drive around in an armoured car with security."
"I sleep with an Uzi under my pillow."
"It is terrible to know that you can be attacked at any moment."
"However, we must admit that terrorism has already won its first victories against democracy."
"What are these victories?"
"The television cameras, the telephone tapping, the reductions in human rights and the biometric passports which are entering our lives."
"All these are victories by terrorism, insofar as we are cutting back on democracy."
"People use terrorism in order to impose global control."
"They feed it."
"When we say that terrorists are usually Islamic fundamentalists and then people go and urinate and spit on the Koran, are they not feeding Islamic fundamentalism?"
"We therefore have to look at it from the other side."
"It is no good looking at terrorism from the benches of the European Parliament."
"We need to look at terrorism from inside the caves in Afghanistan and from how someone there sees it, so that we can at some point have a communication code and resolve the issue."
"Why does a millionaire prince not live in the casinos of London, why does he not live in the Bahamas and not in the lap, for example, of beautiful women, but goes to live and die in a cave?"
"We have to see it as it is."
"Is it fanaticism?"
"That is the easy answer."
"But what feeds this fanaticism?"
"Were we always so honest in the past?"
"Did we not have these areas of the planet enslaved for years?"
"Was our ally in the hunt for terrorists not guilty of the worst ethnic cleansing in centuries when it wiped out an entire race, the Red Indians?"
"Did it not base its progress on torturing and enslaving the Negroes?"
"Perhaps we too are not quite so correct?"
"What is our stand today?"
"Do we not have a one-sided stand on the Middle East?"
"What are we going to collect?"
"Now we say that Gaddafi, who brought down a Pan American aeroplane and killed dozens of people, is our friend because he has changed policy; at the same time, however, we hound Castro, who has not brought down any aeroplanes."
"We say that the dictator in Pakistan is good because he is our friend, but we say that another dictator is bad and we wage war on him."
"We therefore need to look at how honest we are on the subject of terrorism."
"We need to look at what is happening."
"We need to keep our ears open, because as long as we keep taking aspirins, we shall continue to have a headache."
"We need to look at what is causing the headache."
"So we need to open our eyes and stop this one-sided policy."
"We need to give more incentives, more opportunities to these nations in order to reduce fundamentalism, in order to reduce terrorism."
"That is the solution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the short space of time that has been allocated to me, I should like to say three things about matters of fundamental importance."
"Firstly, surely it is a crying shame that to date, it is still so awkward and such an uphill struggle to achieve concrete cooperation and exchange of information on combating terrorism, not only between one Member State and another, but also between the European Member States and the other countries of the free west."
"Well-informed eurosceptic though I am, I do believe there cannot, in that area at least, be enough cooperation."
"The fact is that the safety of our citizens is at stake."
"We now know that the 11 September attacks were, at least in part, planned in Hamburg."
"We know that following the Madrid bomb attack, terrorist cells have been exposed across the whole of Europe."
"It is evident that terrorism transcends national borders, and so, then, should the fight against it."
"Secondly, this is no time for a failure of nerve; we have to call a spade a spade."
"Terrorism in Europe has become almost exclusively Islamic."
"American experts are warning us today about the return from Iraq, and other troublespots, of Islamic militants who have, over there, become more radical and have learnt terrorist techniques."
"Intolerant Islam is on the march in Europe, and is very much a breeding ground for terrorism."
"Not every Muslim is a terrorist but nearly every terrorist is a Muslim."
"Thirdly, I would also draw your attention to the fact that for many years now, European aid for the Palestinians is being used, not only to allow Mrs Arafat to lead a life of luxury in Paris, but also to fund terrorism in Israel."
"We cannot combat terrorism in Europe while funding it in Israel."
"If the use of funds in Palestine does not become clearer and more transparent, the supply of them should be suspended."
"– Mr President, we have heard a great many useful views and proposals from the rapporteurs today and I congratulate both them and Vice-President Frattini for the programmes which he has put forward for combating terrorism."
"Terrorism is an abstract term but it has a specific political bedrock."
"Terrorists are specific persons who exist but, at the same time, they are invisible and unseen."
"Consequently, the global strategy against terrorism will only succeed either when we have wiped all – and I mean all – terrorists out, or if the political support on which terrorism is based disappears."
"The first is impossible."
"It is possible to achieve the second."
"As a tactic of war or political tactic, terrorism is the most abominable of phenomena."
"Inhumane terrorist action cannot be legitimised or justified in any way or for any reason."
"However, those who practise barbaric terrorist methods cite some special religious and/or occasionally social cause and they have moral and political support from a number of societies."
"It is to these societies that we need to turn."
"The European Union is in a position to penetrate these societies and act as a catalyst."
"In the case both of the Arabs and in other cases, Europe is not seen as the great big devil or as the people's enemy."
"This is precisely where we need to allocate roles between the European Union and the United States, Russia and other countries involved."
"Together with the condemnatory chatter of the European Union and the escalation of legislative and other measures against terrorism, we need to develop our own communication strategy with the moderate elements in these societies."
"I am sure that, with this strategy, the European Union will be able to pull the rug out from under the terrorists' feet."
"That is the only way that terrorism will disappear rather than diminish, and it is in this direction that the European Union, the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission must turn as one."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for the work that has gone into producing the reports that we are discussing today, which repeatedly stress the fact that upholding and promoting human rights is the most important and best strategy for preventing and fighting terror."
"Commissioner Frattini has indicated that counter-terrorism should, in fact, entail a reinforcement of human rights, and I could not agree more."
"Upholding and promoting such important values as democracy, freedom, pluralism and human dignity is crucial in the fight against terrorism."
"It is beyond dispute that in order to make this really happen, we will need to fundamentally reconsider large sections of our policy, particularly external policy."
"The radicalisation and polarisation that so often both go towards producing terrorism and result from it are at least as great a threat to the European Union as terrorism itself."
"We politicians must be acutely aware of this and try to keep a cool head at all times."
"Rather than stir up fear unnecessarily, we must be realistic and avoid getting drawn into the hysteria that only fuels the tensions on which terrorism feeds."
"In any case, we must not fall into the trap of going along with the bizarre arguments to which terrorists resort in order to justify their disgraceful actions."
"We must take measures which truly enhance the freedom of all citizens and keep well away from measures that only appear to enhance security."
"In that connection, two of the measures discussed at this forum deserve more attention, in my opinion."
"First of all, the idea of penalising terrorism at the International Criminal Court."
"I wonder what specific problem that would solve."
"Must we really treat terrorists as we do ex-dictators like Milosevic?"
"I know this much; the man who murdered Theo van Gogh, a well-known film maker and much-talked about columnist and opinion maker from my country, the Netherlands, would love to be able to use the platform that such a case would afford him."
"I am therefore emphatically opposed to that idea."
"Then there is the storage of communications traffic data, an example of a measure that leads only to false security, if ever there was one."
"I shall not elaborate on it any further, since much has already been said about this."
"It is disproportionate, it restricts our freedom and I think it is this very freedom that we have to promote in the European Union."
"There are risks involved; you can introduce all kinds of restrictions with regard to accessibility to information of that kind, but let us face it, anything that is available on the Internet is universally accessible, no matter how well protected it is, so the risks involved probably outweigh the benefits."
"I do not think we should go ahead with this."
"Instead, as the Internet is indeed developing into by far the best means of communication for people who want to find out about terrorists and recruit them for others, we should get our security services to specialise in Internet participation, in reading and chatting on the Internet, in other words, to actively monitor what happens in that medium."
"That would make a real difference"
"To find out afterwards which websites a person has visited after they have carried out a bomb attack does not strike me as being the best strategy."
"We must prevent those bomb attacks from being carried out in the first place."
"I think that such a measure – the legal basis of which has been discussed here several times and moreover, the way in which this decision has been taken is a blatant violation of democracy – undermines confidence in European democracy, the risks of which have recently made themselves felt in a painful manner."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my regret at the French and the Dutch ‘no’ to the Constitution, because the EU will now have to fight terrorism with one hand tied behind its back."
"The citizens have given a very clear signal in the debate on the referenda."
"I would, therefore, call on the Council to work in the spirit of the Constitution, and that means respecting three key principles."
"The first is democratic control."
"That means that the Council should not ignore and sideline the European Parliament, but should take its recommendations on board, even if it is not yet obliged to."
"The other two aspects mentioned by many colleagues are proportionality and effectiveness."
"Again, in these areas, the Council should think twice about certain measures."
"Its own report on the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism shows that there are considerable gaps in implementation."
"Before adopting new measures we should be looking at implementation."
"In the case of the peer review, for example, only ten out of twenty-five countries have so far submitted their implementation reports!"
"How can we take new steps if we do not even know if the old ones work?"
"I now turn to three specific issues."
"Firstly, data retention."
"A lot has already been said and again I would call on the Council to act in the spirit of the Constitution and not ignore the European Parliament."
"It should also not ignore the signals given by many countries – the example of the United States has already been mentioned."
"But I would add to those examples the case of the Dutch Parliament, which wanted to adopt a similar data retention measure."
"However, once it found out how that would work – or, rather, not work – in practice, the Dutch Parliament reconsidered it, because it realised that the data retention proposal was simply not workable."
"The Council should not ignore this."
"It is regrettable that the Council is not present on this occasion."
"With passenger name records, there have also been several incidents."
"We were promised an evaluation a year after this entered into force."
"I should like to know from the Commission when we can expect the evaluation."
"Thirdly, we would like to know more about the SitCen, the Situation Centre."
"What exactly is it doing, what kind of information does it deal with and will it report to the European Parliament?"
"Finally, I ask the European Parliament to show its colours."
"We have talked a lot today about the protection of personal data and fundamental rights."
"I call on this Parliament to adopt not only all the reports on antiterrorism measures but also the Moraes report on anti-discrimination policies and minority rights, because fundamental rights are for all citizens."
"Mr President, as I see it, the challenge we face is to fight terrorism effectively while fully respecting human rights and basic freedoms."
"As has already been said, we have our hands tied because of the ‘no’ vote here in France, and there is also another major problem or handicap: there is no international definition of terrorism."
"That means that no possible legal remedy exists, and there is no legal certainty, no guarantee and no protection."
"I therefore believe that the European Union should strive towards a properly recognised definition, both for itself and at international level."
"Mr Van Hecke proposed a simple definition: for terrorist, read Muslim."
"President Putin has another definition: terrorist means Chechen."
"The Chinese have other definitions."
"I believe that these incredibly broad, abusive and arbitrary definitions of terrorism mean that we are losing our ability to act effectively in the fight against terrorism."
"I accordingly believe that we, that is to say the European Union, should make a significant effort, as quickly as possible – at the next UN General Assembly, for example – to secure a definition of terrorism, which is vital and which will also facilitate genuine cooperation between states, at European level and also at world level."
"Mr President, allow me to remind the House of the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, one of the fathers of the American Constitution, who said that ’Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety’."
"Since the criminal atrocities in Madrid, we have known that Europe is now a direct target area for international terrorism."
"There can be no doubt that this fact must be taken into account in the formulation of public policy."
"Every form of terrorism is a crime that threatens the very foundations of our democracy, and these crimes must be combated and must have consequences that befit their gravity."
"They must, however, be combated with appropriate instruments and not at the cost of freedom."
"It goes without saying that our national investigating authorities must cooperate more closely."
"At the same time, we must not create a situation in which data and information are collected, linked and exchanged ever more indiscriminately until the transparent citizen emerges at some time in the near future."
"We must not go down the path towards an Orwellian Big Brother state."
"People’s fundamental rights must not be put on the line."
"We need a targeted policy involving, on the one hand, zero tolerance of terrorism in any shape or form and, on the other hand, a sharp focus on the aim of eradicating the various causes of terrorism."
"This is the only way of ultimately cutting off its supply line."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, terrorism is not a new phenomenon, but the tragic events of recent years have demonstrated its destructive power."
"The fight against terrorism is one of the biggest challenges that we face in the 21st century."
"I commend all of the rapporteurs for their efforts and their work on this dossier."
"It does not matter how terrorism occurs, where it occurs, who the perpetrators are, the justifications they put forward or the causes they fight for."
"All terrorist acts, methods or practices are politically and morally unjustifiable, and must be unequivocally condemned and staunchly combated."
"The tragic events of 11 March in Madrid led the Union to question the effectiveness of its instruments and policies, and illustrated the urgent need for a fresh, dynamic, systematic and effective approach."
"It was in this context that the post of EU coordinator in the fight against terrorism was created, and I should like to welcome Mr De Vries, who is in the House today."
"I support a clear strategy in the fight against terrorism aimed at striking a balance between collective security and individual freedom. This involves, firstly, stepping up the EU’s prevention strategy, preparedness and ability to respond."
"There has been a significant increase in sources of financing."
"The warning system relating to the trade in goods and the provision of services must be improved, in order to provide better monitoring of suspected movements, without disrupting the normal dynamics of the market."
"At the same, public and private institutions, particularly in the banking sector, must work together more closely."
"Thirdly, there must be increased capacity in the area of information, including the essential improvement in the exchange of information with Europol, prevention and consequence management and critical infrastructure protection in the fight against terrorism, which entails drawing up more stringent rules on security and showing solidarity with any Member State that falls victim to a terrorist attack."
"Lastly, I turn to the extremely important question of solidarity with the victims of terrorism."
"When innocent people are murdered, abducted or tortured, or subjected to extortion, blackmail or threats, they are not the only ones who suffer; all of their family Members, their friends and their community as a whole suffer with them."
"Mr President, terrorism is a deadly disease that became a global epidemic at the turn of this century."
"We are now living in a world of two extremes, and by this I mean not only a world of poverty and wealth, but also a world of good and evil."
"The good is represented by public security, and the evil by terrorism."
"We have learned to carry out scientific research into terrorism, to identify its different forms and to look in detail at its causes."
"We have also grown accustomed to referring to state terrorism, individual terrorism, global terrorism, local terrorism and fundamentalism."
"Nevertheless, the simple truth is that there is only one kind of terrorism, namely when one person perpetrates inconceivable evil against another."
"One of the European Union’s basic duties, and one which is enshrined in Article 29 of the Treaty of Maastricht, is to provide its citizens with a high level of safety."
"The questions we should be asking ourselves are whether it is succeeding in doing so, and whether our citizens feel safe."
"The likely answer to the second of these questions is that they do not always feel safe, because we are all aware of what happened on 11 March in Madrid, and of a great many similar incidents."
"Criminals exploit the benefits of integration by moving about freely within the EU, where there are no internal borders."
"They frequently go unpunished, since the EU has 25 different legal and penal systems."
"In order to stop this happening, the EU must develop new and more effective instruments."
"The anti-terrorist package under debate today is intended to help us to do just that."
"I am glad to see that as well as anti-terror proposals, the package also calls urgently for human rights to be protected."
"Consideration is given to all previous regulations and measures, from TREVI in 1975 to the Hague Programme, via Vienna, Tampere and the action plan adopted following 11 September 2001."
"These measures have resulted in the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the establishment of Eurojust and the appointment of an EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator."
"If we wish to achieve results, however, the EU must do more than merely making constant and systematic improvements to the instruments it uses in the fight against terrorism."
"New measures that involve closer cooperation are needed in order to find a solution to what is known as megaterrorism, or in other words terrorism using weapons of mass destruction."
"We must move faster than terrorists and anticipate their actions, rather than waiting for attacks and then dealing with their impact."
"We must take speedier and more effective action, and terrorists must be aware of this and feel its effects."
"Closer cooperation at international level will be needed, together with implementation of the provisions of Article 43 of the European Constitution, or in other words of the solidarity clause that is of such significance for us."
"Finally, I should like to say that as a Pole, I am extremely proud that it is Poland that has been entrusted with the task of protecting the EU’s external borders."
"By doing so, we will be able to make our own contribution to the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the fight against terrorism it is important both to combine forces at national level and at the same time enhance cooperation between the institutions of the Union."
"It is not enough to react to terrorism with the police and intelligence services working closely together, although they are, of course, crucially important."
"The fight against terrorism is fundamentally linked to measures that already help to reduce our society’s vulnerability."
"An example might be ensuring the security of industrial activity and effective cooperation and exchange of information in the emergency services."
"Acts of terror are tragic and, as their name suggests, they are designed to spread fear and panic."
"For that reason, European societies have to be made stronger from within, in terms of their structures and culture in relation to action, and become societies where there is less potential for terrorism."
"Administrative transparency and the awareness of citizens of their environment, including its risks, are of central importance."
"We must also be able to act correctly and effectively in emergency situations."
"The vulnerability of the infrastructure needs to be lessened through determined action, and the exchange of information within the administrative sectors regarding evident risks needs to be increased."
"It is vitally important that research in the EU is developed in the appropriate manner to support the fight against terrorism."
"We must ensure that the Union’s research efforts in the area of internal and external security are sufficiently in dialogue with one another."
"Effective counter-terrorism measures can only be successful when they combine the best European expertise, research into the defence and the emergency service sectors, and other security-related research."
"– Mr President, the Council decisions and the reports which we are debating today are endeavouring, on the pretext of combating terrorism, to achieve, firstly, the creation and application of a more autocratic institutional framework and the creation and strengthening of new repressive mechanisms, monitoring systems etc., the real objective of which is not the fight against this terrorism you are talking about, but the rising grass-roots movement and the peoples' fight against the new imperialist order."
"Secondly, they are endeavouring, by adopting preventive war against terrorism, to prepare the people to accept new interventions and wars."
"It is telling that not one report denounces – on the contrary they exonerate – the state terrorist action of the United States and other countries in Afghanistan and Iraq, Israeli terrorism in Palestine etc."
"In truth, we ask you: is the slaughter of 100 000 civilians in Fallujah in one week by the American militia terrorism or is it not?"
"Finally, the Council's decision last November and the Oreja report introduce the position that radical movements or extreme ideologies are a source of terrorism and this means that social movements and grass-roots rights qualify as terrorism."
"What we note is that you are frightened of the rising grass-roots fights which have emerged ..."
"– Mr President, the commitment by all of us to combat all forms of terrorism is non-negotiable and constant and is also one of the priorities of the Hague programme."
"However, in order for terrorism to be prevented and combated effectively, there needs to be systematic cooperation between the Member States at legislative level and the level of information exchange, in blocking financing and in protecting international transport."
"Finally, there needs to be a detailed and ceaseless preventive policy and the European Union now needs to act proactively and not simply react to tragic incidents."
"The first weapon against terrorism is information."
"As terrorism is now an international phenomenon and operates on an international scale, we need collection and exchange of information at international level and better assessment of threats, taking account always of the need to respect privacy and to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms which are elements of our civilisation."
"The reports by all the rapporteurs, through various points of view, converge in common findings with which I fully agree."
"However, I believe that the existence of numerous texts, not only of these eight reports being debated today, but of all the others which have been adopted from time to time, is creating the risk of confusion and inefficacy."
"I should like to propose to the Commissioner here present, Mr Frattini, that the competent Commission services proceed to codify all the relevant texts."
"I am certain that this would also result in the simplification and systemisation of and in cohesion between the texts."
"Otherwise there is confusion and confusion must be avoided."
"Confusion does not create the preconditions for the proper combating of terrorism."
"Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I really only wish to refer to one point, which relates to the announcement at the very end of your speech, Commissioner, that you intend to conduct two simulations in the near future."
"May I ask you to inform Parliament of these in good time, because it is very important that we should cooperate in this matter."
"Together with my honourable colleague Jerzy Buzek, I myself took part in a simulation exercise in Washington on 14 January."
"That was Exercise Atlantic Storm, which was devoted to bioterrorism."
"We then discussed the subject again in the framework of the New Defence Agenda in Brussels on 25 April."
"We identified three main points, which we simply must spend more time discussing."
"The first point was our realisation that cooperation must become far more intensive than we are used to at the present time."
"This relates both to cooperation among the Member States and to Europe’s cooperation with the United States and with other relevant countries that ought to be involved."
"This cooperation is extremely important, but at the present time it is still very sporadic in some cases."
"It is not conducted systematically either, nor does its methodology give us any real cause for satisfaction with the present system."
"It is not reliable, nor is it transparent, either in general terms or in relation to Parliament, and transparency is crucial if the defects of the system are to be identified and corrected."
"That is one point."
"The second inadequacy is in the field of prevention."
"With specific reference to bioterrorism, I should like to ask you how far we have actually progressed to date on prevention with regard to vaccines."
"In our simulation in Washington, we established that the availability of vaccines varies considerably between Member States of the EU."
"This will be a source of conflicts, Commissioner, in the event of an attack, which we hope will not happen."
"I should like to ask you to comment again on that point."
"The last point I wish to mention relates to an entirely different aspect of this issue."
"In our debates we should always take great care to distinguish between Islamic fundamentalists and Islam in general."
"That would contribute greatly to our political discussion."
"Mr President, I wish to begin with a personal remark addressed to Commissioner Frattini."
"I should like to thank him for his work, as the Foreign Minister of Italy, in the Constitutional IGC during the second half of 2003."
"At that time I was a civil servant in the Finnish delegation."
"He did an excellent job, not least in communitarising justice and home affairs, and that is why I hope we will get this Constitution through."
"I have five very brief points."
"Firstly, there is a very close balance between individual liberty and security and we have to be very careful when we deal with it in relation to terrorism."
"That is why I reject the initiative on retention of data and support the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"My second point is that the fight against terrorism is really an area where the European Union has value added; it is an area where the Member States cannot and will not be able to operate alone."
"My third point is that it is also an area where action is demanded."
"If we look at any Eurobarometer opinion polls, we see that this is an area where the European Union can work quite well."
"My fourth point is that this could also be our next success story, but it all depends on whether we are able to implement it."
"That is why I call upon the Commission to push very hard both for the Tampere Agenda and now The Hague Agenda and get the Member States to implement measures to continue the fight against terrorism."
"My final and fifth point concerns the Constitution."
"Article 43 of the Constitution is a key article."
"It is the one that deals with solidarity."
"If one Member State is faced with a terrorist attack, all the other Member States are required to help out."
"That solidarity clause, though not yet implemented, worked rather well in the face of the Madrid attacks."
"I would really like the Member States and the Commission to stick to that principle."
"I wish to address my remarks to Commissioner Frattini, who gave a very good introduction to this debate."
"His approach to the matter is entirely correct, but it has one fatal flaw."
"I refer to the fact that the preparations he outlined are for a war that has already taken place."
"What is needed above all else in the war against terrorism is imagination, and indeed great feats of imagination, because terrorists are certainly not lacking in the latter."
"I should like to give the Commissioner a few pointers on how to be more imaginative."
"I would like him to answer the following questions."
"If a passenger on board an aeroplane were found to be suffering from an infectious disease, for example smallpox or any other disease, where would the aeroplane land?"
"Have any airports in the Member States been designated for such purposes?"
"What procedures are followed if a pathogen is found that is capable of human-to-human transmission?"
"What procedures are followed if a pathogen is found that is not capable of human-to-human transmission?"
"When asking these and similar questions, we must remember that this is a conflict of the future."
"Bioterrorism is a weapon that requires us to use our imagination."
"I am counting on the EU to play an organisational role in consolidating the efforts of states and nations."
"The second and final point I should like to make is that the Members of this House have been very vocal in condemning terrorism during today’s debate."
"I wonder what name should be given to an institution that makes it technically possible for a television channel owned by a Middle Eastern terrorist organisation to broadcast."
"Can such an institution be said to support terrorism or not?"
"We must ask ourselves whether financial and media bodies are not in fact playing a background role and creating the conditions that make it possible for terrorism to spread, and indeed to spread rapidly."
"While all this is going on, Parliament is happy to sit back and condemn terrorism."
"Mr President, terrorism threatens all of us."
"The United Kingdom has had to deal with the Irish Republican terrorism of Sinn Féin/IRA for over three decades and as they say themselves, they have not gone away, you know."
"We need to be steadfast in the face of terrorism."
"Weakness and equivocation merely strengthen those who seek to undermine democracy."
"We also need clarity, however, on understanding the threat we face and the best measures to deal with that threat."
"For this reason we welcome the proposals to improve information-sharing between relevant authorities, which are foreseen under Mr Duquesne's report."
"As we have seen, Member States cooperating on a bilateral basis, without being hamstrung by needlessly heavy institutional constraints, have produced results."
"Joint investigation teams, on which I had the honour of being rapporteur in the previous Parliament, have been working well in this area, as referred to in the Díez González report."
"Such flexible, targeted, measured and appropriate responses are good examples of what can be achieved."
"But we also need to be aware of the nature of the threat that we are dealing with."
"The IRA is different from ETA, which is different from al-Qa'ida, but they are all evil and must be faced down and eliminated."
"Being unclear helps no one and I simply do not understand why some in this House do not want the use of the term ""fundamental Islamist organisations"" to describe al-Qa'ida and their ilk."
"Similarly, we also welcome the call, in the Borghezio report, to look at the question of those charities which are little more than front organisations for fund-raising for terrorism."
"It is deplorable that the Council has not seen fit to designate Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation."
"But above all else, we need to work together, exchanging information, assisting each other to deal with these ongoing threats, the undoubted threats to our freedom and to our democracy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that terrorism nowadays is a reality which we cannot, unfortunately, avoid."
"From a marginal phenomenon in the 1970's which restricted itself for the most part to within the framework of a state and to specific objectives, it has, unfortunately, developed over recent years into attacks which leave a great many dead and use advanced technological means."
"The cause of this rise is the perpetuation of unresolved political and social problems."
"The international community has failed to prove its unshaken intention to set peaceful cohabitation processes in motion in specific areas of conflict caused by religious, political and ethnic differences."
"Terrorism revived where the organised international community, or a part of it, unilaterally endeavoured to impose solutions through violence, which resulted in the creation of new, more violent conflicts."
"We all know that violence does not only not stop violence, but also strengthens it."
"As long as the Palestinian question, for example, remains unresolved, terrorism will spread, feeding the extremism which is in fact the basic cause of terrorism."
"However, terrorism cannot be combated through judicial and policing measures alone."
"The integrated crisis management systems, the monitoring and computer processing of suspicious information, the fight against financing for terrorism, the effective exchange of information or the approval of a common definition for terrorism are preventive and repressive mechanisms."
"They do not get to the root of the evil."
"The debate and vote today in the European Parliament on the eight reports which aim to combat it are important."
"Nonetheless, we all know that they are not enough."
"We are not in a position with such measures to make terrorism disappear."
"The final resolution of this scourge must be sought over and above coordinated preventive and repressive action by the Community."
"The solution lies in achieving conditions of world peace, equality and prosperity."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini and Mr de Vries, I would firstly congratulate the rapporteurs on their improvements to the Council’s anti-terrorist proposals which are indeed designed to make the fight against terrorism more effective in a number of excellent ways."
"The balance between freedoms and rights must, however, be maintained and our democratic European system improved."
"At present, a car almost has better rights than a human being, for a car can have financial legislation removed by the European Parliament and the EC Court of Justice."
"These issues highlight the need for a new Constitution that will better enable us to combat crime and terrorism."
"The issue of data storage splendidly illustrates the way in which the pillar system has come to the end of the road."
"We need a new treaty through which privacy can be protected and disproportionate measures and duties opposed."
"Data protection is needed in all legislation and not, as now, only in a part of it."
"Mrs Niebler offered a constructive explanation of the European Parliament’s criticisms in this area, and I agree with what she said."
"We have not seen any evidence of the need for the proposed measures in the area of data retention."
"The Council has acted provocatively and decided to implement legislation opposed by the European Parliament."
"Such action weakens our democracy."
"That is not what we need right now. We need to move in the opposite direction."
"We need strengthened democracy and more vigorous action by the Council, and I hope that, in future, the Council will listen to the European Parliament to a much greater degree than it has done so far."
"Mr President, I noticed that Mr Kirkhope did not describe the IRA, and nor indeed did Mr Allister, as a fundamentalist Roman Catholic organisation, and they were quite right not do so."
"I think it would be a grave error to start labelling organisations here as one religion or another."
"What they all share is a desire to achieve political ends through anti-democratic efforts."
"That is the basic definition in my view of terrorism: using violence in an anti-democratic way to achieve a political objective."
"I would remind Mr Kirkhope and others that the experience in Northern Ireland and everywhere else is that by labelling sections of society you actually increase alienation and you drive recruitment to the organisations that are engaged in terrorism."
"We must respond to terrorism politically, economically and socially."
"Of course we have to defend our democratic way of life when it is threatened by violence, but we have to do so in a way that does not deny or reduce basic human rights, not only for society in general, but for those sections of society which are alienated from society at large."
"We must engage with all of our citizens and seek to integrate them."
"We must seek to ensure that they achieve in life what they set out to achieve, and not be alienated from us."
"It is extremely important therefore that the measures we are proposing here today are proportionate and justified, and are effective, not only in dealing with terrorism, but also in seeking to ensure that terrorism cannot thrive."
"We must therefore do more than simply put security measures in place."
"My final point is in relation to bioterrorism."
"Could I ask those who seek to heighten fears about bioterrorism to recognise the reality of terrorism."
"The preferred weapons of terrorism are a few ounces of semtex in a holdall, a motor car, semi-automatic rifles and handguns-look at the experience of terrorism anywhere in the world-these are the weapons that are in use."
"It is not sarin gas which creates the spectacular death and destruction which the terrorists need for the 6 o'clock news."
"Mr President, I want to express my enthusiastic support for Mr Alvaro's report."
"It would be an act of folly if the proposed data retention scheme went through in its current form."
"Cybercrime is a real plague, threatening to compromise the stability and security of our information systems."
"It needs to be targeted with meaningful controls."
"However, burdening telecommunications companies and Internet service providers with the cost of storing all data they process for one year is a poorly considered response, a shot in the dark."
"Regardless of whether those transactions and communications go on record, the true criminal, one who is committed to avoiding easy detection, will know how to cover his tracks."
"In any case, given the volume of data that would have to be retained, particularly Internet data, it is unlikely that the comprehensive analysis of the data would ever be carried out in time to be of any use."
"We have seen clear indications that it was not for lack of data that US security agencies missed important clues in the lead up to the 11 September attacks, but rather that they lacked manpower to transcribe, translate and analyse the material."
"Some have argued that the cost of data retention should be borne by governments, not companies."
"Either way it is a waste of money."
"Aside from the negative financial consequences, the system would infringe individual privacy, as many colleagues have agreed."
"The European Convention on Human Rights gives us clear guidelines, enforced by the European Court of Justice, on when this data can be stored."
"The proposed blanket scheme does not give any proper criteria that would meet the Convention on Human Rights."
"I call upon my colleagues to follow Mr Alvaro in bringing this proposal to a swift and complete end."
"Elsewhere, terrorism proposals have been in line with proportionality, but not in Mr Alvaro’s report."
"Mr President, I wish to focus attention on one detail which is often forgotten when terrorism is being spoken about."
"Terrorists finance their activity by traditional means, and with conventional crimes."
"That is why normal police work is also important in the fight against terrorism."
"Traditional police work is still faltering at European level."
"Europol has not become an authority that operates throughout the entire membership area, which its name implies."
"It is still an agency without proper resources or effective authority."
"National police forces keep information from the authorities in other countries with the result that there is still no genuine trust between Member States."
"Exchange of information and increased levels of trust would also boost transparency, which is what has been called for in this debate."
"A competent Europol cannot emerge in the current climate."
"That, however, is what is needed to safeguard other forms of European cooperation."
"Mr President, I want to speak specifically about the oral question from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which concerns bioterrorism."
"With the anthrax incidents in America, the attacks on the Japanese underground and the chemical attacks on the Kurds, we know that we are vulnerable if we do not take precautions against such bioterrorism."
"In 2004, the United States and the European Union agreed to take constructive joint steps to improve our capabilities in this regard."
"The Americans made a start with Project BioShield, and we want to know what the European Union is doing."
"In February, the Worldwide Security Conference said that Europe was woefully unprepared for terrorist attacks."
"In 2001, Europe began to take steps to make sure that it was prepared."
"Its aims were to set up a mechanism for information exchange, to develop an EU-wide system for the detection, identification and diagnosis of chemical agents, to build up a stock of medicines and vaccinations, to establish a database of healthcare specialists and to provide guidance for health authorities on how to respond and how to liaise with international bodies."
"But so far, not so good, because, as far as surveillance is concerned, we have established an early-warning system to detect airborne chemical agents, but its usefulness is limited, since it only operates for certain substances and would not guard against the contamination of water or food supplies."
"We have no EU-wide stock of vaccines, and in most countries our quarantine laws are outdated."
"The European Union has also established the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to, amongst other things, ‘defend Europe against bioterrorism’."
"It is crucial for the centre to be enhanced and made effective."
"The current stories about budget cuts for the centre are not acceptable and I hope that a strong message will be sent to the Commission and the Council."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this debate illustrates that Parliament is aware of the serious threat posed by terrorism and is determined to take strong action to combat it."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteurs."
"There is a threat to our society, to our way of life, to our freedom, and we will only combat that threat if there is full cooperation at both European and international levels, and if we have a coherent policy rather than a mere list of initiatives, as both the Commissioner and Mr Oreja have both rightly pointed out."
"On the other hand, those who favour a strategy whereby we pretend that we are not targets are fooling themselves, and are doing so on two counts."
"Firstly, because that attitude feeds into the very essence of terrorism, namely that by instilling fear, it prevents us from living our lives, and secondly because it is only one way of affording us practical protection from a violent and very real threat."
"Yet whilst we know about the danger and wish to take action, we are also aware that much remains to be done."
"Such is the case with bioterrorism, which was referred to a moment ago and which now represents a danger that we must learn to deal with and that we are still clearly ill-prepared to address."
"These weapons are inexpensive, small, easy to get hold of and have an enormous capacity for destruction, quite apart from the fact that merely simulating the use of such weapons is enough to cause widespread panic."
"Europe must therefore respond to the various requirements, be it via the Member States or by means of specific Community programmes."
"Stocks of medicines and vaccines must be kept, detection systems and rapid early warning systems must be improved, civil protection mechanisms such as national emergency plans must be stepped up, and a great deal of information must be made available."
"Furthermore, these are the concerns that the Commission has also expressed."
"It must not be forgotten, however, that the EU has made undertakings and it is now time to turn plans into action, and in the context of our international obligations, especially those taken on by the United States in the field of combating bioterrorism, which are being developed on the other side of the Atlantic in the form of Project BioShield."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that terrorism, and bioterrorism in particular, cuts across borders. The fight against it must also, therefore, cut across borders."
"Mr President, in many of our countries terrorist organisations continue to recruit, train, raise funds, gather information and, indeed, carry out acts of terrorism."
"On another level, there are still those who aim to inflict mass destruction on our democracies."
"The battle against these organisations is a continuous one and it is right that this should not be in the public gaze."
"It is our duty as politicians to ensure that our police, security and intelligence services are given every possible means and support for their difficult and often dangerous work, with proper safeguards for the liberties of our law-abiding citizens."
"It is also our duty to be single-minded in our condemnation of terrorism."
"Too often there are those who seek to apologise for or justify terrorism and abuse the human rights, civil liberties or anti-discrimination arguments in order to provide protection or legitimacy for terrorists whose causes they happen to favour."
"Our own governments send out confusing signals when they are seen to deal and compromise with terrorists and even sacrifice the reputation of our security forces and individual officers in order to ingratiate themselves with organisations such as the Provisional IRA in the United Kingdom."
"The so-called Tamil Tigers – the LTTE – continue to raise funds for their activities in the United Kingdom and in other European countries."
"Hizbollah, a terrorist group estimated to have been involved in 80% of the terrorist attacks against Israel, still does not feature on the EU list of proscribed organisations."
"It is right that there should be fresh measures in our counter-terrorist inventory in order to deal with an ever-changing threat and that these measures should be part of a seamless strategy."
"However, unless we are prepared to fight the terrorists politically and with genuine resolve, then the practical measures will come to nothing."
"In the United Kingdom we have highly professional and experienced security services, but their efforts are undermined by a failure on the part of government to take the most basic steps."
"In a report last month on the functioning of terrorist legislation in the UK, Lord Carlisle said that in some ports there was effectively no security regarding incomers."
"First of all, we need to get it right in our own countries."
"The EU should be involved only where there is some genuine, proven added value and not as a means of extending the competence of EU institutions into yet more areas of activity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, terrorism constitutes an extremely grave danger."
"That is also the reason why we are dealing with it today and why we have no fewer than seven reports on the subject before us."
"It is a problem that can only be solved jointly, together with the various governments in Europe."
"During this debate, the thought frequently crossed my mind that one or other of the referenda in France and the Netherlands might have had a different outcome if some voters had been more aware of the problems that concern us, if it could have been made clear that such problems are simply impossible to solve unless Europe acts as one."
"Perhaps the seven different reports and the numerous models are also an indication that we must focus on the essentials if we want people to understand this need for joint action and to consent to the pursuit of this approach."
"It is not a matter of forever producing new proposals and new programmes – and thereby raising people’s hopes too – but rather of ensuring that people take note that what we are doing to combat terrorism is bearing fruit, that the EU’s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator is not only a public authority but is also working successfully with the Commission in the quest for greater efficiency, that Europol and Eurojust are becoming effective instruments and that democratic control is taking place."
"It is absolutely imperative, as is stated in one of the reports, that we as a Parliament undertake to ensure that the instruments we introduce are subject to review during their lifetime."
"Have they had an effect?"
"What effect have they had?"
"Are any specific measures dispensable?"
"Is it not perhaps more important to focus on essentials?"
"This brings me to the final point I feel it is important to make."
"How trust can be squandered and how a key objective can be badly pursued are aptly illustrated by what we have on the table today under the heading of data retention, which is now being dealt with for the th time."
"This is a case where action is being taken for its own sake, where people are being mollified with measures that may ultimately do nothing to enhance their security."
"If that is so, it will not serve to persuade the public that Europe is important and beneficial and to make them accept the results of our work."
"I should not like to be held responsible for the public perception of the European Union."
"For the fifth or sixth time, I say that responsibility for this lies with the national governments, whose outburst of hyperactivity is designed to salve their consciences without actually achieving anything in terms of greater effectiveness."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank the seven rapporteurs for their exemplary work, which clearly shows that an all-embracing approach needs to be adopted towards the fight against terrorism, an approach covering many fields."
"I believe that these seven reports also demonstrate that Parliament attaches great importance to this issue of the fight against terrorism."
"We are still feeling the enormous impact of the events of 11 September 2001 and the attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004."
"These cowardly attacks have affected all of us, both as European citizens and citizens of the world."
"They were attacks on democracy and on the values we stand for, and that is why the fight against terrorism needs to be uncompromising, but at the same time a fight for democracy."
"It would be wrong to defend democracy by undermining it."
"Many of the speeches we have heard this morning have called for terrorism to be combated more effectively and for there to be a clear commitment to the fight against terrorism and terrorist networks, while stressing that this fight should not threaten our democratic rights and civil liberties."
"We are faced with a constant balancing act here: we need to safeguard our rights and our freedoms while unremittingly confronting those who wish to put those same rights and freedoms at risk."
"We are a long way from the Orwellian vision of an all-controlling state."
"However, we need to be vigilant if we wish to avoid any drift in that direction."
"Nor must we lose sight of the fact that terrorism exploits the full range of resources and new technologies and that it has become a global and globalised phenomenon, a network which makes use of the Internet just like any other globalised enterprise."
"If we are to stand up to this threat and fight this phenomenon, we can no longer afford to deprive ourselves of tools such as data retention."
"Nevertheless, it is important to respect private life in this context."
"It is always a question of proportionality."
"I agree with the concept of protecting private life that has been raised."
"Having said that, we cannot forgo making use of certain technology if we are to remain effective in combating terrorism."
"Europe needs to lead the way here."
"It is noticeable that elsewhere there is a tendency not to take this protection of private life and individual rights seriously."
"Europe must show that the war on terror and respect for our rights can go hand in hand, without the effectiveness of that war being sacrificed or weakened."
"I have also paid heed to the criticisms aired about the European Union as regards coordination and exchanges of information."
"Since the occurrence of these events, and in particular the attack in Madrid, there has been a great improvement in coordination, particularly thanks to Mr de Vries, who has been given a special remit to coordinate all the activities of the European Union and its Member States in the fight against terrorism."
"I would like to thank him for his work and his commitment in this area."
"I also noticed that some people are concerned that Europe is not prepared for other kinds of threat, even more terrible than those involved in the two attacks I have already mentioned."
"There is bio-terrorism for example, a threat that is hard for us to grasp or imagine."
"It is possible, however, and it is a threat that cannot just be brushed aside."
"For that reason, we need to be prepared to deal with it."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to reply to Mr Florenz’s question."
"He touched upon this very issue of the threat of bio-terrorism and that of nuclear terrorism."
"It is clear that this type of terrorism, which includes chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, represents a threat to peace and international security."
"We know that terrorist networks have shown a keen interest in such substances and weapons and that, if they were able to lay their hands on such weapons of mass destruction, they would be in a position to inflict damage on an unprecedented scale and undermine the democratic foundations of our societies."
"That is why this threat of biological, nuclear and chemical terrorism deserves to be given increased attention by the European Union."
"Parallels have been drawn with US legislation in this field."
"There is no doubt that Europe has a lot to learn from the United States, particularly as regards setting up special teams, stockpiling vaccines, carrying out research and development work on medical countermeasures, and so on. Some similar initiatives have already been taken by the Member States, and the institutions of the European Union have already committed themselves to activities of this kind."
"Accordingly, the Union now has an early warning system for all kinds of terrorist attacks, for which a central point called Argus will be created within the Commission."
"The directive amending the directive on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use now entitles the Member States temporarily to permit the distribution of authorised medicinal products in the case of an attack involving the spread of pathogens, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation."
"Anti-CBRN training for medical staff is being implemented."
"Information on civil defence capacity and blood banks is being exchanged as part of civil defence arrangements."
"Furthermore, wide-ranging research work is being carried out under the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development to enable a better response to acts of this kind."
"The Council’s strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is intended to prevent terrorists from gaining access to such weapons, and it is a matter for regret that the New York conference did not reach agreement on a common text, given that one aspect of the non-proliferation conference was the threat of terrorism in these areas."
"As part of another remit, in this case following on from the declaration on the fight against terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004, on 2 December 2004 the Council and the Commission adopted the EU solidarity programme on the consequences of terrorist threats and attacks, which revised the CBRN programme and widened it to cover all forms of terrorism."
"One of the fundamental principles of the EU strategy is that protection against the consequences of terrorist attacks is chiefly a matter for the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the declaration on solidarity against terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004 confirms that the institutions of the EU and the Member States firmly intend to mobilise all the instruments at their disposal to assist a Member State on its territory at the request of its political authorities."
"In this respect, I feel bound to refer to the provision in the Constitution which strengthens the nature of solidarity, particularly in the case of terrorist attacks."
"The CBRN programme, and its successor the solidarity programme, are multidisciplinary programmes involving political, technical, economic, diplomatic, military and legal resources."
"This is rather difficult, but there it is ..."
"In the context of the present solidarity programme, EU action against CBRN terrorism is based on six strategic objectives, which I would like briefly to mention."
"Threat analysis and assessment: several analyses of these threats have been carried out by Europol and the EU’s Joint Situation Centre, SITCEN."
"Prevention and reduction of vulnerability: legislative measures have been taken to improve compliance with international biosafety and biosecurity standards."
"Detection of CBRN attacks: the Commission has taken steps to extend and coordinate the Community’s systems for detection, communication and information in connection with chemical and biological threats, as well as with human, animal and plant health."
"Lastly, preparations to mitigate the impact of possible attacks: the Commission is assessing what capacity the Member States could make mutually available in terms of civil defence and as regards medical and pharmaceutical supplies."
"It is drawing up regulations for treating illnesses associated with these substances."
"For its part, the Council has created a database of military resources, as well as capacity relevant to protecting civilians against terrorist attacks, including CBRN attacks."
"In the context of the European Security and Defence Policy aspects of the fight against terrorism, civil/military interoperability in the field of CBRN is in the process of being examined."
"The Council is also carrying out work on an integrated crisis management system."
"International cooperation obviously has a very important part to play here: it broadly addresses the same objectives as the solidarity programme, that is to say the pooling of epidemiological information on cross-border transmission of contagious diseases, and cooperation on emergency planning, laboratory detection technology, non-proliferation, mutual assistance and response coordination."
"The United States is also taking part in this work."
"Another dialogue will be initiated at the appropriate time."
"We consider this international cooperation, particularly with the Americans, but also with all our other partners, to be extremely important in this context."
"Before we proceed to the vote and before my colleague Vice-President Frattini takes the floor, let me just say this by way of conclusion: I believe that the European Union is engaged in a worldwide process of preparation for the fight against all forms of terrorism."
"The war on terror, as I said at the beginning, and as your reports have clearly demonstrated, requires a global approach."
"There is one issue that we particularly need to take to heart: we must prevent terrorist groups from recruiting within our own societies."
"In fact it is such recruitment within our societies, especially amongst rootless young people who are poorly integrated into our own societies, that represents the greatest terrorist threat."
"These young people to some extent represent a breeding ground for acts that are hard to imagine, acts which reflect a kind of despair."
"This means that our strategy for combating terrorism needs to include a social aspect, an aspect covering the integration and treatment of these groups, particularly young people, who come from Islamic countries."
"In this way we can win this battle here on our own territory within the European Union, and that is absolutely vital."
"At this point I have the pleasure of welcoming our former colleague, Mr Gijs de Vries, whom I wish all the strength he needs for his great task."
"Welcome to the European Parliament, Mr de Vries."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly cannot respond in a few minutes to all of the important speeches made during a debate lasting approximately three hours."
"I would just like to make some very quick observations."
"I believe that there is broad consensus on the fact that, in combating terrorism, we require measures at European level, actions linked in a comprehensive European strategy, and balanced measures, which are primarily focused on prevention, on cooperation – also at international level – and on respect for people’s fundamental rights, including, obviously and above all, the right to privacy, which is a point raised by many Members in this House."
"There is a further principle that I believe must be highlighted, and that is that no one can be suspected of terrorism on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief, because that would genuinely mean the victory of terrorism, which relies on conflict between religions and civilisations."
"Whilst it is necessary, therefore, to understand the deep roots of terrorism, there must be no doubt, however, about the fact that terrorism can never be justified."
"We must know about the roots in order to eradicate them, but never to justify them."
"There is a profound distinction between those two concepts."
"In addition, we must devote our full attention to the measures decided upon at European level, that is to say, the action plan."
"You are probably aware that many Member States have not yet implemented many measures set out in the action plan."
"Right now, I can only mention two positive examples, those of Denmark and Hungary, two Member States that have, in contrast, implemented them all."
"I believe that they can be held up as models to the other Member States of the European Union."
"There is also a principle on which we are all agreed, and that is the solidarity principle."
"Firstly, solidarity among the Member States – and on this point I fully agree with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit. I believe that we must essentially introduce the principle enacted in the Constitutional Treaty, which makes provision for mutual solidarity among the Member States when one of them is attacked by terrorists."
"Secondly, solidarity towards the victims of terrorism, which is another of the lines of action on which Europe will have to focus."
"We have spoken at length about bioterrorism."
"In the first instance, the European Commission can press for the continuation and strengthening of the actions undertaken."
"It is making every effort to encourage the Member States to take all of the measures required for an appropriate level of preparedness in the event of a bioterrorist attack, and hopes to be able to rely on the full support of this House in persuading all of the Member States to act more incisively, by investing greater resources, because the threat of a bioterrorist attack cannot and must not find us unprepared."
"We will inform Parliament about all of the measures that we have undertaken, including the simulations of terrorist attacks and the international cooperation actions that we are conducting."
"To conclude, Mr President, I believe that the most powerful weapon against terrorism is the united action of the institutions, the Commission, Parliament, the Council, and civil society."
"We have to explain to our citizens that it is only by means of the united action of the institutions and society that there can be a genuinely European response to the challenge of terrorists, which is a challenge faced by us all."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"I think that we had a very helpful and full debate just now on the need to use all the means at our disposal to combat terrorism, as long as our basic rights and freedoms are respected."
"As I just said, it is vital to maintain that balance at all costs."
"A number of countries want to set up a system to tackle the resources at the disposal of terrorists."
"We know that terrorists are using all manner of possible technologies in an increasingly sophisticated way."
"This initiative therefore deserves to be followed up and explored, because it would provide us with a more effective means of countering the use of such technology, particularly over the Internet."
"Nevertheless, I must stress that the use of data retention must go hand in hand with respect for privacy and data protection."
"A balance needs to be struck between security on the one hand and freedom on the other."
"We must not, however, deprive ourselves out of hand of the use of means that in certain circumstances – and 11 May 2004 comes to mind once again here – could mean that human lives are spared, perhaps dozens, hundreds or even thousands of lives."
"That therefore means that the Council wishes to adhere to its proposal."
"Accordingly, in accordance with Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the text is referred back to the committee responsible with the observations of the President of the Council."
"Mr President, I wish to inform you that we have withdrawn Amendment 14 to recital Q."
"Mr President, recital C could be amended by the addition of a few simple words, as the first necessity is a clear definition of political terror and terrorism."
"I see this as a logical remark, as nobody could say that is better not to have a definition or that it is not worth making the effort."
"I would therefore ask you to support this amendment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to speak before the vote on this amendment, which in fact repeats the paragraph that has already been approved."
"This Parliament has condemned preventative war twice over, which strikes me as being a positive sign."
"Amendment 1 has been put to the vote and has been adopted."
"Mr President, I should like to propose, in agreement with Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, who is the author of this amendment, and being aware that the Socialist Group also has a similar oral amendment, that at the end, after the words ‘trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings’, it should read: ‘and financing through extortion, including the so-called revolutionary tax’."
"Mr President, I would simply like to say that we accept Baroness Ludford's amendment and we will not therefore present any other oral Amendment."
"We believe that amendment to be perfect and we will support it."
"This amendment will therefore be inserted into Amendment 4, and that amendment, which has been modified twice, will be put to the vote."
". The report by Mrs Laperrouze, together with the Commission’s proposal, sets out priorities for the trans-European energy networks on the basis of the creation of a more open and competition-based internal energy market, one that is beholden to the principles of competition."
"As we know, the privatisations in the sector were justified by the so-called Lisbon Strategy, to which we have always been opposed."
"Occasional concerns with consumer protection and with the use of renewable energy are raised, yet those play second fiddle to the concerns of the market, or in other words, the interests of the large economic groups and the multinationals operating in the sector. We are opposed to that objective."
"In the meantime, of course, we speak of universal access to services and the obligation to provide public services, yet this only serves to underline the need to build and maintain energy infrastructure – as defined by the Commission, and based on opinions and plans drawn up by the Member States – so as to enable the internal market to operate efficiently, with due regard to the procedures for consulting the people affected, and without detracting from the strategic criteria and the above-mentioned criteria and obligations added by Parliament."
"Despite all of this, the funding is still meagre."
"We recommend that the EU countries cooperate on cross-border issues on which EU cooperation can add value in relation to what can be achieved within existing international cooperation structures."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of the overall report on trans-European energy networks, because this is an important cross-border European issue."
"We support those amendments that open the way for limited top-down government."
"We welcome the idea of using the EU’s existing structural funds to finance the costs involved in this type of cooperation."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on the important and timely report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decisions No 96/391/EC and No 1229/2003/EC. I support this report, especially in that it proposes common rules for the European gas and electricity market, in which the environment is an ever-present factor and the safety of the electricity supply is guaranteed in each of the Member States, regions and territories."
"Incorporating the new Member States’ energy networks into trans-European networks will undoubtedly facilitate the cohesion process in the enlarged EU."
"Nonetheless, when new infrastructure is built, maintained or enhanced, the environmental impact must be taken into account and procedures must be followed for the prior notification and consultation of the people affected, as laid down in Community and national legislation."
"The EU’s dependence on one single source of energy supply might have ramifications for its external policy and might restrict its role on the international stage."
"It is therefore essential for technological development in European industry that new sources of alternative energy be developed."
". Increasing energy efficiency is an important aim for many reasons."
"This is why we support all reasonable efforts to ensure that energy is used efficiently."
"The present Rothe report, however, only partly satisfies this requirement. It proposes too much bureaucracy, too much centralism and questionable methods of increasing energy efficiency in Europe."
"Despite all these misgivings, we shall approve the report at the first reading, because the benchmarking approach, which we favour, is included as an option."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to embrace the benchmarking system in place of the uniform percentage targets and to proceed quickly to make the necessary preparations for the implementation of such a system so that there will be no need to apply uniform percentage targets, even for an introductory period."
"If this line is not followed, we shall vote against these binding percentage targets at the second reading."
". We naturally endorse the goals of greater energy end use efficiency and of renewable energy contributing 20% of overall energy consumption in the EU."
"We accordingly support measures aimed at achieving this objective and therefore voted in favour of most of the rapporteur’s proposals."
"It is interesting to see how Parliament deems the public sector capable of providing a lead in this area, and thus sets more ambitious goals for the sector."
"We object, however, to the emphasis on liberalising the market in the area of energy efficiency, in particular domestic consumption, from July 2007, as contained in a number of the rapporteur’s proposals. We voted against those proposals."
"Increased energy efficiency is an important part of the strategy for achieving the Kyoto Protocol’s objectives."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU should set detailed objectives in terms of energy savings or specify how these are to be achieved."
"The EU can and should intervene in genuinely cross-border environmental issues, but it must not dictate energy policy objectives."
"Our vote against the European Parliament’s report does not imply support for the Commission’s original proposal."
". If we wish to make real energy savings – and this ought to be our wish – that swim against the tide of increased energy use, both in developing and developed countries, one of our main tasks will be to warn the citizens of the impact of excessive energy use."
"Making people aware of the problems is the best way to involve them in the necessary solutions."
"As such, the proposals put forward in this report, particularly those concerning awareness-raising, among both public and private users, of the benefits that can be derived from saving energy, will prove to be extremely useful."
"We are open to the idea of the EU countries creating a Web-based portal where the Member States make relevant environmental indicators available."
"We take a critical view of those wordings that open the way for the EU to implement similar measures within other policy areas."
"The rapporteur has not clearly specified which areas are in the running and to what degree."
"We also take the view that the report provides too much detailed regulation and that the Member States are called upon to make data available within too many areas."
"The basic geographical conditions vary from one Member State to another."
"The same types of information and indicator are thus not relevant to all countries."
"For the aforesaid reasons, we have chosen to vote against Parliament’s report."
"We believe that the Commission’s proposal is less far-reaching and better worded than the report presented by Parliament."
". Data sharing between Member States makes an important contribution towards building a widespread and strongly-rooted feeling of trust between all concerned, and is naturally useful in and of itself."
"In this particular case, the data that can be obtained in this way is both cross-border in nature and can be used for cross-border purposes."
"For this reason, namely the objective of sharing data, I am naturally in favour."
"The June List supports institutional competition and therefore regrets that the Commission has considered it necessary to regulate this market too."
"At present, the legislation applies where reinsurance is written, meaning that the market players themselves choose which legislation is most appropriate."
"It is not to citizens that the directive primarily offers protection. Instead, it concerns regulations governing financial institutions and trade between companies (B2B)."
"These players carry out their own risk assessments on a daily basis and do not need further EU legislation."
"Not being able to vote against the Commission’s proposals, we therefore choose to abstain from voting."
". As I did at the Committee stage, I supported today the compromise package as commended to us in the Skinner Report."
"Financial services make a very substantial contribution to the economy of Scotland, and re-insurance, whether directly or indirectly, affect Scottish-based enterprises and consumers."
"I welcome this proposal, which makes progress towards a Europe-wide system of re-insurance provision and regulation, as well as providing an opportunity to tackle the situation in the USA, where vast amounts of capital are tied up because of their collateral requirement leading to extra costs currently being passed on to consumers."
"The rapporteur is to be congratulated for his work on this document."
". We voted in favour of the report before us because it improves on the Commission’s proposal, and indeed includes some of the proposals that we tabled."
"It is true that, on certain issues, we could have gone further, especially with regard to the amounts generated by modulation and implementing them in support measures for the agriculture and forestry sectors, and with regard to the increase in support for farmers receiving the least aid."
"If the Commission were at least to take this resolution on board, however, that would be a positive step."
"Doubts remain as to including measures aimed at nature conservation and at the Natura 2000 network in the support programme for rural development, especially because there is no indication that doing so would prevent a reduction in the budget allotted to rural development."
"The ongoing debate is not promising, and everything points to cuts taking place, thus leading to a policy that will fail to promote economic and social cohesion, jobs and social inclusion."
"It is known that we are opposed to cofinancing and the liberalisation of the farming market, given that this is at variance with a policy of promoting a form of rural development in which the populations are settled and in which family farming and small and medium-sized holdings are supported, a policy based on respect for the diverse character of the different Member States of the EU."
"We are completely opposed to this report and believe that, in terms of its individual parts, it is quite absurd."
"We absolutely cannot support the report’s proposal to increase the appropriations in relation to the Commission’s proposals."
"We wonder why the Member States cannot manage to develop their rural areas themselves?"
"Or is the general intention behind the EAFRD based on a desire for others to foot the bill?"
"Reasons in terms of distribution policy as to why the rich countries should help the poor countries in the EU may be adduced but, in that case, the poor countries should decide for themselves how the aid is used."
"Amendment 29 refers to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"This proposal has now been defeated and can no longer be referred to."
". I welcome this report, and the comments of the rapporteur, on the importance of ensuring a healthy rural economy."
"Successful agriculture and forestry industries in Scotland are essential contributors to the viability of our many rural communities."
"The geography of Scotland means that many of our rural areas are Less Favoured Areas which require specific support measures."
"EU support can play an important part in assisting rural businesses to meet the many competitive challenges which they face."
"I hope that the future budget of the EU will provide adequately for rural development programmes, and that the UK and Scottish Governments will enable the full potential benefits to be realised."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her timely report on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)."
"I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament must oppose attempts to reduce the amounts earmarked for rural development."
"The intensity of the proposed aid for the outermost regions should be kept at current levels."
". One of the most important aspects of the common agricultural policy, namely its financing, has yet to be decided upon."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report regardless of the outcome of the debate on the Financial Perspective."
"European policy on this issue should in fact be more rural than merely agricultural, comprising a series of measures and axes that form a coherent policy for the rural world."
"This is my view and the thrust of the view expressed in the report."
"The financing of these policies should form part of the debate on the Financial Perspective, in which we shall have the opportunity to assess the necessary amounts."
"For the time being, I shall merely express my support for a simplification model that seeks a coherent policy for a space that is diverse, yet sufficiently homogenous to be treated as a whole."
"Mr President, according to a study, governments have spent more than 191 billion dollars on the war on terrorism in 2005."
"This expenditure is set to snowball over the next ten years."
"Forty-four per cent of this amount has been spent by the United States on military and police operations, for example."
"It remains somewhat questionable, however, whether the anti-terrorism strategy has been succeeding."
"A prime example of this spurious success is Iraq, which has become a breeding ground for terrorism in the wake of the war."
"We have hitherto confined ourselves to treating the symptoms instead of trying to root out this evil."
"As a result, extremists have benefited from ignorance and misjudgement of Islam to recruit ever-increasing numbers of militants, many of whom are drawn from the lower strata of the Muslim population."
"This is where we have to focus our efforts; we must adopt new ways of thinking and follow new paths."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of this report."
"We wish to make it clear that we are, however, opposed to setting up a European register of convictions."
"The proposal presented by Sweden, Ireland, France and the United Kingdom on the retention of communications traffic data is aimed at improving cooperation in matters of criminal law."
"We fully support that aim since it is important for the Member States and the Community to provide the crime prevention authorities with adequate tools for carrying out their work."
"Sweden has had great success in fighting crime and clearing up serious individual crimes by using retained traffic communications data."
"The same also applies to certain other Member States."
"The need for, and reasonableness of, the draft framework decision has not, however, been sufficiently clarified by the four Member States."
"It is therefore necessary for the four Member States and/or the Commission to come back with good examples of when the retention of communications traffic data has been very important to the prevention, investigation, detection and bringing to court of crimes and punishable offences, including terrorism. It is also necessary for them clearly to show the reasonableness of, and need for, legislation in this area, given the possible consequences for privacy it would entail."
"The June List is in favour of increased cooperation between the Member States in combating terrorism and other serious cross-border crime."
"These are, however, what are known as third pillar issues, concerning intergovernmental police and legal cooperation, and decisions concerning them have to be taken by the Member States in the Council and not by supranational EU institutions."
"It is thus for the national parliaments, and not the European Parliament, to assess the results of negotiations and call for responsibility to be accepted."
"The June List cannot therefore support Parliament’s amendments, in spite of the fact that we would have supported the contents of several of them if we had been sitting in the Swedish Parliament."
"Where report A6-0162/2005 is concerned, we support Sweden’s initiative in the Council concerning a Framework Decision on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the EU."
"We support most aspects of Mr Bösch’s report on the fight against fraud."
"The fact that the variety of tax rates on tobacco in the EU Member States leads to problems involving cigarette smuggling is a known fact, mentioned in paragraphs 33 and 36."
"We agree with these statements, but we are opposed to further reductions in tobacco taxes."
"Reduced prices for tobacco increase consumption and have a harmful effect on public health."
"We believe there are better ways of getting to grips with the problems of smuggling."
"Nor can we support the view that customs authorities should be equipped with mobile units or that the EU agency for the external borders should also conduct customs investigations."
". Despite the technical aspect that the rapporteur attempted to introduce into this report, the issue has a major political part to play in the unrestrictedly ‘open and competition-based market’ that is being sought."
"In the approach to this issue, underlying political issues keep coming to the surface, resulting in issues that are – or can be – politically different being lumped together."
"Protecting the Communities’ financial interests by ensuring that management is not wasteful and fraudulent belongs to one category, and combating fraud (albeit with a common zone on fraud within the ‘Communities’ bodies), which comes in the form of various kinds of tax evasion, parallel and black markets and trafficking of various kinds, belongs to a quite different one."
"Among the many important points raised in the report, I should like to highlight the fact that the Member States have been given new responsibilities, whilst having some of their previous responsibilities removed, by means of permanently disqualifying and dismissing public workers and hiring private firms to do some of this work."
"As regards this important political issue, I should like to express my criticism of the ‘delegation to private firms of missions of the European public service’ as stated in the report."
"Terrorism was once the weapon of the Communist revolutionary international."
"It is now used by the Islamic revolutionary international, whose objective is the destruction of western civilisation and the establishment of Islamic republics throughout the world and particularly in Europe."
"In fact, through mass Muslim immigration, our governments have imported the politico-religious civil war raging in North Africa and in the Middle East into Europe."
"By means of terror – violent or not – Islamists want, on the one hand, to control the Muslim masses for the purposes of revolution and, on the other hand, to paralyse our nations."
"The electoral defeat of the Aznar government in Spain, which was considered to be hostile to Islamists, just days after the attack carried out by Moroccan immigrants on 11 March 2004, formed part of this strategy."
"The same applies to the assassination of the Dutch film maker Theo Van Gogh."
"Demands to wear the Muslim headscarf and to have halal menus in school canteens represent the early stages of this process of subversion."
"Mass terrorism is the final stage of that process."
"Until we have recognised the reality of this danger, Islamic terrorists will pursue their revolutionary jihad."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted against setting up a European Public Prosecutor's Office as proposed by Mrs Díez Gonzáles in the report on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU anti-terrorism Action Plan."
"The Moderate delegation believes that public prosecutors’ offices should operate at national level."
"Prevention, preparation and response in connection with terrorist attacks are important and necessary measures."
"That such work should lead to the EU having to define and implement a European political project does not, however, make sense."
"The victims of terrorism can be supported in better ways than by setting up further EU authorities."
"We are, moreover, opposed to exploiting terrorist acts and other tragic events to extend the power and influence of the EU institutions."
"The June List has therefore voted against the report."
". This report fails to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism, such as the serious deterioration in the world’s situation, the spiral of violence fed by the militarisation of international relations, the attacks on the sovereignty of states and people – in other words, state terrorism – the exploitation caused by unbridled capitalism, the inhuman deterioration in social inequality and the millions of human beings living in abysmal conditions."
"Under the pretext of the ‘fight against terrorism’, it proposes to create and reinforce an entire information network, and to set up security organisations that are centralised at European level – imposing ‘supranational’ structures in order to bypass cooperation between sovereign countries – thereby promoting repressive measures that form part of broader strategies to perpetuate an unjust world order, based on the permanent use of force, of the arms race and of economic and financial domination."
"Hence the unacceptable agreements between the EU and the United States concerning the exchange of personal data, the unacceptable criminalisation of organisations fighting for the fundamental rights of a people, such as the right to sovereignty and independence and the unacceptable attacks on sovereign countries."
"Consequently, our group voted against."
".– The package of eight reports being presented today to the European Parliament details the so-called EU strategy for combating terrorism, in the aim of strengthening the policy to serve big business against the rising grass-roots movement and the peoples' resistance to imperialism."
"The Oreja report endeavours to substantiate the need to escalate this policy and pass to the stage of preventive action against terrorism, in line with the American imperialist doctrine of preventive war."
"At the same time, it uses 'Islamic terrorism' to neatly introduce an expanded definition of terrorist action and terrorist groups, by which it of course means the movements and organisations which are contesting or fighting to overturn the present regime."
"This report also makes an obvious effort to create a climate of disorientation of the workers by posing the question of 'terrorism' as the greatest danger, so that the proposed autocratic measures are accepted and there is grass-roots consent to the constitution of new repressive bodies and mechanisms."
"The workers and peoples of Europe will react to the painful efforts of the EU to step up its repressive measures and mechanisms against the grass-roots movement with disobedience and insubordination at national level and by strengthening their fight and coordination to overturn them."
". The Oreja report – A6-0166/2005 – on a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on terrorist attacks: prevention, preparation and response(2005/2043(INI)), as part of the anti-terrorism package adopted in the European Parliament today, also pursues the aim of creating a legal area where the weapons with which war on terrorism is waged include mutual recognition of court judgments, police measures and exchanges of information between police forces and between intelligence services."
"As a result, fundamental rights are liable to fall by the wayside."
"This approach, in fact, has come under increasingly heavy criticism in the Member States since the establishment of the European arrest warrant, because the fairly harmless-sounding formula ‘mutual recognition’ turns out, on closer inspection, to be a very potent instrument."
"A person’s extradition to another Member State of the EU, for example, closes the door on the possibility of judicial review."
"The most critical points of the Oreja report are:"
"- the aim of an ‘exchange of information between police forces and between intelligence services’,"
"- the aim of an ‘exchange of information regarding suspected terrorists and their organisations with third countries and international organisations’, and"
"- the aim of encouraging ‘the increasing specialisation of Europol and Eurojust in the fight against [...] terrorism’."
"Democratic control of prosecuting authorities, effective protection of personal data and the horizontal division of powers do not feature at all in this regime."
".The report is fully harmonised with the endeavour to disorientate and terrify the peoples on the pretext of terrorism."
"It adopts the relevant Commission communication calling on the Member States to prepare (including in cooperation with private security firms) lists of installations which are considered to be 'critical infrastructures' (private, government, public utility) in the following sectors: energy, communications, banks, healthcare, food, water, transport, public administration etc."
"They will have access to all the information on possible risks of 'terrorist attacks' and will help to process the anti-terrorism strategy."
"All this will be incorporated into a 'European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP), while for the collection and exchange of any information which will contribute towards the early warning system for crises and emergencies, another spy network (ARGUS) will be created."
"The above measures, in conjunction with the European terrorism law, aim apart from anything else to create preconditions so that any form of fight used by the workers' and grass-roots movement in their struggle can be considered as terrorist action."
"The rapporteur's endeavour to include risks from natural disasters and the references to respect for fundamental rights are an alibi for passing the new autocratic measures."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted against setting up a European register of criminal sentences."
"For the same reason, we have voted against the report as a whole."
". Terrorism, let there be no doubt, is the dictatorship of this century, and it should be fought unstintingly."
"In recent years, events have led to a gradual awakening, which this debate shows has neither worn off nor lost its focus."
"We know that there is a threat against our way of life, our society and the freedom we enjoy."
"We are also aware that our greatest virtues – such as freedom, respect for the individual and solidarity – can lead to weaknesses in the fight against terrorism."
"It is therefore essential that we strike a constant balance between what we must sacrifice and the elements that are indispensable to preserving our way of life."
"In this context, in light of the progress that has been made, the widespread commitment, the difficulties encountered, the need for amendments and the warnings of the shortcomings that still exist, the debate on this and the other reports in the plenary session should be addressed from a similar perspective."
"After all, there has been a clear sign here that there is awareness; awareness of the risk, awareness of the need for action to be taken and of what cannot and should not be demanded, even in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by responding to the last remark from the chair."
"It may be that the adoption of my report by a two-thirds majority of the temporary committee has made a similar result appear likely in tomorrow’s vote, and this has possibly taken some of the heat out of the issue."
"When, on 15 September, the decision was taken to appoint it, the temporary committee was given a mandate to determine Parliament’s negotiating position on the political challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged European Union."
"After working on this for seven months, we present to you today our proposal on the negotiating position of the European Parliament."
"The fact that the temporary committee was able to adopt the report by a two-thirds majority in spite of all the opposing views that exist on specific points was due entirely to the close cooperation and mutual trust with which its members fulfilled their mandate."
"For this reason I should like to thank you first of all, Mr President, in your capacity as chairman of the temporary committee, and to express my special thanks to the coordinators and the highly dedicated Members who were responsible for drafting the opinions of their respective committees."
"I thank all of you sincerely for our close and fruitful cooperation over these past months."
"I should also like to add a special word of thanks to the staff of the Secretariat, every one of whom did fantastic work for us all."
"Following our deliberations on 22 working papers, our discussions with 17 committees, which have given their opinions, and also our hearings with delegations from the national parliaments, to which I attach great importance, this report can make good our claim, as an institution, to have analysed and assessed the Commission’s proposals most carefully and most intensively."
"This means that the result we present to you today represents a robust, coherent and comprehensive solution."
"Without Parliament’s consent, there will be no Financial Perspective."
"We want a solution, but we are not prepared to sell our soul for it."
"We have endorsed the parts of the Commission’s proposals that we considered to be right and proper, particularly with regard to the aims of more growth and employment as proclaimed in the Lisbon Strategy."
"We have made cuts where appropriate without endangering the integration process."
"We have set our own political priorities, and we do not intend to confine our discussion to mere number-crunching but to make the absolutely essential improvements to the basic conditions for annual budgeting by simplifying the programmes."
"We have tried to walk the tightrope between synergy and subsidiarity without ever losing sight of our obligation to exercise budgetary discipline."
"We have also, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, advocated synchronisation of the term of the Financial Perspective with Parliament’s legislative term and the Commission’s term of office."
"We want to see a binding obligation to simplify programmes as well as reform of the Financial Regulation, and we insist that the new legislation on multiannual programmes must preserve the rights of Parliament in full and as a matter of course in every single area of activity, including areas such as foreign policy."
"A solution on the expenditure side will only be feasible if it is accompanied by short-term and long-term solutions on the Union’s own resources, corrective mechanisms designed to improve the internal balance of the budget."
"If we nail our colours to the mast by calling for more research and development and for lifelong learning, the public will expect us to deliver these things."
"If, at the same time, we proclaim our support for cohesion in full awareness of the current state of the debate within the Council, and if we are also compelled to acknowledge that the present debates in the Council on citizenship of the Union – on the protection of our citizens against internal dangers and on the protection of our external borders – and on the role of the EU as a global partner manifestly confront us with a problem of chronic underfunding of strategic policy areas, it becomes clear that this will be a subject on which we shall have to engage in some tough negotiating with the Council."
"Given the prospect of this difficult debate and in the light of our experience with Agenda 2000, we believe that a new instrument to provide reserves and flexibility on the basis of existing agreements is an absolutely essential agenda item for the forthcoming negotiations."
"At the end of the day, we arrived at figures that boil down to 1.18% in commitment appropriations and 1.07% in payment appropriations."
"I ask all of you to approve this report tomorrow in the form in which the temporary committee commends it to you."
"This will strengthen our negotiating position."
"It would also give the Commission more scope to shape the difficult process of European integration."
"The Financial Perspective should serve – if not entirely, at least to some extent – as an important demonstration of commitment to a more people-centred and forward-looking Europe."
". Mr President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity of addressing Parliament this afternoon before you vote on the resolution on the future Financial Perspectives."
"In accordance with the budgetary powers devolved on Parliament by the Treaty, the Luxembourg Presidency gives top priority to maintaining an open and unreserved dialogue with Parliament in this field."
"This is one of the most important questions facing the European Union at this present time."
"It also comes at a time when the European Union simply must not fail."
"I also want to express our gratitude for the work done by the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Union, which you chaired, Mr President."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"Your contribution to this complex and, to say the least, politically sensitive debate has been important in two respects."
"Firstly, Parliament has shown realism and taken a consistent approach."
"Secondly, with this report and this resolution you set as it were the main parameters for the negotiations that will follow those in the Council and which, in the end, will be just as decisive for the Financial Perspectives as those that take place in the European Council next week."
"In any case, as the Presidency takes every opportunity to point out, this first round of negotiations in the Council is only a first round, and Parliament’s agreement is also required if we are to have Financial Perspectives."
"What is the state of negotiations in the Council?"
"Let me explain to you how we see the situation in the Council and how we intend preparing for the debates on this matter, especially at the European Council that will be held next week."
"First of all, I would like to stress that the Presidency remains determined to reach an agreement at next week’s European Council."
"Nothing should be allowed to distract us from the important task of giving the European Union the resources it needs to accomplish the tasks that lie before it in the years ahead."
"The conclusion of an agreement in June is the best way of sending a positive signal and the only way of determining the scale of those resources early enough so that the various instruments and legislative programmes can be adopted and implemented at the right time."
"Today more than ever, the Union must show that it is still fully able to take decisions, that it is still capable of reaching compromises in a matter as crucial for its smooth operation as the Financial Perspectives and, hence, the budgetary policy for the years ahead."
"You are familiar with the negotiating framework method that was successfully used during the last negotiations under the German Presidency and which enabled agreement to be reached in Berlin."
"That framework allowed us to whittle down the number of possible solutions and to reach a final agreement."
"The most recent version of this negotiating framework dates from the end of last week and will be examined by the foreign affairs ministers at the conclave to be held next Sunday evening."
"At the same time, the European Council President is holding bilateral meetings with his opposite numbers at which they are examining each other’s difficulties and trying to lay the foundations for a compromise that will be acceptable to all."
"I would like to draw your attention to a number of aspects of this latest version of the negotiating framework."
"I will also comment on a number of points made in your report and in the motion for a resolution on the Financial Perspectives."
"First of all, even before the debates in April’s General Affairs Council we clearly said that a number of cuts, which some find unfortunate and others inevitable, would be necessary in all fields if we were to strike a balance between highly divergent points of view as to the final overall level of expenditure."
"That is incidentally not entirely at odds with the thinking in your Committee."
"The latest version of the negotiating framework includes for the first time figures for each heading."
"Overall, the total of EUR 870 billion at which we have arrived, that is around 1.06% of the European Union’s gross national income, is close to the figures that have been discussed."
"Although this total is less than the Commission’s initial proposal, the figures for each heading nevertheless represent on average increases of between 5% and 18% annually compared to 2006."
"No one can therefore doubt our determination to continue providing the resources necessary to move forward with the Union’s policies."
"It is also true that the very weak growth in national budgets, which must not be overlooked, inevitably has consequences for the European budget."
"Secondly, the debates in Council have been concerned chiefly with heading 1 B, that is cohesion policy."
"Contrary to what some people are saying, this heading has not been particularly targeted by the cuts."
"We have not made this heading the adjustment variable of a minimalist budget package."
"In fact, the Presidency agrees with Parliament that cohesion policy is the expression of the Union’s internal solidarity."
"The Presidency is therefore doing all it can to keep cuts in this field to a minimum."
"Overall, the expenditure for this heading in the latest version of the negotiating framework represents 0.37% of the European Union’s gross national income."
"The Presidency has, however, proposed a number of changes to the mechanisms for allocating cohesion policy funds."
"It has done so following discussions that generally revealed – and not without difficulty, I have to say – a desire to give priority to funding the least prosperous regions and Member States."
"The Presidency has therefore adopted an approach based on the principle of solidarity, ensuring that resources are directed to those most in need."
"To do that, a slightly higher percentage of the ‘cohesion’ heading’s funds had to be allocated to convergence and the ceilings adjusted so that funds go where they are needed most."
"I know that some countries and regions are not happy with this approach."
"The Presidency is continuing to listen to them."
"However, while adjustments are still possible – and we are working on them day by day – our constraints are such that there is relatively little room for manoeuvre."
"Thirdly, the Presidency is aware that the March European Council set ambitious targets for relaunching the Lisbon Strategy."
"Those targets will require additional financial resources."
"We are all committed to the objectives of competitiveness and employment."
"We all want to develop research more in the Union."
"We know, too, that the Union has to accompany the social and economic reforms we are obliged to undertake."
"Employment remains a major priority for us all, as do education and vocational training."
"It is true that the Presidency has cut the amounts proposed by the Commission, but the rate of growth by comparison with the present period remains considerable: 8% growth per year in real terms."
"Hardly any national budget – and I do not know of one – makes such an additional effort."
"The same is true of Heading 3 A, freedom, security and justice."
"This objective is also a priority because it comes in response to the public’s concerns in the matter."
"In our latest proposal, it receives an annual real-terms increase of 18% compared to 2006, a rise of nearly 200% over seven years."
"The rates of growth for external relations, especially for achieving the Union’s global partnership objective, are still 5% in real terms and we have not included the EDF budget like you have."
"Fourthly, the latest version of the negotiating framework goes into the question of resources in slightly more detail."
"There is no doubt that the European Council’s success will depend on agreement being reached on both expenditure and resources."
"In its quest for a solution, the Presidency has taken as its starting point the Fontainebleau conclusions of 1984 – I will not say Fontainebluff like Mr Juncker did."
"So far as resources are concerned, negotiations will only succeed if a satisfactory solution is found to the United Kingdom rebate."
"In this connection, the Presidency is proposing that in 2007 the amount of that country’s rebate should be equal to its nominal average over the seven-year period immediately preceding the last enlargement and that it should then decline with effect from the following year."
"I believe this is a fair proposal because we are all committed to the effort of solidarity that our Union’s enlargement represents."
"Also in line with the Fontainebleau conclusions, which raise the question of budgetary imbalances for other countries, the Presidency has further proposed that specific measures be introduced for three countries, namely Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, for the period 2007-2013."
"These measures would consist of a reduction in the VAT call-up rate, which the Presidency has more generally proposed freezing at 0.3%."
"It is clear that before a solution is reached on resources a number of other details still need to be examined, details which are not always minor and are often sensitive."
"Nevertheless, the Presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis for an ultimate agreement, provided everyone has the will to succeed and shows sufficient political will."
"These are the main elements of the latest proposal, which has been distributed to the Member States and will be examined in Luxembourg on Sunday."
"It is the basis for an agreement in the Council."
"It will then be up to the Council and Parliament to translate it into Financial Perspectives in an interinstitutional agreement."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin my remarks by congratulating the Temporary Committee, its chairman and its rapporteur on their outstanding work."
"The accuracy and quality of analysis, coupled with the high quality of debate in the Temporary Committee are indicative of Parliament’s desire to make a positive contribution to this extremely important debate on the Financial Perspective."
"I feel that Parliament’s commitment is crucial, because Europe’s political project is at stake."
"The task now is to translate our political will into financial commitment and I am delighted to see Parliament’s determination and resolve in assessing the resources the Union needs to accomplish its project."
"I am similarly pleased to note that the resolution before Parliament has demonstrated that there is a great deal of convergence between the views of the Commission and Parliament."
"The fact that the Commission and Parliament find themselves on the same wavelength does not come as any surprise to me."
"We have opted to use the same method – that of defining our political project and our priority actions, then deciding on the resources and the appropriate budgetary instrument for these decisions to be put into practice."
"I still believe that this is the most appropriate means of convincing European taxpayers that their money is being used properly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I share Parliament’s conviction that we must all work in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement that embodies the Financial Perspectives."
"As the Presidency representative, whom I greet, has just pointed out, the agreement on the Financial Perspectives is not an agreement between the Member States in the European Council. It is an agreement between our three institutions, which share responsibility for it and each of which has a crucial part in drawing it up."
"This interinstitutional agreement is the expression of a partnership between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"I believe the adoption of Parliament’s position today and the institutional trilogue next Wednesday are key steps along the way to reaching an agreement."
"And I believe it is very important that an agreement is reached soon."
"Even if there are a number of differences, our respective thinking has brought our two institutions to conclusions that are in reality very close."
"I recognise that the resolution Parliament is examining today is full and balanced."
"I very much enjoyed discussing these issues with the Temporary Committee and I also appreciated the frequent contacts I had, even informally, with the President of Parliament."
"I am pleased to find that these conclusions have met with a very broad consensus within the political and parliamentary groups."
"I do not intend responding in detail. I would simply like to underline one major political point at this stage."
"Obviously, we share a common vision of the Union and of its financial resources as a means of action."
"It will be crucial for us, the institutions, to maintain our alliance on the project until negotiations are concluded."
"Given the divergent positions of the Member States, the negotiations which have begun will be very difficult, even if we have every confidence in the Luxembourg Presidency’s ability."
"However, despite the major obstacles I still believe it is both necessary and possible to conclude an agreement in the next few weeks."
"It is necessary because the absence of an agreement would delay the implementation of policies and deprive the citizens of the policies they are waiting for."
"Of course, the political atmosphere today is not necessarily favourable."
"Uncertainty often undermines the willingness to compromise."
"An agreement would, however, demonstrate to our fellow citizens that despite the serious difficulties we are experiencing today, Europe is capable of acting, that it has a project for the future and that it is capable of putting it into effect."
"In other words, we must avoid prolonging a debate that reveals things that could divide us and concentrate on the things that bring us together."
"We must also respond with action to those who think Europe could grind to a halt and fall into paralysis."
"It may seem paradoxical, but I believe the difficulties we are experiencing are also an opportunity to restate our ambition for Europe collectively."
"That is why I am saying that it is even more necessary now that we find a compromise in the next few weeks."
"I am therefore convinced that this agreement is within our reach and that we must seize this opportunity to put Europe back on the rails."
"Mr President, while Parliament is agreeing its position the negotiations in Council continue."
"Today we have a meeting of Ecofin."
"On Sunday we have another ministerial conclave, in which I will be taking part."
"I would like to say a few words on the latest proposals from the Luxembourg presidency."
"I would like to begin by thanking the presidency for its energy and for the determination it has shown and brought to this matter."
"It is fair to say that many dismissed any chance that this negotiation could make much progress, but the presidency has proved them wrong."
"In this respect, I would like to stress the very good cooperation between the Commission and the presidency in the handling of this matter since January."
"For me the crucial test must remain the ability of the proposals to deliver the political goals we have set."
"We cannot fall into the trap of once again letting the gap widen between our political promises and the reality that follows."
"In some areas the presidency has found a way forward."
"On cohesion policy, for example, substantial savings are proposed, but the overall balance remains – a balance between the compelling imperative to commit new resources in the wake of enlargement and the need to respect the fact that the mission of the cohesion policy is to work across the whole Union."
"On own resources, the presidency has shown its well-known pragmatism."
"The proposal made includes the freezing and phased reduction of the UK rebate, and some compensation for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, to take account of their excessive budgetary burdens."
"For the sake of transparency and fairness, let me tell you that this is certainly not the ideal solution."
"As you know, the Commission had proposed a different solution."
"However, the conditions needed to make it viable have not been met and the solution envisaged by the presidency has the merit of preventing this issue from spiralling into real crisis in the coming years."
"That is where we are."
"I do not believe that we can afford to hold the Union’s policies to ransom while we chase the illusion of a better arrangement."
"We must accept that the presidency has found a balanced solution."
"In other areas, however, I must say that, compared with the Commission’s proposals, those put forward by the presidency are disappointing, and sometimes truly problematic."
"If you look at the newer areas of policy – supporting competitiveness for growth and employment, making freedom security and justice more concrete, giving a new impetus to our external policies – these proposals will require the Union to make very real sacrifices."
"This is not about numbers on the page."
"It is about concrete actions which the Union has agreed to take forward and which it will be enabled to realise."
"To take the area of competitiveness for growth first, Heading 1A, we all know that this is mainly about investing in knowledge."
"This effort will be diluted if not backed up by investment."
"Of course, in the context of the overall picture, the increase proposed by the presidency – some 37% on average compared to 2006 – is not insignificant."
"It would still allow investment in our future."
"But let us be honest with ourselves: it would not allow us to meet all of the goals that we have set."
"Turning to other new policy areas, again the increase for freedom, security and justice looks generous on paper, with a proposal to double the 2006 levels."
"However, judged against the policy needs set out in the aid action plan approved by the European Council, the shortfall suddenly looks to be a real problem."
"Hard choices would have to be made if this proposal were accepted."
"As for our external policies, there is a strong consensus that Europe needs to be a more effective and vigorous actor on the world stage."
"But under these proposals we would have to scale down our ambitions drastically."
"Do we cut back on pre-accession, on stabilisation in the Balkans, on neighbourhood policy, on humanitarian aid?"
"At a time when ministers are making a fresh commitment to increase official development aid by EUR 20 billion a year by 2010, frankly I find that troubling."
"So, in those areas we run the risk of failing to fully deliver on our promises and previous commitments."
"I take comfort in the position of Parliament as laid down in the draft resolution today."
"I do not believe that it is impossible to maintain the balance proposed by the Commission, to respect the legacy of the foundation policies while giving a new reality to new policies."
"I look forward to working closely with Parliament in the coming days and weeks with this goal in mind."
"I know that you will agree with me that, if we succeed in reaching an agreement in the European Council next week and in concluding an interinstitutional agreement, we must face up to the consequences."
"It may prove impossible to reach an agreement without trimming our ambitions."
"Let me be clear, once again. We want a consensus for the next European Council."
"We need it."
"But at the same time we have to say no to a cut-price agreement that will mean a cut-down Europe and a cut-down project for the Europe of ambition and solidarity that we want."
"We all need to keep that in mind at a time when we are so keen to try to find a new impetus for Europe."
"As we approach the final stages of the financial perspective negotiations, as we prepare for an agreement that would show how committed we are to making Europe work, strong and positive collaboration between the European Parliament and the Commission is needed now more than ever."
"Together we can make a difference for the benefit of the citizens of Europe."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso."
"It is good news that you are happy with the proposal of the temporary committee."
"Thank you for your positive assessment."
". Mr President, allow me to begin with some words of thanks to the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union and its rapporteur, Mr Böge, as well as to Catherine Guy-Quint in particular."
"Why these thanks?"
"The first reason is a selfish one, because the proposals on Heading 4, which I am defending as the draftsman for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, recommend an increase of EUR four billion."
"In fact, I scarcely dare to say that, because the said amount is actually in line with our vision of a strong foreign policy for the European Union."
"My second reason to be grateful is the report’s proposal that the initiative on democracy and human rights be invested with a clear specific programme to which non-governmental organisations would be able to subscribe independently of the governments of their home countries, and which would be under the exclusive control of Parliament."
"My third, and by no means least, vote of thanks is for bringing the overall budget proposal to 1.18% for commitments and 1.7% for payments, which is close to the Prodi Commission’s proposal."
"We shall achieve neither a unified nor an enlarged Europe without allocating a certain volume of resources."
"The recent elections and referenda are proof of this."
"I am rarely in agreement with Mr Barroso, but I am on this occasion when I simply say to the Council that we have achieved an extraordinary feat of parliamentary democracy in overcoming our national differences, and I urge the Council to bear that in mind."
"Mr President, a much-heard argument against the Constitution in the Netherlands was our excessive contribution to the European budget; why, indeed, should we be the largest net contributor, while four other Member States are richer than we are?"
"With this resolution, we are indicating that a solution must be found – and soon – to our unfair and unequal position."
"We want a proportionate contribution for every country, not just for the Netherlands."
"The Dutch ‘no’ to the Constitution illustrates that things should be different in Europe: not less, but different."
"This goes hand in hand with the budgetary restraint proposed by Mr Böge, which we very much appreciate for that reason."
"This also means that we consider the alternative proposed by the Group of the Greens as too expensive and too supra-European, but nor do I regard the 1% proposed by the six as a justifiable starting point."
"It is not crucial whether the percentage is 1% or 1.07%; what matters is what the money is spent on and what the benefit is of regulating this at European level."
"We do not want a more expensive Europe with more of the same, we want a different Europe, a shared and social Europe."
"Currently, too many European funds are still being channelled to the relatively rich regions, agricultural subsidies account for nearly 45% of the budget, and – as I am sure you are familiar with our position in this respect – we waste EUR 200 million a day on meetings in Strasbourg."
"We must free up more funds for a safer and more social Europe, more cofinancing of agricultural policy by the old Member States and the abolition of agricultural export subsides with immediate effect."
"All of this can generate more funds for a safer and more social Europe. There are currently insufficient funds available for many regions, educational exchanges, including for senior secondary vocational training, knowledge and employment, promotion funds for national plans to create new jobs in regions threatened with delocalisation, vital rural and nature management, border control, security in Europe and the fight against global poverty, which brings me to development cooperation."
"The Commission has suggested lumping development aid, external policy and economic cooperation together, an idea to which Parliament is unanimously opposed; the report demands these to be split up."
"We also demand that the Millennium objectives be given a central place explicitly at the heart of development policy."
"Today, one in five people have no access to basic education and health care."
"We want this to become a central concern in the policy."
"The minimum amounts in the proposals are minimum amounts, 35% of which must be spent on basic education and basic health care."
"If we made those choices, Europe would help make the world a safer place, and Europe could make the difference in terms of this social dimension, both in the EU and elsewhere."
"That is what this House as a whole wants."
". Mr President, like my honourable colleague Mr van den Berg, I shall begin by speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade then go on to speak as the first contributor from our group."
"Let me say, on behalf of the committee, that we cannot but thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for the manner in which the deliberations were conducted within the Temporary Committee."
"Our Committee on International Trade formulated a number of recommendations, which are, I would say, fiscally prudent and therefore all the more acceptable to our Committee."
"I believe that one of the features of our resolution was its emphasis on the importance, in the framework of the WTO negotiations, of ensuring that the Union, through its budget, can render assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in particular with a view to laying good foundations for these negotiations."
"I do not suppose that this is one of the main points of the present discussion, but we nevertheless wish to underline it."
"Now, as one of the speakers from my group – Mrs Buitenweg, our coordinator, will speak on behalf of the group later – I should like to say two things."
"Firstly, the reason why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution is that we felt that, in this game for three players or institutional triangle, the message conveyed by Parliament ought to reinforce that of the Commission and support the Commission’s proposals and that, on some budget items, we should even signal a desire to go beyond the Commission’s proposals while remaining within the limits authorised by the Treaties."
"That is why – and we shall return to this point – we sought to accentuate a number of priorities, especially in the field of rural development and also in the domains of education and culture."
"Secondly, I should also like to address a few words to the Council Presidency."
"It is obviously inappropriate to bombard the Presidency, because we know the Presidency, and we know it is doing its level best, as they say."
"The real targets for criticism are those countries – the members of the one-per-cent club – which want to have their cake and eat it, to put it colloquially."
"From this point of view, we need an agreement, but an agreement at all costs is no solution. In spite of everything, the Commission’s proposal and that of the Council still differ by EUR 150 billion over the seven-year period."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will have its first opportunity tomorrow to react to the uncertainty brought about by the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda."
"Mr Böge’s report is a good report; it is balanced and in keeping with the Prodi Commission’s proposal."
"It maintains an appropriate level of resources for the Union, ensures that regions lagging behind in development will continue to enjoy the support of the Union, aims to penalise no one on the grounds of enlargement, and relies on cohesion but also on competitiveness, by prioritising research and technological innovation."
"Those are the arguments presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which Mr Böge has taken into consideration in his report, and for which I thank him."
"Aside from the improvements that can be made, however, it is important to consider the tangible and symbolic value of Parliament’s approval of this text."
"The positive signals are two-fold: reaching an agreement within the time limits set and, in particular, rejecting the drastic cut in resources demonstrate the will to not give in to the temptation of renationalisation."
"This vote must resonate as a call to next week’s European Council, in order that it reaches an agreement that is as close as possible to our position."
"We do not believe that the Council’s latest proposal is, however, heading in the right direction."
"That is why, as President Barroso states – and I value his statement – a revival is needed, and that, Mr President, is the first crucial decision for such a revival of the Union."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to say that the proposal on which we shall vote tomorrow proposes the internal redeployment of EUR 200 million from the trans-European energy networks to the Social Agenda, which is an essential factor in social inclusion, growth and competitiveness."
"It should also be pointed out that the request to enhance the financial framework of the ‘Progress’ programme so as to pave the way for the effective implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Agenda represents a success for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We now hope – and I repeat this request – that this desire to increase the appropriations does not fall on deaf ears in negotiations with the Council."
"I should also like to mention, however, with some degree of concern, that social dialogue and the free movement of workers, specifically EURES, are not mentioned in this report."
"I believe it is essential that the financial margin in line 1A should be able to bridge that gap."
"Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this issue, however, and in light of Europe’s crucial role in questions of social justice and cohesion, I should like to express my concern at the way in which the Luxembourg Presidency has addressed questions relating to the statistical effect and should therefore like to …"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our environment and our natural resources are scarce assets, and we want to pass them on to our children, if at all possible enlarging them in the process."
"Our budgetary resources are also a scarce asset, and so we must make strenuous efforts to achieve our environmental goals as effectively and efficiently is possible."
"This is the spirit in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety drafted its opinion, and the rapporteur, in his usual courteous and cooperative manner, has incorporated our thoughts."
"For that I am grateful to him."
"These thoughts include not only the observation that European environmental policy has proved to be an effective means of preserving or even improving the environment, public health and people’s quality of life."
"That is the conservationist side of our approach."
"Our thoughts also comprise the realisation and recognition that our environmental policy is also making a significant contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon goals, to job creation."
"That is the innovative side of our approach, and its importance should not be underestimated."
"For this reason, I very much hope that all Members of this House will join us in our present and future pursuit of this strategic path."
". Mr President, first of all, may I beg leave to ask you to extend a return invitation to the Council and the Commission, to Mr Schmit and Mr Barroso, to conduct a trialogue with us here in this House."
"The directly elected representatives of the European people should certainly play a leading role in such negotiations, which should be conducted with the public good in mind."
"Secondly, let me stress that the Commission and the Council have set themselves the objective of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, the goals of which are growth and employment."
"Growth means an increase in net incomes for everyone, whether students, employees or pensioners."
"Growth means an increase in take-home pay at the end of the month."
"How can we achieve that?"
"By creating more jobs, because more employment means, in turn, that more revenue will be available for redistribution."
"This is what makes the Barroso Commission so very socially responsible, and Parliament is one hundred per cent behind its social aims."
"I am therefore curious to discover whether the Council will be prepared, and will be bold enough, to increase the allocation of resources to the Lisbon Strategy, whether we shall see not only a doubling of the research budget but also signs of serious intent to implement it, efforts at making additional resources available as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and efforts in the fields of telecommunications, infrastructure and other areas to ensure that higher net incomes are credited to people’s accounts at the end of the month."
"We should also ensure that savings are made."
"I thank the Council for setting a new standard in the European Union through the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"We should also aim to ensure that the average civil servant’s pay is based on the basic remuneration of MEPs."
"There should also be consistency here between the Council and Parliament and, last but not least, between them and the Members of Parliament."
"There should not be excessively wide disparities."
"Yes, savings have to be made, but on the basis of clear objectives."
". Mr President, Mr Böge has made imaginative use of the temporary committee formula and, for the second time, I congratulate him."
"I have time to make one simple point."
"We share the rapporteur’s dilemma that we cannot provide the resources that will improve the conditions and the lifestyle of our citizen body."
"That will mean that in some areas for which my committee is responsible, we have a diminution of consumer protection and other issues, where we are effectively giving less and asking more."
"Mr Barroso talked about a cut-price Europe and the implications of that destination if we get to it."
"I hope that this is not going to be death by a thousand cuts."
"I believe that we have to keep faith with our citizens and not add to the alienation which many of them feel and which they have expressed in recent weeks."
". Both the current parliament and its predecessors have done a great deal to support the development of trans-European transport networks."
"A smoothly functioning European infrastructure is one of the vital pillars of the Lisbon strategy and an important prerequisite for European economic, geographic and social cohesion."
"Last year, 30 projects were selected – including the Marco Polo and Galileo programmes – that are to be given high priority and corresponding financial support by the Community."
"These 30 priority investment programmes create a network encompassing and linking the fifteen old and ten new Member States; they put an end to bottlenecks, replace missing sections of infrastructure and pay special attention to trans-border sections, in other words, they make the system of European transport networks virtually complete."
"In our experience, projects failed to get under way, or got under way only very slowly in past decades, due among other things to the reluctance of the Community to assist with funding."
"Does the new Financial Perspective change this?"
"Indeed it does."
"The proposed allocations in the framework of the new Financial Perspective enable average Community funding of 15% and, in addition, other innovative forms of financing have been formulated."
"This will enable a new type of financing system to evolve, that is more effective than earlier systems and requires smaller contributions from Member States, for the first time in the history of TENs funding."
"In fact, Community funding will act as a catalyst."
"It is the unanimous view of the temporary committee that the funds allocated should be regarded as the minimum required."
". Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development has, by a large majority, endorsed the Commission’s financial estimates."
"In my opinion, the European regional and cohesion policy is the European Union’s most successful policy by far and the one with the most immediate public visibility."
"In view of the manifest public detachment from European politics at this present time, we should focus on the continued pursuit of this successful policy through the seven-year multiannual programmes and support it with appropriate funding."
"I warmly welcome the proposal made by the rapporteur, Mr Böge, that 0.41% of gross national income be guaranteed for the cohesion policy, and also that the 4% cap should remain in force."
"We also support measures to deal with the special problem of regions subject to the statistical effect and border regions."
"The entire House, of course, is well aware that we are operating with tax revenue. This is why the Committee on Regional Development firmly supports the strict application of the N+2 rule and advocates its extension to the Cohesion Fund."
"European tax revenue must be spent efficiently and not poured down black holes somewhere or other."
"I might add that the Council should take note of the benefits that application of the N+2 rule brings."
"At the same time, though, I should like to say to all those Members who are calling for more money, that the financial pressure on some Member States is extremely heavy."
"This is another area where we need to set reasonable limits."
"This is why the great majority of our committee supports the rapporteur’s view that in some areas the allocation of resources should be cut back or new scope be created for negotiation."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Böge on his balanced report."
"Despite quite a few obstacles right across the agricultural sector, it is a very even-handed document."
"It is European agriculture that makes the multi-annual budget possible, because it is the only sector that is dramatically tightening its belt."
"We will be cutting our budget from 36% to 26%."
"That appears to me to be a huge step forward for all other sectors in order for them to adopt European policy."
"Two obstacles remain."
"We have an agreement from Brussels that prescribes the permitted level of growth in that budget."
"At the same time, I notice that no funds have been set aside for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession."
"Now that European agriculture is cutting back so drastically, I cannot imagine how under the Brussels agreement, Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession can also be funded with those 26%."
"In an extreme situation, it could mean that, since that agreement and the relevant cuts have to be borne by the 15 old Member States, a situation could arise in 2012 where farmers in the 15 old Member States receive 15% less premiums than the farmers in the new Member States."
"Surely that cannot be the case."
"By using partial cofinancing as a solution to this problem, Mr Böge provides the option of fighting fire with fire, although this has been greeted by huge protests in Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture, for, first of all, the very tricky question remains of whether it is legally enforceable."
"Secondly, we greatly value the common market and want to preserve it."
"Whatever happens, cofinancing in compulsory expenditure must not lead to the renationalisation of agricultural policy."
"I have one observation left to make with regard to the Council."
"There is a great deal of talk about net payments."
"Could I advise the Council to deduct the Member States’ own resources from their net payments?"
"That would amount to half of the net payments in my country, and that might well prove the answer to the problem."
"Mr President, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, warm thanks to our rapporteur Mr Böge, who has had the courage to set out unambiguous priorities in his draft report, one – and an explicit one – being in the sphere of education and training, which are key factors in growth, social integration and competitiveness."
"Nor has he limited himself to sounding off on the subject, for he has added almost a billion euros to this draft Budget for the great educational programmes Erasmus and Leonardo and for youth exchanges."
"Although Mr Böge also put the case for an increase for culture, the amount of this falls lamentably short of the amount that is desirable as a matter of urgency."
"Regrettable though this is in view of the frequent invocation of the soul of Europe, I would like, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, to ask the House to back these proposals tomorrow with a large majority."
"Now that the Council has, in the referenda, been sent a clear signal from the public, I call upon it to get its priorities right by accepting what Parliament has proposed through its rapporteur and, in the European Budget, taking public participation particularly seriously, as well as education and culture."
"Before the referenda, 72% of the public described themselves as inadequately or not at all informed."
"It is for that reason that the Council must learn its lesson where the financial situation is concerned."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Böge, and those who collaborated with him for the volume and high quality of their work and for the political vision that inspired their report."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have no complaints."
"Indeed, I am delighted to say that I fully endorse the line proposed by the Böge report on the important domain of freedom, security and justice, which, in both budgetary and structural terms, is recognised and enshrined as one of the EU’s fundamental priorities."
"I note with satisfaction that the Böge report proposes – as I had requested, incidentally – that this area of activity be ‘ringfenced’, as it were, within Heading 3 by the creation of a separate subheading that would guarantee the funding required for its development."
"I am also pleased to see that the report proposes an appreciable increase in the relevant budgetary appropriations, which will serve to intensify the fight against organised crime and against terrorism, to improve the system of controls at the EU’s external borders and to ensure that the common immigration and asylum policies are pursued effectively."
"Lastly – and this is a purely personal point, Mr President, which I make as a Member elected in Wallonia – I wish to say very clearly, in words addressed to the Prime Minister of the Walloon region, Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe, that I wholeheartedly support the call made in paragraph 58 of the report for protection of the legitimate interests of the regions that have been subject to the statistical effect of enlargement."
"This should save Mr Van Cauwenberghe the effort of issuing another blatantly untruthful statement."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which is responsible for the Constitution, has highlighted something that is by now no doubt obvious to everyone, namely that the European Union’s direct communications with, and provision of information to, its citizens is a disaster – not only a disaster but also a communications black hole now threatening to swallow up the European Constitution."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has pointed out that the development in Europe of an area of language and cross-border public participation in political life is necessary and indispensable to European democracy."
"We have noted with regret the fact that one of the Commission’s first actions was to cut back the funds for information about the Constitution, something that would make one weep if it were not so farcical."
"The Temporary Committee and its rapporteur have taken on board the Committee’s concern, albeit without allocating funds to deal with it."
"There is no point in presenting the public with priorities if you do not set aside money for them."
". – Mr President, the Committee on Women’s Rights regrets that the allocations proposed in the ‘Prodi package’ for social issues, equality and employment does not reflect any real increase over the previous financial framework, in spite of the fact that inequalities in the enlarged Europe have increased, that over 20 million people are unemployed and that poverty and social exclusion now affects 70 million people."
"Suitable financing must therefore be made available for the ‘Progress’ programme, greater attention must be paid to the involvement of women in the various programmes and there must be a clear sharing of the actions relating to equality and anti-discrimination policies specifically geared towards promoting women’s rights and involvement, by setting up programmes such as ‘Equality between Women and Men 2013’ and new funding for the new European Gender Institute."
"It should also be noted that equality between men and women must be included in all Community policies across the board and special attention should be given to …"
". Mr President, we are grateful to the rapporteur for the provisional inclusion in his report of one of the most important recommendations made by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It recommended that the highest political authority in a Member State be required, every year, to approve the budget and certify expenditure, both beforehand and afterwards."
"That is important, for it is in the Member States that the key expenses are incurred."
"In addition, we are all aware of the fact that the European Court of Auditors has, for the past ten years, declined to issue a positive Statement of Assurance."
"The second important point that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to make is that, although we have a budget, every year we are well behind in terms of expenses."
"These are known as Commitments Outstanding and we consider it therefore vital that the N + 2 rule should remain in place."
"It is unacceptable for Member States to make advance payments and subsequently for the Commission to be at a loss as to how it can spend them."
". – Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, but I also wish to say, if I may, that I am very concerned that we have had access to a negotiating fund – offered to us, indeed, by the Luxembourg Presidency – which reduced Parliament’s proposal by around EUR 100 000 million."
"This is a drastic reduction that might scupper completely the very basis of defending natural sea resources."
"We must not lose sight of the fact that in this area of the sea we now have to finance external fisheries agreements and to comply with the OSPAR Convention, to which the EU is a signatory, which designates new areas of protection in the ocean."
"There are new proposals to set up satellite mechanisms to monitor fisheries, and these are extremely costly; there are proposals to convert large sections of the fisheries sector; and there is also the enlargement."
"With all of this to contend with, this proposal strikes the Committee on Fisheries as a meagre one that falls well short of meeting what we see as genuine needs."
"We also note that there is a great danger that the Council will decide to cut this proposal altogether."
"This is something that worries us greatly and I should like to implore the Council to take our genuine needs on board."
"I should also like to urge you, Mr Barroso, to maintain the position that you have held thus far of doggedly defending your Commission proposal, because this is what will defend Europe, defend our interests and defend the sea ..."
". Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shares the aims adopted by our Temporary Committee on the basis of the proposals submitted by its rapporteur, Reimer Böge, to whom I wish to pay tribute on behalf of our group."
"Thanks to him, Parliament’s position will be ready on schedule."
"The strong message that emerges from this report is that the Union cannot be enlarged and enhanced without increasing its budget."
"President Barroso has reminded us of that fact."
"In our view, the first key requirement is to fund the policies covered by the Lisbon agenda: the trans-European networks, research, university exchanges and the knowledge-based economy."
"Another key requirement is solidarity: the scrupulous practice of solidarity with our new partners and solidarity throughout Europe with all those who are victims of industrial restructuring or of difficulties arising from geographical factors."
"As far as the funding of the common agricultural policy is concerned, the commitments made to farmers for the period up to 2013 must be honoured."
"If it emerged, however, that needs outweighed these resources, they would have to be topped up by the Member States."
"With or without the Constitutional Treaty, the Council and Parliament have forcibly expressed their common desire to see the economic union transform itself gradually into a genuine political union."
"Our priorities in this context are the war on terrorism and serious crime and the new neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, we are well aware that the overall needs identified by our Temporary Committee fall short of the ambitions of our Parliament."
"Sadly, it is not possible to go any further today without radically reforming the own-resources system."
"It is the wish of our Committee on Budgets to work on this objective in close liaison with the national parliaments."
"We firmly believe that it will be possible to find together the consensus solutions without which the Union will remain permanently unable to finance its political ambitions."
". Mr President, first of all, may I, in turn, thank Reimer Böge and the whole team who, under your chairmanship, have worked hard to ensure that Parliament has a position worthy of its status as a branch of the budgetary authority."
"In this capacity, we sought to formulate proposals designed to bring about economic recovery and intensify European solidarity while preserving the essential building blocks that are already part of the European edifice."
"Conscious of the difficulties experienced by some Member States, we had to produce a transitional Financial Perspective."
"Our negotiations culminated in a very reasonable draft which still contains crucial growth elements."
"Our duty, in fact, is to maximise the value added to national budgets by European intervention and to give Europe the means it requires to implement a project designed to bring progress in which all Member States can share."
"We must remember that, in the long run, expenditure at European level is a source of savings for national governments, particularly because European expenditure permits economies of scale and often enables Member States to make innovations and pursue policies that they could not have done independently."
"With a budget corresponding to 1.07% of GDP in payment appropriations, we shall have the resources to ensure that policies can be implemented in future."
"There has also been a need to break certain taboos."
"I am thinking here of the funding of the common agricultural policy, which will have to be reviewed if necessary in order to establish a fairer expenditure structure."
"I am also thinking of the British rebate, which must be challenged if we are to have a fairer own resources mechanism."
"I am thinking of the Cohesion Fund too, where we must create a transitional mechanism to avoid penalising those Member States that would no longer be eligible for support."
"In addition, all the institutions are called upon to intensify their efforts to achieve economy and efficiency."
"My last point on the payment appropriations is that the two elements of the present proposal are inseparable, namely the 1.7% in payment appropriations and the 24.2 billion for the flexibility instruments that are imperative if we are to develop the policies essential to growth and solidarity in the Union and the world."
"I should also like to emphasise two aspects of the present situation."
"The first concerns our disappointment at having been unable to finance Natura 2000 entirely outside the budget for rural development, to which we attached such great importance."
"The second concerns the demand we Socialists made for the allocation of resources to the European Development Fund, which is an indispensable instrument for the improvement of decentralised cooperation."
"Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that Europe is experiencing difficulties at the present time, which I shall not spell out in detail."
"It has emerged clearly from these recent events that our citizens want a real Europe, a Europe that relates to them and communicates with them."
"This is precisely why it is very important to avail ourselves of this new heading."
"We are undoubtedly struggling today to find a political programme for Europe."
"We have objectives but not enough major projects and too few resources."
"It is essential to respond to people’s expectations, and I address these words directly to the Council."
"It is high time the Council was able to fulfil the hopes of the European peoples."
"There is an urgent need for it to face up to its responsibilities."
"We all need this budgetary framework in order to breathe fresh life into the economy and to regain public trust."
"We must overcome national self-interest and rediscover a mature approach to the European political project."
"There is nothing excessive about our demand, and that is why we are asking the Council to advance towards our position."
"Mr President, I too must greatly commend and warmly thank our rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his thorough and proficient efforts, firstly in analysing the Commission’s proposal and then in formulating Parliament’s position on the financial perspectives."
"My group supports this report."
"This proposed basis for the negotiations with the Council is economically responsible."
"We have found ways of reprioritising under the Commission’s proposal and of making savings in relation to the latter."
"Those of us in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are particularly pleased that the proposal concentrates on research, training and investments in transport and energy."
"It is, of course, precisely in these areas that we must invest significantly more of the EU’s budgetary means."
"It is in such efforts that the future lies, and they can give the EU a position of strength."
"That is why it is all the sadder that it is specifically in these areas that the EU’s Heads of State or Government are considering wielding the axe in order to make cuts."
"They want ruthlessly to cut back on our ambitious research efforts, and this is quite incomprehensible and out of step with the many fine statements from the Council about common research."
"It is precisely from these areas, where common efforts really could strengthen the EU’s competitiveness, that they are withdrawing and are saving amounts that, seen in a larger context, are exceedingly modest. As Commissioner Barroso did of course tell us, such savings will genuinely affect ambitions in this area."
"Those of us in the ALDE Group are particularly pleased about the greater resources Parliament is setting aside for asylum and legal policy and for the common foreign policy."
"Legal policy is a rapidly growing area, and it is important for a large enough framework to be set aside for us to be able to respond to new needs over the next eight years."
"A lot can happen in eight years."
"Foreign policy too is an area in which new needs constantly arise."
"This is shown by experiences in recent years, when we suddenly had to find money for Kosovo, Afghanistan, Serbia and Iraq and, most recently, for the victims of the tsunami."
"The financial framework will have to take account of such sudden needs so that we do not go and cut back on aid to other poor countries."
"We have attached particular importance to there being adequate resources for supporting the enlarged EU’s new neighbours."
"The developments in Ukraine are, of course, the latest example of the EU being able to support democratic developments in countries that are its close neighbours."
"Agricultural policy and support for poor regions in the old Member States will continue to account for a lot of the budget."
"It is therefore necessary for the overall framework to be set high enough for it to be possible to finance new needs too."
"The EU budget still amounts to only approximately one per cent of gross national income, and it cannot be claimed that the amounts we are now debating are going to be the source of a budget crisis in any Member State."
"I wish, therefore, earnestly to call upon the European Council to find a reasonable solution at the forthcoming summit, to break the deadlock and to show that results can be delivered."
"I agree with Mr Böge when he says that we also want Parliament to provide a solution, but not at any price. I want to say, however, that Parliament has come up with a constructive and realistic proposal."
"We are obliged to find a solution so that the structural fund programmes designed to develop the economies of the new Member States can be got under way on 1 January 2007."
"Not to achieve a result and not to display a willingness to negotiate would simply be contemptible."
". Mr President, I have spent the past weeks doing a lot of campaigning on the future of Europe, and, while it is very unfortunate that the referendum in the Netherlands has ended in a ‘no’, this is not, of course, unexpected."
"If year in, year out, the only thing a country gets to hear about Europe is that it costs too much, and that it is a disgrace how much the Netherlands is paying to Brussels, then you can hardly expect people to jump up for joy, shout ‘yes!’, and resolve to accept this Europe with open arms."
"Dutch accountants have sown the euro scepticism that was reaped on 1 June."
"What has the Dutch Government made of it all?"
"It claims that the Dutch ‘no’ is a ‘no’ to our being a net contributor."
"Well, that is, of course, turning the facts upside down."
"To my great horror, this has now suddenly become the position of the Dutch Social Democrats as well, and that is depressing but, of course, a very easy option."
"My group has interpreted the ‘no’ in a very different way."
"Many people did not vote against Europe, but want a better Europe, not a Europe of multinationals, but one of people."
"The Group of the Greens has therefore tabled an alternative resolution, because we want to invest heavily in education, in poverty-reduction projects and in exchange programmes, also for students."
"We want more development cooperation; we want to invest in the Millennium objectives."
"We also want to protect our vulnerable environment by actually freeing up funds; everyone in this Chamber is agreed that these should be made available, but they are not."
"We do not want this reality to prejudice the rural economy."
"We want to spend the money more effectively, not on prestigious but inefficient national showpieces, such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina Street, but, for example, on the railway connection that links up Berlin with Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn or Vienna or Venice with Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest."
"With empty promises alone and no money to back them up, you will only alienate the voter even more."
"You will need to make it clear in what way you want to make your dreams come true."
"That is why we have tabled a resolution."
". Mr President, I have had the opportunity to observe at close quarters the enormous amount of work Mr Böge has put into this report."
"It is not his fault that our group will not adopt this report by a provisional committee, but has allied itself to the minority opinion and is, instead, proposing its own resolution."
"Parliament’s power relations are such that the committee’s report does not correspond to our group’s opinion of future economic frameworks."
"We would have liked there to be greater focus on economic, social and environmental issues, the prevention of unemployment and the fight against poverty, and solidarity with the developing countries."
"We would have liked to see less neoliberalism, less militarisation of the EU, and less harmonisation of laws."
"On the one hand it is justifiable to have the decision on future economic guidelines fit in with the Commission’s and Parliament’s terms of office."
"On the other hand, structural and cohesion funds and agricultural programmes should not be subordinated to mere budgetary frameworks and procedures."
"While, moreover, the notion of temporal coordination was justified with the provisions of the draft EU constitution, there are no longer any grounds for it."
"The French and Dutch nations have rendered that neoliberalist and Euro-nationalist project comatose, and now we only need to switch off the life-support machine."
"Parliament had no inclination to reach a consensus on how future budgets should be financed."
"Our group endorses the system of national contributions, and, above all, contributions based on GNP, and we have no sympathy for euro taxation."
"We want contributions to be charged fairly."
"That is not how things are at present."
"Others pay almost EUR 5 billion to cover the United Kingdom’s contributions, and that country’s rebate is unjustified."
"The grand total for future expenditure is crucial."
"On the one side there is the 1% proposed in the letter drafted by six Member States, and, on the other, Member States worried about structural and cohesion funds are demanding that Union’s internal cohesion and convergence are safeguarded."
"Our group does not share the committee’s view that the grand total for expenditure should be the Commission’s original proposal of something between 1% and 1.14%."
"We consider the Commission’s proposal to be the bare minimum."
"There is a lot of sympathy in our group for those countries that decry the deflationary pressures of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Many members of our group are furthermore worried about the impact EU enlargement will have on the budget."
"It is feared that enlargement will be paid for by the old cohesion countries."
"Regarding agriculture, not everyone understands why we should be making room in the EU budget for other expenditure with joint financing of agricultural expenditure."
"Mr Böge, I am sorry, but just as I was about to speak about the report’s good aspects, my time ran out."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I have every respect for the work carried out by Mr Böge, I have no choice but to say that the draft Financial Perspective is as worthless as the draft Constitutional Treaty, and deserves the same fate."
"This House should reject the draft Financial Perspective, in so doing proving that it understands and shares the views of the majority of EU citizens."
"It would also prove that it respects democratic principles, and that as a mouthpiece for the public, it represents and protects the interests of the latter."
"What is wrong with the draft Financial Perspective?"
"It provides for the use of inauspicious economic indicators and mechanisms, and, in particular, it restricts Member States’ contributions to around 1%."
"Secondly, it stipulates that a high percentage of the budget will be spent on agriculture."
"Thirdly, it provides for modest increases in expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"Fourthly, around 75% of funding for research and development is set aside for highly-developed countries."
"Fifthly, administrative costs have risen sharply and, sixthly, it does not go far enough in liberalising the market in services."
"What will happen if such inadequate solutions are adopted?"
"Firstly, economic problems will multiply rather than being solved, growth will not be boosted or competitiveness increased, and the development gap between Member States will widen instead of narrowing."
"Secondly, social problems will be exacerbated due to the lack of pro-family policies, since the latter boost employment and earnings, and hence promote natural growth."
"There is also a lack of approximation, or rather a growing disparity between the incomes of a small number of rich people and a larger number of poor people."
"Thirdly, the draft Financial Perspective heightens political tensions within the EU rather than lessening them, because it fails to earmark enough funding for new transport and communications infrastructure."
"Fourthly, not enough money has been set aside for external policies and for aid to countries such as Ukraine and Belarus."
"At the same time, we will be unable to deliver on the binding promises made to Turkey regarding EU accession, and this will further complicate our relations with the Islamic world."
"To sum up, we would be acting at odds with the economic and social objectives proclaimed by the EU if we were to adopt the draft Financial Perspective."
"By doing so, we would merely confirm that the EU is run by bureaucrats and technocrats, and we would make no progress towards our goal of global competitiveness."
"The members of the Independence and Democracy Group will vote against this draft."
"It is high time that a debate was held on the need for a new strategy for economic cooperation between the EU Member States."
". Mr President, the Financial Perspective the rapporteur has presented is close to the limits of what we can achieve at this point in time."
"We are currently in an extremely difficult situation."
"Not only has the Council been unable to reach a common position on the ceiling for commitments and payments, but a majority of voters in France and the Netherlands have rejected the Constitutional Treaty."
"The moment of truth has therefore arrived for the incomprehensible Treaty, which fails to make a distinction between legislation and what are sometimes foolish hopes and dreams."
"A variety of grudges against the EU have been heard from certain quarters."
"According to some of the old Member States, the EU is not doing enough to protect their jobs."
"Others say that it is depriving them of their sovereignty and giving them nothing back in return."
"Certain Member States believe that the EU is over-regulating the economy and that it costs too much."
"Others do not wish to give up the privileges they were granted earlier."
"It is the proverbial Polish plumber, whose work is reliable and cheap, who is blamed for the failure of these various approaches."
"Instead of making serious attempts to carry out economic reforms, certain people prefer to use the Polish plumber as a bogeyman to scare children and young people looking for work."
"In reality, what is happening is that some net contributors to the EU budget are applying the old utopian principle of ‘give what you can and take what you need’."
"The result is that there is never enough EU money to go round."
"We are thus debating the Financial Perspective without knowing whether the Council will reach an agreement or whether the largest Member States will take up even less flexible positions."
"Be that as it may, we still have to take some kind of decision."
"We are proposing to vote in favour of the Böge report, albeit in a slightly amended version."
"Firstly, we are opposed to any link between the level of payments and the reform of the own resources system, as the latter shows every sign of turning into an attempt to move even further away from a correlation of Member States’ payments with their revenue."
"Secondly, we do not agree that agriculture should be cofinanced, as this would be the first step along the path towards renationalising agricultural policy."
"Thirdly, it is our belief that it would be more reasonable to continue with current plans for a Financial Perspective covering the period from 2007 to 2013, as this tallies better with the multiannual programmes and the common agricultural policy."
"The EU has functioned and will continue to function without the thousands of Byzantine provisions in the late Constitution."
"In a large number of countries, the public is losing faith in the EU."
"We must ask ourselves whether this does not stem from the fact that the political elite has ignored the very illusions it created."
"After all, is it not an illusion to repeat endlessly the catchphrase of subsidiarity while the welfare state, which is often unnecessarily over-bloated, is close to bankruptcy?"
"Is it not absurd that the very countries that wish to integrate rapidly are attempting to reduce their contributions to the EU?"
"Is the Lisbon strategy not an illusion, and one that is currently being eclipsed by a rabble-rousing war against the free market?"
"Should the blame be placed on the peoples of those countries that have carried out the necessary reforms and, as a result, begun to develop more rapidly and become more competitive?"
"Parliament will do its duty by voting in favour of the Böge report."
"It is now the Council’s turn to adopt a more constructive stance."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the report that we are discussing today addresses budgetary matters, but also – and I would like to emphasise this – political challenges."
"It is these challenges that I should like to focus on."
"I am sure that you are aware that the financial outlook for the coming years depends, among other factors, on whether the European Constitution is approved or not."
"The citizens of two Member States recently rejected the Constitution; other countries have postponed ratification."
"We should now be taking this message on board, rather than making plans for the years to come."
"What the citizens have said to us, loudly and clearly, is that they see the European Union completely differently to what some politicians dreamt up at the negotiating table."
"From the perspective of the financial calculations, Mr Böge’s report is a sensible compromise."
"It clearly expresses the fact that there cannot be more Europe for less money."
"We must, however, respect above all the will of the citizens."
"It is not now a matter of what seems to us here in the Chamber to be reasonable; it is a matter of what is truly democratic."
"I believe that the rejections of the Constitution cannot be arrogantly ignored."
"I therefore consider that the greatest political challenge is for politicians to have the courage to step forward humbly before the citizens and openly admit that a general consensus on the level of political integration within the European Union simply does not exist at present."
"Accordingly, I ask whether we now even have the right to vote on a report that seeks to create a framework for the political and economic life of the European Union for several years to come, and my answer is a definite ‘no’."
"Mr President, the European Commission’s proposal represented a commitment to enlargement and, at the same time, to its aspirations to turn our economy into a centre of growth and development, to overcome the technological gap with the United States, to increase our presence on the world stage and to confront the new challenges of terrorism and organised crime."
"And this is despite the fact that the proposed distribution of the costs of enlargement is neither fair nor balanced, as demonstrated during the parliamentary debate, and that is why we have presented an amendment that I hope will be supported by a majority of the House tomorrow."
"While I applaud the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency, I must express my concern about the direction of some of its proposals, which tend to please the Member States whose attitude is the least flexible to the detriment of others."
"The Council would do well to take account of the clear signals being sent by the European Parliament, particularly with regard to cohesion policy."
"We want sufficient funds, we want the reuse of funds left over from the convergence objective by the countries with the greatest capacity for absorption, and I hope that tomorrow we will approve an amendment calling for political compensation for those countries and regions suffering a sudden loss of funds."
"Mr Schmit’s fine words, for which we are certainly grateful, must be translated into a clear commitment to cohesion."
"Thinking realistically, I believe that we all agree that the Union currently lacks political leadership, but what will be put to the test on the 17th is the ability of the Heads of State or Government to do their duty."
"And it would be profoundly irresponsible on the part of the Council not to reach an agreement at this time."
"Mr President, as is customary in this House, I shall begin by congratulating Mr Böge on the work he has done on his important report on policy challenges and budgetary means of the Union 2007-2013."
"I shall firstly make a few general comments."
"The financial perspectives that the report refers to unquestionably come within an adverse context, from political, economic and social points of view, in several Member States, and I can only lament the fact that this context has –– if you will allow me to use the expression –– poisoned the debate in committee from the outset, focusing this debate on trying to find an agreement on percentages between the Commission and the Council."
"At times there have been squabbles over percentages, net contributors and net incomes."
"I believe that this is a false debate, from an economic point of view, because it is partial; and politically it is even more partial, because there is much more to the European Union than simply its budget."
"The citizens want much more than a mere accounting exercise, because the Union should be a complete political project, a vision for its citizens and a future for twenty-five countries, which means more than merely being contributors."
"I regret that the current political situation has not allowed Parliament to be more audacious, and this is the first time that Parliament’s proposal has aimed lower than the Commission’s proposal."
"Nevertheless, having said that, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will support the Böge report, since, in the majority of cases, its fundamental demands are taken up."
"Firstly, it confirms the cohesion policy as an indispensable instrument for promoting territorial, economic and social cohesion and reducing the disparities between the regions of the Union — a policy of solidarity par excellence — and sees a proper funding of 0.41% of GDP as condition."
"Secondly, it makes the political and social agenda a priority and recognises that sufficient funding of it is crucial, and consequently it calls for an increase of EUR 200 million in order to achieve its objectives."
"Thirdly, it insists on the need for a sufficient level of funding for external measures, with a view to making the Union a genuine global interlocutor."
"And finally, it takes up the European Parliament's long-standing demand that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports this balanced and realistic resolution, because we are aware that a unified majority position puts Parliament in a strong position when dealing with the Council."
"The ball is in the Council’s court, and it must also bear in mind that the Socialist Group sees the report as a to guarantee sufficient resources for European policies for the Europe of twenty-five."
"Mr President, like many other Members, I should like to congratulate our honourable colleague Reimer Böge for the work that has been done and for his coordination of all this work."
"I also believe it is fair to say, Mr Böge, that many other Members of this House have shown responsibility and diligence in arriving at the two-thirds majority to which you referred before."
"I therefore invite you, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, to listen very carefully to this appeal from our Parliament, because it contains positions that are judicious in two main respects."
"Firstly, they are financially judicious, because, as has been partially explained in the course of this debate, they reflect an entirely satisfactory compromise on both the expenditure and the revenue side."
"On the expenditure side, we have managed to make proposals with the potential to curb expenditure in a number of areas, while on the resources side, as a previous speaker indicated – I think it was a Council representative – there will be increases ranging from about 8 to 15% in the final analysis, depending on the items, if I recall the figure that was quoted a short time ago."
"These, I repeat, are financially judicious positions."
"Secondly, our positions are politically judicious too, on the one hand because the wishes expressed in this Financial Perspective are consistent with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives and on the other hand because those of our fellow citizens who want to take the trouble to fathom out the content of this Financial Perspective will find in it, I believe, a manifestation of our will to enhance our regions while improving our ability to master the challenges of the future."
"This is why I am pleased with the positions adopted by Parliament on the Böge report and why I call on the Commission and the Council to take heed of it."
"In addition, it is my fervent wish that we should be listened to by the Council on 17 and 18 June and that our views receive a favourable hearing."
"It is absolutely essential that the Council’s conclusion on this matter should not be seen as a patched-up decision but rather as a giant step forward towards our vision of Europe."
"Mr President, there can be few subjects closer to a Scotsman’s heart than money and, as the only Scots representative on the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives, I have watched the often Kafkaesque debates with much interest – even when the real debate appears to be happening elsewhere."
"However, the time for debate, in this House at least, is almost over."
"It is the duty of this House to unite around this compromise so ably drafted by our rapporteur, because within the Council, where the real debate is taking place, the ‘one per cent club’, so ably led by the United Kingdom Government, continues to hold the whip hand."
"It is not the perfect compromise – what compromise is?"
"However, we must send it to the Council with as strong a voice as possible."
"I echo Mrs Krehl, my colleague on the Committee on Regional Development, when she says that regional policy is the most successful and most visible aspect of the Union’s work to the citizens in whose name we carry out all our activities."
"The view of the Temporary Committee protects regional policy, and a strong European regional policy which must be promoted and protected."
"It grieves me that the United Kingdom shows every sign of continuing its mean-spirited, shortsighted stance within the Council."
"It is incumbent upon us in this House to send a clear message to the ‘one per cent club’ today that we will not tolerate anything less than this compromise."
"We have heard high hopes from the Council that a deal remains hoped for."
"I myself would not put any money on it any time soon."
"It is for us to unite around the best deal possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my respect for the rapporteur and for his thoroughly ambitious effort that we are debating in this House today. Although the report contains many good individual measures, I am unable to vote in favour of it."
"The reason why my group has tabled its own motion for a resolution is that we wanted to take a different political course in the period from 2007 to 2013."
"The principal reason for my negative response to the Böge report is that the European Union is not equal to the enormous challenges it must face with the next Financial Perspective."
"If we are to consider what needs to be done in society, the economy and the environment – particularly dealing with the demands made by regional cohesion, the high unemployment figures, poverty and income inequality – then we need to do so in a macro-economic context."
"There is no trace of that in this report."
"Generally speaking, we do not think that the upper limits proposed by the Commission for the Budget go far enough."
"Its plan for giving the European Union more and more powers and responsibilities without, at the same time, allocating to it the financial resources it will need to realise them is quite simply not workable."
"We regard the prioritisation of competitiveness, security and defence at the expense of cohesion, of the social and environmental dimension and of cooperation with developing countries as unacceptable."
"This Financial Perspective reflects the attempt at implementing the Lisbon strategy, and we expressed our opposition to the present form of the latter when it was debated."
"It is full employment and sustainable economic development that should instead be the strategic goals, and that means allocating additional financial resources to innovation, social needs and education in particular."
"A reduced contribution of 0.41% of Europe’s gross domestic product will not make a strong European regional policy happen."
"I hope that the Council will now not delay in reaching a decision, for, if it fails to do so, we can already reckon with the impossibility of proper allocation of new assistance funds at the beginning of 2007, and this would be politically irresponsible."
"Mr President, we now again face proposals to increase EU expenditure and, thus, income."
"The argument is that the EU is growing and so must cost more."
"The EU is growing both in terms of its number of Members and due to the fact that different tasks are constantly being taken over from the Member States."
"Is this a sensible development?"
"The obvious answer is no."
"The European countries that fulfil the membership requirements must of course be welcomed."
"There are, however, neither rational reasons nor popular support for moving further political tasks from the Member States to Brussels."
"On the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity, to which general homage is paid but which is never respected, requires a great many powers to be moved back from the EU institutions to the national parliaments."
"The fact that this is the will of our peoples is evident from the referenda in France and the Netherlands and from what we know about public opinion in many other Member States."
"Right now, we are seeing the end of an era in the EU’s history, the end of the era in which the political elite could move further ahead with its ambitions and plans without concerning itself with the will of the people."
"That this was previously possible has to do with the fact that the structure of the parties in Western Europe reflects the issues of political controversy in the 20th century, arranged on a scale from right to left."
"With few exceptions, the established parties are entirely in favour of a continuous shift of political power from the parliaments of the Member States to Brussels."
"Thus, people cannot, in general elections to their parliaments, state that they are opposed to this development."
"In referenda on EU issues and sometimes in elections to the European Parliament, the opportunity arises for the peoples of Europe explicitly to adopt positions on the role the EU should play."
"They then take the opportunity to say no to the shift in power."
"It is important for us to bear this in mind now that we are debating the EU budget for 2007-2013."
"There is no popular support for increased expenditure in an EU in which just over 70% of the budget goes on agricultural policy and the regional funds."
"We register a reservation against the temporary committee’s proposal for the financial perspectives, amounting to 1.07% of gross domestic income in payment appropriations and 1.18% in commitments."
"We believe that, in accordance with the G6 countries’ proposal, the total payment appropriations should fall within one per cent of the EU countries’ total gross domestic income."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Böge on his ability to create a synthesis from the various trends that emerged, and, therefore, for the fine work carried out."
"I would also like to make a brief observation on the trilogy of Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The first two advocate keeping the commitment appropriations at the current level or slightly less (1.18% and 1.24%)."
"In contrast, the Council defends the prerogatives of the Member States, which are worried – and are even more so after the votes of France and the Netherlands on the Constitution – about the unrest gripping the Union like a vice; they delude themselves that, by reducing the funds, they can protect their respective positions, which are exposed to the dangers represented by China, India, the United States, global revolution, competitiveness and innovation."
"Ours is a composite society, which lives beyond its means and which is increasingly at risk as a result of inflexible institutions, a government with limited sovereignty and a soulless Central Bank."
"Reducing the interventions now instead of increasing them, as in my opinion is necessary ..."
"Mr President, the Soviet Union had a total of 10 economic plans."
"The European Union, for its part, has already had four budgetary plans: the Delors I and Delors II packages, the Santer plan and now the Barroso plan for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"The Soviet plans, however, were designed to build up the economy, whereas the European budgetary plans are balancing mechanisms in which flies’ eggs are weighed on spiders’ webs."
"Our debate illustrates this: the 311-page Böge report is essentially all about whether 450 million Europeans will commit appropriations amounting to 1.24%, 1.06% or 1.7% of GDP, in other words whether we shall spend EUR 1 024 billion, 870 billion or 825 billion over the next seven years while the United States spends USD 20 000 billion, some 20 times as much as the EU, over the same period."
"To put it another way, our divergences of some EUR 60 billion between Juncker and Barroso or between Chirac and Böge are equivalent to 0.3% of the US public expenditure estimates for the same period."
"When we have more than 20 million unemployed and 50 million people living in poverty, it is obvious, and has been common knowledge since the time of Pericles, that the big issue is that of large loans for major investments, such as investments in our railways."
"If Brussels had actually been building railway stations, for example, instead of constitutional castles in the air, the European Union would not have been shunted into the sidings."
"Mr President, the way things stand it would be naïve to expect the new Financial Perspective to be based on the same principle as the EU’s previous spending plans."
"The latter had nothing in common with the old Soviet five-year plans, as their guiding principle was that we should have a growing budget to meet our growing needs."
"One could be forgiven for expecting the same to apply today, given that relatively poor countries have joined the EU."
"There has also been a sharp increase in the number of farmers eligible for direct payments, even though such payments were not their idea."
"Finally, our tasks have multiplied, which also has a measurable impact on the budget."
"If this principle were indeed expected to apply again, it would undoubtedly act as another driving force behind the far-reaching political reforms currently under way in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I am quite sure that the political classes of the ‘old’ EU Member States would be hard pushed to carry out even some of these reforms."
"At the same time, however, we must face the facts, which are as follows. The proposed compromise bequeathed to us by the Prodi Commission is indefensible."
"Mr Böge has put an enormous amount of effort and good will into a proposal amending this compromise, and the relative weight it accords to the various budget headings is appropriate."
"No one would dispute the fact that we should use public funds to promote research and development and a knowledge-based economy, but there is not yet any evidence that this is an effective way of spending money."
"It follows that such funding should not be provided at the expense of regional and cohesion policy, which is both visible and of proven benefit, and which does not pit the old and the new cohesion countries against each other."
"This House must make it abundantly clear tomorrow that we are expecting agreement to be reached at government level."
"Europe needs evidence that it still functions."
"The European summit will be an opportunity to furnish such evidence in the form of a sensible compromise."
"Mr President, may I begin by saying that Reimer Böge has done a really good job with this report."
"He has managed to reflect the position of the committee faithfully."
"Not everyone will agree with the full contents of the report, but overall it is very good and he is to be congratulated."
"Different views are represented in this House, whether it be on agriculture, structural funds or whatever."
"You cannot please all of the people all of the time, but that is not such a bad thing."
"You have not pleased us, because, as you would expect, the main point of departure for the British Labour delegation is the implied reference to the United Kingdom rebate."
"In this part of the debate I seem to be a voice in the wilderness, but I will carry on."
"I refer to recital N, which I totally disagree with, and also to paragraph 8 and the fifth indent of paragraph 51."
"I have always made it clear in the temporary committee that own resources and the Financial Perspective are two separate issues, and never before has there been an attempt to link them under any of the previous IIAs."
"That is why the British Labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report."
"The report will certainly give Parliament a good starting point for negotiations with the Council, which I welcome."
"Of course, until we know Council's agreed position, if there is one, it is difficult to say how those negotiations will go."
"I suppose it is still possible in theory that the Council will agree with Parliament's figures, or even go higher."
"Some of us live in hope."
"However, from the beginning when Members raised the issue of linking the Financial Perspective with a new system of own resources, I have used the phrase ""get real"" on at least three occasions."
"We have to ‘get real’ about what the Council will do."
"This is not going to happen."
"In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency, for all its skilful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package, if indeed the Council has a position."
"I personally believe that the present own resources system is opaque and we need something more transparent, so that taxpayers can understand how the EU is financed."
"That discussion and decision will take place in a different House at a different time."
"I know that will not please colleagues in my Group, but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies."
"If the British delegation abstains on this report, it is for the reason that I have outlined."
"As for the future, I wish you well when you start the conciliation negotiations."
"Thank you Mr Wynn. I will pass on your warm remarks to Mrs Thatcher."
"Mr President, one of the comments Mr Böge made during the presentation of his first-rate report was that it was about a forward-looking Europe."
"In my opinion, this is a splendid phrase."
"It serves as a common ground for Parliament and the Commission, and highlights the distance between these two institutions and the Council, which at present is incapable of transcending national interests and finding the answer that Europe needs."
"The European project is currently at crisis point."
"The only response to this crisis has to be the good news that Europe is capable of looking to the future with hope, and that Europe itself can be the source of such hope."
"The Böge report indicates, and rightly so, that there is no contradiction between the European Union’s policies of cohesion and solidarity and Europe’s economic competitiveness."
"This is an important point, and I believe that it is equally important for the Financial Perspective to be a driving force behind European integration, rather than a factor widening the gap between the new and the old Member States, or between Eastern and Western Europe."
"The countries that have rejoined Europe are particularly vulnerable, and this is something people need to understand."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Böge for his high-quality work in the Committee."
"Although we have already heard praise from many quarters for the balance of the work he has done, we – and I – take the view that the failure to put sufficient emphasis on some areas is precisely the problem."
"I want to pick up right now on what Mr Geremek said."
"Is the policy that we are now engaged in devising really sufficiently focussed on the future?"
"What are we in fact doing for the European public, and what can they then do for Europe?"
"I feel at a deep level that, after the two failed referenda, we have to consider how, as a matter of policy, we can communicate better with the people of Europe."
"I believe that our educational programmes, despite the boost that they have already given us, have not taken us as far as we have to go in terms of the Lisbon strategy; over the coming years, by means of the Financial Perspective, we must do everything possible to ensure that every schoolboy, every schoolgirl and every student can gain an education and study in another European country."
"They will relate emotionally to Europe, to its diversity and to its opportunities, in a quite different way, and it is thus that we develop convinced Europeans from the ground upwards."
"Those are the sort of networks we need."
"The situation is exactly the same as regards cultural policy."
"We are so proud of the fact that the Wall is no longer there and that we are a continent of diverse cultures."
"The Budget estimate still falls short of what we spend on subsidising tobacco."
"We need to be visibly proactive here, enabling town-twinning schemes to flourish, enabling artists to meet each other and enabling people to have a real experience of Europe’s cultural riches."
"That is why the estimates contained in Mr Böge’s proposal do not go far enough."
"Let us, together, be bold in trying to get the message across to people, not only to their minds, but also to their hearts."
"– Mr President, Mr Böge’s report setting out Parliament’s position on the Community’s financial framework for 2007-2013 is in fact less favourable than the Commission’s proposal, which was in itself woefully inadequate in terms of financial resources and was out of step with the actual needs of the enlarged Union."
"Both proposals, at their core, are tantamount to surrendering to the strategy pursued by the wealthy countries, such as Germany, which seeks to reduce the Community budget as far as possible. This, let me stress, did not happen in the case of previous enlargements."
"These proposals neither protect nor safeguard the interests of cohesion countries such as Portugal, which may once again be penalised by the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, despite warnings that it would be the country that stood to suffer the most from the enlargement."
"Given that what we actually need to do is to strengthen economic and social cohesion, we have tabled practical proposals."
"These proposals include complete compensation for regions, such as the Algarve, affected by the so-called statistical effect, a specific programme targeted at Portugal and Greece to adjust their economies in light of the impact of the enlargement, an end to the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, the rejection of renationalising the costs of cofinancing the common agricultural policy, the promotion of a fairer model for distributing agricultural aid, the guarantee of a seven-year financial framework and the creation of a Community programme for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the least-favoured regions that depend on that sector."
"These proposals were, to our dismay, rejected by Parliament’s Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective."
"– After the fall of the Iron Curtain, we in the Czech Republic had to wait a disproportionately long 14 years before our citizens could decide in a referendum whether we wanted to join the European Union."
"They said ‘yes’."
"At that time, we agreed to humiliating conditions attached to accession, in which our highly efficient farming sector was granted only a quarter of the subsidies compared with our competitors in the old European Union countries, as well as conditions conflicting with the founding principles of the European Union – protection regulations preventing the free employment of our citizens in many of the old countries of the Union."
"We also find that services may not be directly provided in the old Member States, and we recently discovered how tricky it will be for businesses that logically wish to relocate – still within the EU – to our country with its highly qualified and industrious workforce, which works 40 hours per week rather than 35 and which does not demand exorbitant wages."
"Indeed, it has only taken a year for us to be disabused of many naïve ideas."
"We want to believe at least in the basic promises that led our citizens to say ‘yes’ in the accession referendum."
"The promises were about financial resources, which, they said, would provide funds for the development of the Czech Republic as they had done before in Portugal, Ireland and elsewhere."
"It is therefore logical that we support the Commission’s proposal to maintain the 1.24%."
"Let me make clear that we are not against cuts."
"We are, alas, well aware that the cuts will only come at the expense of funds."
"Nevertheless, the administration of the Union will not become any cheaper: on the contrary, the dream of a European foreign minister, the dream of embassies, the more than 3000 opaque regulatory and advisory bodies, and the all-penetrating regulations set out in twenty languages will make operating the Union more expensive."
"We all know where there are huge amounts of money from which savings can be made."
"The common agricultural policy, for example, pointlessly fritters away more than 40% of the budget, but is well known to be a politically untouchable entity, which Parliament, absurdly, is not even allowed to discuss."
"Only the funds remain to be cut."
"During the year, we have already learnt that the most frequently used magic word is ‘sustainable’, which is used without thinking to label all concepts."
"If we really wish to create a sustainable budget, one that does not lead to further disillusion ..."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a convinced pro-European, but equally as an Italian Member who is also here to represent and defend the interests of her nation, I find the Juncker proposal, setting the paltry sum of 1.05% of GDP for the contributions of the Member States to the European budget, to be unacceptable."
"In the case of Italy alone, which is a net contributor to the European Union, that means an annual cut of around EUR 8 billion, reducing the funds allocated to employment and justice to the bare bones, and cancelling almost half of the funds for research, innovation and trans-European networks, not to mention the Lisbon Strategy."
"There are too many cuts and too many contradictions."
"The so-called UK rebate also needs to be reviewed."
"In actual fact, this exception, the privilege that sees Great Britain obtain a rebate of a substantial proportion of the contributions it makes, must be scrapped."
"It is a provision sought by Mrs Thatcher – in 1984, if I am not mistaken – that was unfortunately, and inexplicably, reconfirmed during Mr Prodi’s presidency: a rebate that is mostly paid for by France and by Italy."
"To conclude, the Juncker proposal is the umpteenth demonstration of the profound distance that exists between European bureaucracy and the real needs of the European people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this context too, I am happy to reiterate that it is not appropriate to top up financial resources at a time when globalisation is, from Europe’s point of view, turning into a trap rather than a dream."
"This 1% will be a solution, and we will manage with it, for we are far from exhausting the possibilities for budgetary rigour, and we should press for the progressive introduction of as many administrative branches as possible having their efficiency and economy evaluated by independent and international consultancy firms, thereby highlighting areas where improvement is needed."
"That was the gist of my Amendment 357."
"The rapporteur was against it, and it is not in the report; not even that is to be permitted."
"You cannot be surprised that most of the people out there are saying ‘no’ to this EU and to this wastefulness, even if – as I do – they say ‘yes’ to Europe."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank our colleague, Rainer Böge, for the work that he has done on this report."
"I greatly appreciate it and I do not believe that anyone else would have done a better job and produced such an excellent and impartial report."
"Tomorrow Parliament must send a strong and positive message to the citizens of Europe."
"We need to have as large a majority as possible back this report."
"If Parliament stands united on this issue, we will also be sending a strong message to the Council."
"Unity in the matter of financial frameworks is still achievable during Luxembourg’s presidential term, if there is the political will and leadership."
"I would like to raise two matters which I think are important: the future of agriculture, and the Baltic Sea."
"Agricultural policy has inevitably got to the stage where agricultural subsidies to the old 15 Member States will be reduced with future enlargements."
"We have to prepare ourselves properly for this."
"I support the amendment tabled by my group which proposes that, if the Council decides to reduce overall funding of compulsory expenditure, the 2002 Brussels agreement notwithstanding, the Member States will have to compensate for this reduction financially."
"In this connection it nevertheless needs to be said that switching to joint financing of agriculture will be a realistic move, if not for this financial perspective, then at least for those to follow."
"I also wish to turn your attention to the amendment that concerns the Baltic Sea strategy."
"At present, the Union has a Mediterranean Sea strategy, and in parallel with that we want now to establish a Baltic Sea strategy."
"This strategy will be especially important for nature conservation."
"Today the Baltic Sea has immense problems."
"When conditions are at their worst you cannot bathe or fish in the sea, and we need effective measures to restore the Baltic to its natural state."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Perspective outlines the scope of the EU’s activities over coming years, as well as providing a framework for such activities and determining how effective they will be."
"There are major tasks ahead of us."
"We want to ensure that enlargement is successfully completed, to lay the foundations for rapid growth and job creation and to achieve the new goals established during the debates held while the European Constitution was being drafted."
"The Financial Perspective must meet these expectations."
"We all want more Europe, because we believe that the creation of a common Europe is the right answer to the challenges we face today."
"Two opposing approaches and ways of thinking emerged during work on the Financial Perspective."
"The first, advocated by the Commission, provides for an ambitious but balanced increase in expenditure, which would keep pace with growing expectations."
"The second, backed by a group of Member States, consists in cuts to the budget as a percentage of GDP."
"We are fully aware that although the EU’s remit has expanded, it must deliver on this remit at a time of severe budgetary restrictions and weak economic growth."
"Under no circumstances, however, should these restrictions make us blind to the unquestionable benefits that may be gained from measures funded from the common EU budget."
"It follows that a compromise is necessary, and an eminently sensible one is set out in Parliament’s proposal."
"If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Böge for the effort he has put into drafting this report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands mean Europe now needs clear confirmation that integration is and will continue to be our common future."
"I would therefore call on the Council to reach a compromise, to abandon selfish and conservative attitudes and to go beyond the narrow confines of purely national interests."
"The reason I call for a compromise is that the European Union is in urgent need of a clear vision of the future and the financial capacity to take action."
"We should work together to demonstrate that Europe is capable of acting in a spirit of solidarity, and that its political leaders are able to rise above short-term political interests and reach agreements for the common good."
"Mr President, I too should like to reiterate our thanks to Mr Böge, and I think it appropriate that his report mentions not only the EU’s expenses but also, in a number of paragraphs, the need for the revision of the own-resources decision; unlike some other speakers, I take the view that it is completely undeserved that one country should be entitled to a correction mechanism every year, while that is not the case for other countries that are in the same situation."
"There are a few key points I should like to mention."
"I am in favour of cofinancing agricultural expenses for the reasons mentioned in the report."
"I am opposed to renationalisation."
"We must have the same rules across Europe, but Mr Böge’s proposals are acceptable."
"Flexibility is also a useful tool in the budget, not only in the items themselves but also with regard to cofinancing percentages of structural aid."
"It may well be the case that richer countries have a higher cofinancing percentage than poor countries."
"The role of the European Investment Bank should be enhanced in structural expenses and so should that of the European Investment Fund."
"We can draw on good examples from the past."
"Finally, there is one more point I should like to make about common foreign and security policy."
"I take the view that those expenses should also fall completely within Parliament’s competence."
"It should not be simply up to the Council;"
"Parliament must approve them as well."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Böge, has done a good job."
"When introducing this report, he pointed out that the Budget leaves certain areas of policy and the economy chronically underfunded."
"Rural development is threatening to become one of them."
"In consequence of a Council decision, funding is tied up until 2013 in the first pillar, where, however, resources are inadequate for funding Romania and Bulgaria."
"It is for this reason that the report proposes the introduction of cofinancing in the first pillar."
"While our group wishes to support this cofinancing, our aim in doing so is to achieve better funding for matters covered by the second pillar."
"The funds from Natura 2000 must be mobilised."
"In the second pillar, rural development must be funded on an equal basis, that is to say with 75% from the European Union, and the proper economic development of rural areas must be guaranteed."
"Far from this being a financial act of mercy, the overall health of our economic development is dependent on rural areas not being left behind."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the voice of the citizens for a more social and more democratic Europe is growing, unfortunately the Council and the Junker Presidency are going backwards, with six countries holding a gun to the others' head."
"They are calling, at any cost, for a compromise to the lowest common denominator."
"They are abandoning the ambitious targets for the future of European unification."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the philosophy of an agreement 'at any cost' which also permeates the Böge report, because it results in less Europe and greater inequalities and has as its victims the weaker countries and the weaker social groups."
"Europe and the Council should, at long last, understand that there cannot be more and a bigger European Union with less money."
"The European United Left considers the Commission proposal to be a totally inadequate starting point for financing the objectives of cohesion and the social agenda following enlargement."
"Any thought, therefore, of further reduction is incomprehensible as far as we are concerned."
"In the name of the European United Left, I call for a fair division of the costs of enlargement."
"Not for the poorer countries and regions to pay most."
"For the unacceptable scandal of the British exemption to end."
"We are all equal."
"For the injustice against the 16 regions which are victim of the so-called statistical effect to be addressed fully and positively and for stronger support to be safeguarded during the transitional period of the regions which have not yet completed the convergence process themselves."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Böge on his report and especially his highlighting of the importance of investment in research and development with a view to meeting the Lisbon Agenda objectives."
"The report also recognises, and rightly so, that education and training should be prioritised in the funding proposed and I believe that the allocation of resources to the development of human capital is vital for long-term investment in the Union’s future."
"I do not share the rapporteur’s recommendations relating to the common agricultural policy and I cannot support his suggestion to introduce co-financing of the CAP."
"This, as I have said on numerous occasions, is something that has never been, is not and never will be acceptable to those of us who are committed to defending farmers with small- and medium-sized farms and our rural communities."
"We should be under no illusion that in time co-financing of the CAP will inevitably lead to its renationalisation."
"Mr President, in practice Parliament’s line on the EU budget shows no evidence of solidarity with the Commission, and this is a great shame."
"We spend a lot of time in this House talking about a strong EU that would compete with the USA or Asia, yet a strong EU with a small budget is inconceivable, not to say absurd."
"It needs to be stated in plain terms that the Temporary Committee’s proposal would leave us worse off than that put forward by the Barroso Commission."
"It is, however, a vast improvement on the Luxembourg Presidency’s so-called compromise, which was doomed to failure."
"If the richest EU Member States insist on imposing their opinion on everyone else, the end result will be that the vision of a common Europe, based on solidarity, is shattered."
"If our aim is to build a Europe of selfish and personal interests, we should go ahead and support a small EU budget."
"The other possibility, of course, is that the real proposal being put to the new EU Member States is for the enlarged EU to be a Europe of solidarity only in terms of duties."
"The opposite would apply as far as privileges are concerned, especially those of the financial variety."
"I should like to make one final point. It is better for financial perspectives to be agreed over a seven-year period, as has been the case to date, rather than a five-year period."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what do our discussions about the next financial framework boil down to?"
"They are in essence about the tasks that we have to perform at European level."
"When the Commission’s proposal is along the lines of doing what it does already, and then some new things on top, then it is making matters too easy for itself."
"What our rapporteur deserves a great deal of credit for is the way he has gone into the details, taking a look at the tasks – including those connected with the Budget – that we in the EU will have to get to grips with in the 21st century, at where more resources are needed – in foreign and security policy – and at where the Commission’s proposals are excessive and we can make cutbacks."
"What we have here, as a result, is an excellent proposal, and one that will serve as a basis for very serious negotiations with the Council."
"A European Union that defines itself solely in terms of the redistribution of as much money as possible is not the European Union I want to see; there are other tasks that we have to perform together."
"If we require the Member States to consolidate their budgets in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot at the same time go around dispensing largesse the length and breadth of Europe."
"This is a task we have to face up to together."
"If you say – as Mrs Trüpel, being a Green, does – that 70 cents for culture cannot be excessive if you set it against the expenditure on the Millennium Goals and all the other goals, then your payments end up amounting to 1.19%."
"What the Greens are proposing, then, is to commit 1.29%."
"If that is what you want, then I suggest that you tell the people that there is no money left at the national level, but Europe is spending more, and see where that gets you."
"Our credibility depends on our concentrating not only on the political tasks in hand – and that is how we respond to the referenda – but also on the Budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is success in the European Union, it is in community, in cooperation, in a common interest in the ongoing development of the kind that is before us."
"We have to consider how we are going to deal with what we face in the years to come, and the public are watching us closely as we do so."
"What do our actions do for our credibility?"
"We know that there are tasks awaiting us that will call for courage and a pro-active approach, that will require that we spell out the fact that this European Union is an economic community with an interest in success."
"While the consequence of this is that we have to invest in the future by stepping up research and improving education and training, we also have to take care that, in this economic community geared to economic success, people and regions are not left behind, and so there is also a need for assistance for those who may, in the course of these changes and developments, have got into difficulties or are already living under problematic circumstances."
"It is there in this report."
"It is because the report that Mr Böge has presented specifically aims to set out guidelines for this and to make available the resources that we need that we are prepared to support it, but the public also expect their representatives – for such is what we are – to think not only about how to spend money where necessary, but also about the supply side; in other words, they want to know where the money is going to come from."
"It is, after all, the public who have to foot the bill for all this."
"It must therefore be acceptable to ask at European level whether the burden of these tasks is equally shared."
"It is quite clear that nothing now justifies the British rebate."
"We all have to go out and show the people of Europe, in all our countries, that we are ready and willing to make the necessary funding available."
"At the same time, we are ready and able to ensure that the resulting burdens are shared out fairly and in a spirit of solidarity."
"Solidarity means not just joining together in sharing out resources; it also means making sure that individuals are not overburdened while others stand aside and bid them manage as best they can."
"We want to ensure together that Europe changes for the better."
"Mr President, Rainer Böge’s report before us concerns the future financing of the EU."
"I wish to say a special thank you to him for his exceptional expertise and hard work."
"At the same time I wish to thank all the committee members for their constructive cooperation."
"The financial frameworks create a basis for the EU’s future policy areas."
"Particular areas of focus this time are regional, structural and cohesion policy and improved levels of employment and competitiveness."
"The intention is to increase structural policy financing and rural development funds, to guarantee that there is balanced development."
"The needs of the new Member States are understood and accepted, but the report quite rightly points out that the more susceptible regions of the old Member States should not be made to pay for the new cohesion policy."
"To improve employment levels and boost economic growth, the purpose within the financial frameworks is to invest particularly in research and development, and education and training."
"This money would be increased to three times the sum in seven years."
"The priority is absolutely the right one."
"Economising on these is economising on our own future, and this I wish to warn others against, especially the country holding the presidency."
"The aim is to use additional funds to strengthen the European dimension in research and development."
"I would like to make a strong appeal to the Member States to lose no time in adopting the new financial perspective and the interinstitutional Agreement as proposed by Parliament."
"Mr President, I want to concentrate on regional policy, which is a particular concern of mine. I would like to reiterate that one of the great advances achieved by this report consists in the 0.41% allocation to something that is visible in even the smallest European village and makes Europe visible to those who live there."
"The European Union’s instrument of solidarity is economic and social cohesion."
"As we know, the Council is at present proposing a mere 0.37% as a basis for negotiation."
"I, for one, am prepared to go along with a 4% per Member State limit and with the retention – contrary to what was contained in the original draft – of the N+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund."
"I wish again to stress that I do not endorse our group’s proposal, as I do not believe that we need to impose an five-year limit, which is, in terms of regional policy, unacceptable under the present difficult conditions."
"The European Union does not have at its disposal the ideal mechanisms for either generating or allocating resources."
"Nor has it adopted a 10- to 20-year perspective on specific economic and other policies."
"One has only to remember the long-term lack of effective supervision of agriculture."
"Despite the huge efforts it made, which I appreciate, the temporary committee could not, at this stage, have achieved any more than it did, Mr Böge, and there is a chance that Parliament will vote in favour of this compromise."
"Whereas Parliament considers that resources should be set at 1.08% of gross national product, the Council considers, in contrast, that the figure should be between 1.03% and 1.05% of gross domestic product."
"This shows that the future will be less about indices than about the correct mechanisms for distributing resources, and many pitfalls still lie in wait on the path to final agreement in the area of the financial perspective."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I will put aside the thoughts I had gathered for today in order to consider a number of interventions and again explore what they are about."
"The Commission has come up with a proposal, and Parliament – by means of the Böge report and of tomorrow’s decision – has shown itself capable of acting and negotiating."
"At present, the Council – lacking any agreement whatever on a basis for negotiation – is capable of doing neither of those things."
"Our proposal is a compromise."
"I call upon the Heads of State or Government, along with their ministers of finance, to read it through for themselves and to see whether it might make it possible to broker an agreement in the Council without our weakening the European Union."
"I am addressing the Members of the Council when I say that the proposal they have already put on the table amounts to 40% less for the EU’s competitiveness, 10% less for cohesion and growth and employment, 6% less for rural development and agriculture, 50% less for internal policies and 40% less for the European Union’s role as a global partner."
"You may thereby get agreement in the Council, but you will not get any agreement from us, not least for the second reason, which is that you are making cuts across the board."
"If we stick to the status quo, without setting any new priorities, we will need EUR 890 billion."
"Your proposal envisages EUR 871 billion."
"If we do not come to an agreement, we will have EUR 931 billion."
"Your Budget is tighter than the one we have already and more limited than a lack of agreement would make it, and that is why you have to understand that our offer is made with negotiations in mind."
"If the figure goes below EUR 931 billion, there will not be any!"
"Mr President, I would like to acknowledge Mr Böge’s determination to carry out this exercise in financial engineering and balancing on the first occasion in the history of the financial perspectives that the European Parliament has voluntarily set its direct ambitions even lower than the Commission’s proposal, which was already minimal."
"Only the opportunity to facilitate a quick, balanced and fair agreement, which clears up any doubts and anxieties at this time, could justify this."
"That is how we wish to interpret the Commission's conciliatory words and we would urge the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to do so."
"Nevertheless, I am not pleased that Parliament should be demonstrating a minimalist tendency which began with the last Agenda 2000 and which has not helped to increase confidence amongst the European citizens."
"I am referring to the risk of the budget returning to a renationalising tendency and of basing the Union’s objectives upon insufficient resources."
"We regret the pressure represented by the initial proposal of six Member States, some of which were perfectly understandable given the current situation, but others are guilty of not sufficiently explaining the added value of each euro spent and the high economic and commercial return resulting from the Union's development."
"We regret that the 1% has replaced the ideas by percentage, but, on the other hand, it has also relaunched the debate on the urgency of fundamentally reviewing the system of own resources."
"What we do not agree with is the fact that the rapporteur applies it exclusively to the funding of the CAP, which is still trying to digest the last Brussels reform; let us not throw our farmers out with the bathwater."
"We welcome the effort to maintain the share for the cohesion policy, and also the strengthening of the Union's social policies, growth and employment policies and also justice and foreign policies."
"We would call on the rapporteur to extend the logical phasing out mechanism, which already acknowledges the regions affected by the amplifying effect of enlargement, and to apply it to the Cohesion Fund."
"The European Parliament defended it in Agenda 2000 and we do not understand why, when the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is applying it, Parliament is not now doing so."
"We also call on the rapporteur to accept Amendment 1, which combats the discrimination that would result from applying the competition and excellence policy in an exclusive manner."
"The report presented to the Parliament by Mr Böge is an excellent example of the common work of an enlarged [European Union] of 25 Member States."
"I do regret that we take no pleasure in that."
"Finding a decision concerning the Community funds that would be acceptable and apprehensible for all was a very complicated task; however, this successful decision proves that the enlarged European Union is viable and has a long-term vision of economic development."
"Naturally, we could have come to that decision sooner and better had there been no attempts to oppose national and co-European interests, had there been no deviations in the technical particulars."
"At times I got the impression that we had convened as a group of accountants instead of society’s leaders."
"We have to understand that we need to develop a common European vision prior to commencing any financial planning, and this common European vision is being missed by both the citizens and the representatives of the society."
"Therefore, any discussions about financial plans, annual plans that will specify this perspective, should commence with a discussion about that economic vision, which we all have to develop; only thereafter should we define the spheres, the type of financing and the means required."
"That is what I miss in the work of the European Commission, and I do regret that today’s speech by the Commission President has been a complaint of a very tired person to Parliament about the problems of negotiations."
"Mr President, I fear that this very important debate on the Financial Perspective will breed frustration, because the Council is proposing something of a shoestring budget which does not match Europe’s ambitions."
"Nevertheless, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Böge, whose task was a difficult one and who managed to accommodate Members’ demands."
"To come to the Financial Perspective, it continues to give a great deal of cause for concern and is unacceptable in some points."
"Following the events of these past few weeks, there is a need to be able to respond to public expectations and not to let a chasm open up between political promises and the action that would serve to achieve the objectives of competitiveness, full employment, research and training and, above all, solidarity."
"Yes, we are in favour of cohesion policy, provided it does not rule out support to the regions of the old 15-member Union that remain disadvantaged."
"Allow me to explain my concern with regard to the Council."
"The Member States must not be timid about Europe."
"What can I say about the proposals regarding the common agricultural policy, the CAP, which is poised to become a national agricultural policy or NAP, an appropriate name, with the Council closing its eyes to the needs of farmers as renationalisation looms and a political symbol of Europe is set to disappear?"
"The same concern surrounds regional policy, which our regions need so much, and our major trans-European projects."
"We shall also be very vigilant with regard to the funding of Natura 2000."
"If we are to finance our priorities, there will surely be a need to review the rules governing the calculation of the Union’s resources and to renegotiate the benefits granted during the last century, particularly the British rebate."
"Mr Barroso has told us that he can count on the European Parliament."
"Together, we shall perhaps succeed in persuading the Council that it really must make an effort to ensure that the EU budget is not the shoestring budget I dread."
"As a member delegated by one of the new Member States onto the temporary committee dealing with the financial perspectives of the enlarged European Union, I would first of all like to emphasise how much it means to us that the European Parliament’s position on this issue, so vital in terms of the new Member States’ process of catching up with the European Union, is no longer being formulated without our involvement, but with our concrete and substantive collaboration."
"This was the first time we have been able to participate in the committee debate, which proved to be remarkably informative, thought-provoking and, although not entirely free from tensions, certainly pointed the way forward and I congratulate Mr Reimer Böge on his chairmanship of this debate and on the balanced outcome that was achieved."
"We are also aware that our participation not only creates opportunities, but brings with it responsibility too."
"Because of this sense of responsibility, we tried to avoid pushing too hard on issues that cannot realistically be dealt with, given the current situation of the Union, although they are important in terms of our catching up and thus for the progress of the European Union as a whole."
"Instead, we concentrated on those details, and in some cases matters of a technical nature, that are vitally important for our catching up process in practical terms, but also in terms of their theoretical and political significance."
"Thus, we think the most important thing at present is to ensure that the structural funds and cohesion funds aimed at promoting catching up are made available to us at an appropriate level, without any tightening of the technical regulations that might cause transitional difficulties for new Member States."
"We welcome the Böge report’s affirmation that 0.41% of the Union’s GNI should be allocated for this purpose, with new Member States being able to use this up to a level representing 4% of their gross national income and that the N+2 rule should not be applied to the cohesion funds."
"In our judgment, this means that even though the new EU budget is of necessity tighter, it will still provide appropriate assistance to foster the catch-up of the new Member States."
"This, in addition to demonstrating solidarity, will also help to enhance Europe’s competitiveness, boost growth and create jobs."
"Mr President, my government says that the British budget rebate is defensible, and it is!"
"On the same basis, net contributors like Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, should also have a rebate."
"But over the next few years the British rebate will increase markedly in size and the poorest Member States will have to contribute towards it."
"That is not defensible."
"My government says that the rebate is non-negotiable."
"This is nonsense."
"The European Union is a giant machine for negotiating agreements between 25 countries and everything relevant should be considered negotiable if positive benefits can be secured in return."
"The rebate was introduced because of imbalances in the workings of the common agricultural policy."
"The price that Britain should demand for negotiating the rebate is the reopening of the agreement on agricultural spending, an agreement to which it acquiesced."
"We should support rural development; we should compensate farmers to ensure that environmental concerns are addressed."
"However, we should no more subsidise the very existence of farms than we should subsidise factories, quarries or coal mines."
"The CAP discriminates against farmers in developing nations and penalises our own consumers."
"A phased but significant programme of cuts in Pillar 1 expenditure should be introduced."
"That is the price Britain should demand."
"But to continue arguing that the rebate is simply non-negotiable is neither good for Europe nor best for Britain."
"– Mr President, although I congratulate Mr Böge on the work he has done, I should like to add my voice to the voices of all my fellow Members who expressed the wish for decisions on the financial perspectives to be taken now because, apart from anything else, the impression should not be given that the institutional crisis in the European Union is deepening."
"However, they must not, of course, be taken at the cost of the prospects of the European Union itself."
"The decisions need to be taken at a satisfactory level for all the Member States."
"In saying this, I cannot but add that I am sorry that the proposals by the Luxembourg Presidency operate, unfortunately, to a very large degree to the detriment of cohesion policies with the proposed reduction from 0.41% of Community GDP to 0.37%."
"In all events, I should like to say that it is important that the Presidency at least try to limit the adverse repercussions of its proposals."
"How?"
"Firstly, with compensation mechanisms for the countries and regions which are disproportionately affected by the mechanism for distributing appropriations proposed by the Commission."
"Secondly, by reallocating the appropriations lost due to the Ν+2 rule."
"Similarly, I should like to say that we are, of course, opposed to the renationalisation and cofinancing of the common agricultural policy and, finally, to add, as there is talk on many sides of the savings which need to be made and of the fact that we cannot hand out additional appropriations, that the European Union budget corresponds in total to 2.5% of public spending in all the Member States."
"At some point, words and deeds with respect to the European Union will need to coincide."
"Mr President, the Union should now demonstrate its ability to act by adopting an ambitious Financial Perspective."
"The fact is that the Presidency’s proposals, although they do break the 1% barrier, remain timid."
"That the Union should only be allowed to spend another EUR 40 billion in absolute terms over a seven-year period is disappointing."
"Let us imagine for a moment that all of this money were to be invested in research."
"At the present time, the Americans spend one hundred billion euros more than Europeans on research every year. An amount of 40 billion, spread over seven years, would not even correspond to half of the present annual shortfall, although much of this gap will obviously have to be filled by the private sector."
"Europe has run aground."
"The political gnomes who govern us are allowing demagogues from the extreme Right and Left, including National Socialists and other separatists, to demolish the European dream."
"Our Union needs more solidarity and therefore more of its own resources in order to overthrow the niggardly accounting system based on net balances and rebates."
"I have proposed a European levy of one cent on every litre of petrol, diesel and kerosene sold in the Union."
"No consumer or economic operator would buckle under the weight of such a tax, which would net more than EUR 40 billion over seven years."
"Let us dare to break the mould of national self-interest; let us dare to adopt a more European approach."
"It is impossible to identify precisely where benefits accrue and costs are incurred within a single market."
"The countries with the most developed economies evidently benefit most from any additional common growth."
"The Böge report is good not only because it is a splendid piece of work, but also because it lends itself to being used as a pillar for negotiations, while at the same time being a practicable compromise in itself."
"It enables the plans of the Union to be put into effect, but without placing an intolerable burden on the contributors."
"It boldly proposes new solutions for new situations."
"One such solution, that is often mentioned, is national top-ups, which, incidentally, has already been tried out on us, the new Member States."
"It is in the interests of Hungary and of all the cohesion countries, that 0.41% of EU income is channelled into supporting convergence."
"With this, we will be able to develop research and a knowledge-based society and promote road-network construction and job creation."
"All of this will help to breathe life into the Lisbon dream."
"But will anything actually come of it at all?"
"The question for the moment is not so much how to reach agreement on concrete figures with the Council, but whether there will be a Council position at all, in other words, whether the European Council will reach agreement with itself?"
"If the Heads of Government spend their time next week merely bemoaning the outcome of the referenda on the Constitution and fail to decide on the basic principles of the financial framework aimed at serving the interests of the citizens of Europe, then, to the delight of the eurosceptics, the Union really will face a crisis."
"Reaching a common position geared towards the interests of the new Europe of 450 million citizens will be a good thing for every Member State."
"Aloofness and selfishness never lead anywhere."
"The solution is not to turn away from the Union, but to embrace Europe even more."
"Following the failure of the referenda, can we allow matters to be made worse by the failure of the financial plans for the period after 2007?"
"Fellow Members of this House, let us support the Böge report, let there be at least one piece of solid ground in this situation in which collapse seems imminent and let the citizens of Europe see which institution represents their real interests."
"Mr President, members of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the referendum has had such a powerful impact on the political debate and on people’s psychology that some commentators have been forced to even wonder whether there is still a need for the European institutions now that the remarkable peace mission carried out by Europe is complete."
"We are well aware that Europe is not only useful, but also necessary."
"In order for Europe to be useful, unified and competitive, however, and therefore perceived as necessary by the people, it must be able to develop its policies and be endowed with the resources to do so."
"Within this syllogism, which may seem obvious, lies the full significance of the battle that Parliament is waging on the financial perspectives."
"Therein lies the significance of everything that this House’s rapporteur, Reiner Böge, has been able to instil in a text that I consider satisfactory and pragmatic, without being defeatist."
"Without doubt, the question that we are all asking is: ‘Will we succeed in reaching an agreement with the Council?’"
"A lot depends on the scale of our vote, ladies and gentlemen, and even more on the ability of Heads of Government to resist becoming overwhelmed by the logic of money and their devotion to their own national interests."
"This afternoon Mr Barroso delivered a clear and determined address, which we welcome."
"Mr Juncker should apply his remarkable negotiating skills to the pursuit of a dignified agreement and avoid being dragged into a never-ending bilateral mediation which, , risks unjustly and unjustifiably penalising certain parties."
"My fellow Members, I call on us to defend, with a broad-based and united vote, the right and duty of the Union to exist and to carry out its work."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to point out that one of the fundamental merits of the work of the rapporteur, Mr Böge, is that of regarding the process of European integration as an ongoing political dynamic, with high-profile objectives and ambitions."
"Confidence, prospects and momentum: these are what the public needs today in order to avoid falling victim to scepticism and resignation."
"I would above all, therefore, like to give credit to Mr Böge for having, with great wisdom and balance, produced a sensitive report that required complex analysis and has resulted in effective political proposals."
"It is an even more worthy outcome considering the difficult climate, due particularly to narrow-minded, intransigent pressure groups, in which his work began and has continued up to now."
"The resolution points out the priorities for the revival of Europe: the untouchable status of the cohesion policy, the importance of promoting the competitiveness and development of the Union, the need for an increasingly effective common policy in the area of justice and home affairs, the need to give impetus to external relations and to the dynamics of integration of the single market, in addition to enhancing the concept of flexibility in order to make the European financial framework agile and effective."
"We cannot hide the fact, however, that from the way in which it is outlined in Mr Böge’s report, the European Parliament’s position differs significantly from the working document presented by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 June."
"We fear that the European Council may approve a compromise with extremely disappointing political and financial content."
"In the knowledge that we will be faced with a compromise, which will be the outcome of painful mediation, we will never let our readiness to find balanced solutions dwindle."
"We will do everything possible to avert the possibility of an institutional battle."
"It must be clear, however, that the Council will not be able to call on our sense of responsibility, in order to involve the European Parliament in an exercise that has the effect of killing off the integration process."
"Mr President, the EU has just celebrated the 60th anniversary of a shared peace at a time when two of the founding countries have just expressed their doubts at the ballot box."
"Faced with the social effects of globalisation, the moral crisis linked to unemployment and inequality is adding to the democratic crisis, not to mention the budgetary crisis."
"The final decision on the financial perspectives will be crucial to the credibility and legitimacy of the EU and of its institutions."
"Two political events are much anticipated."
"The first is the success of enlargement."
"It is our duty to reach this stage, in the interests of equality between our countries and our citizens."
"The contribution recommended by our rapporteur for territorial and social cohesion is necessary, though not adequate: specifically, it lacks increased funding for transport networks."
"I also support the creation of the growth adjustment fund to help us achieve this objective."
"The second event is the future: our old industrial continent is in the process of changing and we must level out the territorial, economic and cultural inequalities."
"It will only be possible to create new products and new services to combine productivity and solidarity if research and innovation are adequately funded."
"The doubling of the research budget and the objective of 3% of the EU’s GNI by 2010 absolutely must be respected."
"On these two political conditions, and on the assumption that our ambitions will be funded by their own new resources, I am supporting the reasonable choice of our rapporteur, so that our Parliament can exercise its full authority in the coming negotiations and bring the Council round to its way of thinking."
"– Mr President, the EU’s identity is built on a sense of belonging that comes from a common desire to share."
"Cohesion policy has been a very positive instrument and has had considerable success in fostering this sense of belonging."
"Consequently, the weakening of cohesion policy has led to financial difficulties or to some projects being postponed."
"Worse still, by moving in this direction, the Union’s sense of belonging will fade and weaken, and may suffer irreversible damage."
"Reducing the financial resources of cohesion policy is tantamount to dealing a hammer blow to the European spirit."
"The winner is selfish interest and the loser is solidarity, and without the latter there cannot be a sense of belonging and a notion of a European entity."
"On the subject of the cohesion policy, it would appear to make perfect sense to discuss an aspect that, being fresh in our minds, should help to formulate a cohesion policy that matches our new reality."
"This new element concerns the need to assess the impact, in the different areas of European territory, of the phenomenon of the invasion of Asian products."
"In discussions on the Financial Perspective in recent months, attempts have been made to discover who is and who is not a net contributor, by examining the budget with a fine-tooth comb."
"This kind of negotiation is unpleasant for all involved."
"I believe that the main reason why this happens is that the EU’s current funding model has been exhausted."
"I therefore address my last words to the Council."
"I feel it is clear that the reform of EU financing cannot be put off, and failure to heed such advice is evidence of political blinkeredness."
"I shall finish by congratulating Mr Böge on the excellent report that he has submitted to this House."
"– Mr President, it is a matter of political credibility for the European Union, following enlargement, to safeguard the financial resources for the implementation of development, employment, regional convergence and social cohesion policies."
"This need appears to be all the more urgent following the recent results for the European Constitution in France and the Netherlands."
"I truly wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his work, but I believe that it is disappointing for 1.07% in payment appropriations, compared with the 1.14% initially proposed by the European Commission, to be proposed as the position of the European Parliament."
"This limited financial framework lays down from the outset a European political programme of low expectations, which certainly does not respond to the new and major requirements of our times and of the peoples of Europe."
"As for the specific issues, I do not believe that the philosophy of cofinancing the common agricultural policy is acceptable."
"Any such development would lead to farmers running at different speeds, to greater inequalities between the regions, and would have serious consequences on the financial aspect of the cohesion countries."
"Similarly, I agree with everyone who said that the adequacy of resources for the Structural Funds and for the Cohesion Fund needs to be safeguarded."
"Certainly the new countries need to be supported but, at the same time, the regions in the old cohesion countries, which are suffering the consequences of enlargement due to the statistical effect, must be given fundamental support."
"If European integration is to reacquire momentum and win the trust of the citizens, it cannot be encaged in administrative and accounting perceptions."
"Unfortunately, the proposal by the Luxembourg Presidency moves in this restricted direction at a huge cost for the cohesion policies."
"In the European Council next week, the Heads of State or Government will have to rise to the occasion and take bold decisions about European priority policies and the need to finance them."
"Mr President, I think that, at a time when, following the referenda, Europe is indeed in crisis, it is essential that the institutions should prove that the European Union continues, and indeed, can continue, to function."
"This is where a decision about the multi-annual plan will be an important credibility test, and hence the great significance of us in this House being able to take a stand tomorrow, which we are in a position to do probably thanks to the remarkable work of our rapporteur, in respect of which we have given the necessary means to be able to realise the enlargement but also – and we owe this again to the rapporteur’s proposals – make the new policy in the Union possible."
"We hope that, under Luxembourg leadership and with the help of the Commission, the Council will then work out a proposal which forms a real basis of negotiation with Parliament in order to reach agreement."
"I would like to emphasise today that it is already apparent that, with a view to the future, it will be impossible to work with the EU’s means as they are defined today."
"If we are to get the European Union to function properly, 1% is too little and so, in all likelihood, is 1.7%."
"The British rebate mortgages all of our own resources, but the fundamental decision must be that if the European Union cannot have its genuine own resources at its disposal, the EU will, sooner or later, run aground."
"The Union must be able to define its own policy with its genuine own means. Only then will we be able to realise our ambitions."
"Discussions on this at the next multi-annual plan must also form part of the agreement we will be concluding with the Council."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning the European Parliament will vote on its position regarding the forthcoming Financial Perspective for 2007–2013."
"This will be one of the most important and significant votes in this session of Parliament."
"The European Parliament has basically supported the European Commission’s proposal, but has changed the structure of the Financial Perspective a little."
"The European Development Fund has been removed from the framework of the Financial Perspective and a reserve of 24 billion euros has been created."
"As a result, the amount of expenditure proposed by the European Parliament is apparently smaller – 1.07% of European Union gross national income – but, if the European Development Fund and the reserve are included, we would be close to the European Commission’s proposal."
"In the European Parliament’s proposal the main decrease in expenditure relates to sub-programme 1.a, ‘Competitiveness for growth and employment’, and also to administrative expenditure by the EU institutions, channelling extra resources towards the European Parliament’s traditional priorities."
"The European Parliament has acknowledged that the amount of expenditure allocated in the Commission’s proposal to sub-programme 1.b, ‘Cohesion for growth and employment’, is justified."
"The total amount of resources channelled into the EU funds is 0.41% of European Union GNI."
"Not only is the amount of resources channelled into the EU funds important, but also the principles for the distribution of these resources."
"Various important questions are dealt with in the European Parliament’s position."
"The first relates to the Commission’s proposal to set a ceiling of 4% of a Member State’s GNI on the amount of resources which may be received from European Union funds."
"The European Parliament considers that the setting of a 4% ceiling is based on the experience of the past and that a flexible approach to the setting of ceilings is now needed."
"It should be remembered that a set of small and economically relatively less developed states have joined the EU."
"Secondly, the European Parliament considers that there should be a differentiation in the level of cofinancing from EU funds, depending on a Member State’s level of economic development."
"This means that a higher percentage of cofinancing from EU funds could be allocated to less developed EU Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second-largest entry in the Financial Perspective is for expenditure on economic and social cohesion."
"Being concerned with regional policy, I am at one with the rapporteur – whom I congratulate on this excellent report – in believing that the EU’s ability to cope with the past and forthcoming enlargements and to reduce regional disparities is absolutely dependent on a strong and well-funded European regional policy being in place."
"On the other hand, though, EU structural policy must be equipped with sufficient resources to make it possible, in future, for adequate support to be offered to less developed regions and to those with particular socio-economic problems, including those in the old EU Member States."
"While it is of course the Commission proposal that best complies with the guidelines for the EU’s regional policy in the forthcoming planning period, which aim at the reduction of disparities between one region and another, we regard Mr Böge’s proposal as an acceptable compromise in comparison with both it and the quite unacceptable demand made by the six net contributors."
"Under no circumstances must cuts in the Budget fall hardest upon regional policy."
"The allocation proposed in the Commission’s draft regulations for cohesion funds for the individual targets is acceptable only if there is an increase of 1.14% in total resources."
"If cuts are made along the lines envisaged by the Böge report or, indeed, the Council regulation, resources must be more concentrated on resolving the grave problems in the regions most deserving of support."
"There must be no across-the-board cuts, that is to say cuts made without affecting the relative allocations, for these would unilaterally impose burdens on the convergence regions in the EU’s old Member States."
"Mr President, I would like, as others have done, to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Böge on his work."
"He has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances."
"I would also like to align myself with Mr Wynn’s rather than Mr Davies’ remarks about the British rebate, hardly surprisingly."
"As one speaker has said, we are all equal but some are more equal than others."
"But the idea in paragraph 51, indent 5 might give a sensible idea of how to proceed, bringing in national parliaments to make our own resources system more transparent."
"I wish to raise one specific point which is of great importance."
"The European Union is going through turbulent times."
"We have no idea what our policies are going to be by 2013."
"We have no idea now what our external policies will be, particularly in relation to enlargement."
"We need a pause for reflection on the length of our commitment to this financial perspective."
"It is best to go for a five-year period, which is the same as the mandates of the Commission and of the European Parliament, because looking too far in the future would be an abuse of the democratic process."
"Of course, legislative proposals can be for a longer period, but five years would allow us to sort out our policies on expenditure and own resources."
"Of course we need to go for an agreement."
"I agree with Mr Dehaene that we should give the presidencies as much as encouragement as possible to find one."
"But this Parliament should not sign up to any agreement at all."
"As we heard very clearly from our rapporteur, we need one that will be in our interests and the interests of our electorate and that is what we hope will come out of the Council in a few days’ time."
"I thank the rapporteur for his enormous hard work and, in particular, for supporting my amendment on the democracy programme, which now forms the last paragraph of the report."
"I commend it to the Council and the Commission."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Böge, because he has been able to send a crystal clear message to the Commission and the Council indicating what this Parliament wants."
"How much money are we prepared to spend on the European project?"
"What financial effort are we prepared to dedicate to the process of European integration at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, when it is at a crossroads?"
"The rapporteur proposes less than the Commission, but more than the Council has proposed this afternoon."
"The President-in-Office of the Council says that we must create balances."
"I would stress what Mr Elles has said: balances are required, but we should remind the Council that with less money we will not create more Europe, we will create less Europe at a time when we need to re-affirm this project."
"The referenda that have been held in recent days, as many speakers have mentioned, have reminded us of the need to focus on the real needs of our citizens, and they want us to grow more quickly."
"In order to do that, we must create more jobs, we must be more productive, we must spend more money on investment, research and development. In short, we must implement the Lisbon reforms."
"And in order to do that, we need money."
"Our citizens have also reminded us that they believe in a social model in which both cohesion and the efficiency of the market are priorities."
"Without a policy of correcting territorial imbalances, the economic project represented by the European Union could probably survive."
"What would not survive would be the political project that is at stake here."
"We must convince our citizens that together we can deal with our future challenges: the challenges of globalisation, of competition from emerging countries, of relocation of companies and the ageing of the population."
"And in order to do that we need more money."
"As an additional and final point, I would like to express my strong opposition to the beginning of co-funding of the agricultural policy, since that will also mean breaking the social cohesion rules on which the model we believe in has been based."
"Madam President, what we are concerned with here is prioritising EU expenditure."
"It is necessary to be able not only to prioritise what is important but also to give lower priority to what is less important."
"In setting priorities, we must also be able to distinguish between the common, and most important, tasks of the EU and the important tasks of the Member States."
"We have not reached the point of doing that in this work on the financial perspectives."
"If the Commission’s proposal had been implemented, it would have meant an increase of almost a third in the Swedish membership contribution."
"It would have reduced the scope for the investments in growth and new jobs that must be made in Sweden, and it would have created major budget problems."
"If we want Europe to become the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy, it does not make sense for us to give priority to the rich Member States’ contributions at the expense of developing a common infrastructure in our weakest regions."
"Not enough priority has yet been given to this area."
"Nor is it sensible of us to give priority to marketing efforts in the developing countries on behalf of European agriculture, at the same time as reducing our most important investments in Europe’s knowledge and research community."
"If, in your negotiations, you – the Council and the Commission – do not manage to ensure that we are able to achieve the objective of devoting 3% of the European economy to aiding knowledge and research so that European research can take the lead in Europe’s knowledge-based society, then you will fail in setting one of the most important priorities needed by Europe."
"The rapporteur has done a fantastic job, involving clear priorities."
"The Commission did not, and the Council now appears to be reducing the investment that should be made in research."
"I urge it not to do this."
"Europe needs aid for research."
"Madam President, this is an important debate with major consequences for the future of the Union, and I also want to pay tribute to the rapporteur for the impressive way in which he has carried out what is undoubtedly a very onerous task in producing his report."
"There are, however, one or two areas where I have difficulty with his conclusions."
"First of all, I think it obviously is crucial that EU spending be kept under tight control and that expenditure should be used as efficiently as possible."
"No national government, I would suggest, could contemplate some of the spending increases that have been suggested for the 2007-2013 period."
"Taxpayers across the EU have a right to expect politicians to spend wisely and given the recent referendum results, it is clear that many in Europe and not just in Britain share concerns that vast quantities of their money are being spent on major projects of which they do not seem to know enough."
"In terms of the overall budget, I can support the current position of the British Government, as well as a number of other governments, and believe that it should be capped at 1% of the total national income of the Union."
"On the question of the United Kingdom rebate, I believe that it is justified and certainly I am going to look carefully at the position taken up by our Prime Minister, Mr Blair, at the European Council next week."
"My one plea, without going back over old ground, is that I hope that the issue of the United Kingdom rebate does not find itself becoming part of a separate set of negotiations about the future of Europe following the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands this week."
"It is a serious matter and it needs to be dealt with in a serious way and I am sure there are views on both sides on this, but to tie it into a general set of negotiations and discussions, when critical issues have to be decided for the future of our continent, would seem to me totally inappropriate."
". Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you have had a rich, constructive, but at times contradictory debate on an excellent report that will certainly help us to reach a compromise."
"However, as your debate – which was certainly not lacking in contradictions – has shown, the Presidency has to manage these contradictions, which sometimes become even greater when they are presented by the Heads of Government or by the ministers of the various governments."
"From the starting point of these contradictions, we must try to reach a balance between all these elements so that we can finally resolve the matter and reach a compromise."
"You will therefore understand that this task is not a particularly easy one."
"Similarly, your rapporteur’s task was not an easy one at all."
"I note that, on certain points, it has been said that action must be taken on the UK’s rebate."
"The Presidency completely agrees with this; it has put forward proposals in this vein."
"Others say the opposite, and bring agricultural issues into the equation."
"Does this mean that we must reduce the EU’s agricultural policy, with all the consequences that would entail?"
"Do we want the countryside of Europe to become a desert?"
"That is a specific and precise question that needs to be answered."
"I think that, in any case, Europe needs to have priorities and must have a clearer idea of where it wants to go."
"The Presidency, or rather Luxembourg, could have signed the Commission’s proposals very happily."
"It has problems, however, with the wording of these proposals."
"Having said that, I certainly do not dispute that they form a very solid base from which to prepare for the future of Europe."
"Unfortunately, on the basis of these proposals alone, we will not reach a compromise next week."
"We therefore need to look again for this compromise, to see how and to what extent we can reduce the figures proposed without, in future, depriving the Community budget of its impact, its influence and its ability to guide policy."
"Certain speakers say that we have cut 40% here, 30% there."
"Nevertheless, I myself have noted that there is real growth under all the headings."
"In some cases, this growth may be inadequate, but in others it is quite significant and takes account of the priorities that you as MEPs regard as particularly important."
"I wonder where we would end up if there were no agreement, if we stuck with a sort of status quo?"
"According to my information, we would probably end up with a budget or financial perspectives of about EUR 835 billion from 2006."
"The Presidency proposes more."
"It is more ambitious; it may not be ambitious enough, but it is more so than the Member States, or at least than a number of Member States are prepared to be."
"I agree with the idea that Europe needs to find new momentum."
"We need to fight, first of all, against demagoguery, against those who claim that too much European money is being squandered."
"I think that we must not under any circumstances tolerate these claims, which damage not only the effectiveness of Europe, but also, ultimately, our entire project."
"I think that those debates must not take place; they must be thwarted."
"Europe needs solidarity."
"I completely agree with the idea that it needs greater solidarity."
"The Europe of 25, the Europe of 27, but also the Europe of 15."
"But we must strike the right balance in this approach based on solidarity, and that is what we have tried to do; we need to distinguish between rich regions, poor regions in rich countries, and poor regions in poor countries, because they are not quite the same thing."
"That is why I think it is important to find the right balance that will enable everyone to find his or her way."
"Europe must also spend its money more effectively."
"That is a message that we must convey."
"Perhaps we should define better the added value of European policies, work more to improve the quality of Community expenditure, concentrate our expenditure more, improve coordination between Community expenditure, European expenditure and national expenditure."
"All of this will certainly enable Lisbon to progress further."
"I would, in all sincerity, ask the following question: with regard, for example, to life-long learning, do we really need to pass funds via Brussels to support projects in our Member States?"
"Would it not perhaps be preferable to create a framework, to set out rules and to improve cooperation in defining policies?"
"It is sometimes necessary to be selective, in order to focus our resources where they can really produce the best results."
"We all agree with the idea that we need to increase investment in research."
"We also know that the Community budget cannot, on its own, achieve the objectives we have set ourselves."
"We need better coordination between Community expenditure, national expenditure and contributions, private funding."
"I think that this may be a field in which the US could provide an example, if we observe how they succeed in managing their spending better, not only quantitatively, but maybe qualitatively too."
"I cannot promise you that the Presidency will reach a compromise."
"I cannot guarantee that this compromise will be as ambitious as you would like."
"But I can say one thing: if we do not reach a compromise, the situation could not be worse."
"It will be worse in the sense that we will not be able to define programmes."
"Thus, the whole of Europe, everyone who is waiting for something from Europe, everyone who is waiting for money to finance programmes that aim to improve competitivity and cohesion, will all be left hanging, and that is not something that will improve the image of Europe just at a time when it needs to be improved and to be strengthened in the eyes of our citizens."
". Madam President, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your remarks and comments this afternoon."
"I am struck by how similar your priorities are to those of the Commission, in particular boosting economic growth, job creation, solidarity with the poorest people, those who most need true solidarity in our approach, and also meeting commitments we have made, in other words bringing our commitments, and our finances, into line with our political priorities."
"In this debate, you have demonstrated the usefulness of the European budget; you have shown that, very often, spending at European level enables savings at national level and that there is an added value to such spending."
"Spending at European level very often makes it possible to realise projects that would not otherwise have been achieved."
"On these two points, the priorities and the usefulness of the budgetary instrument for our Europe, for Europe’s ambitions and for solidarity within Europe, there is therefore considerable convergence between the points of view of the Commission and of the European Parliament."
"We have now reached – as we are all aware – a crucial moment, and I think that we could summarise the spirit of today’s debate by saying that we – or in any case most of us, I think – really do want an agreement, and we want a good agreement."
"We want an ambitious agreement, an ambition for Europe, a Europe that is not a Europe of rebates, and, at the same time, we want a Europe that shows solidarity."
"That is the conclusion that I, at least, take from this debate."
"To reach such an agreement, however, we must be prepared to make compromises and, on this subject, I would like to address the Presidency."
"I am well aware that the Presidency is making extraordinary efforts."
"I am constantly aware of it."
"I am in constant contact with the President of the Council, Mr Juncker, and I think that we need to express our gratitude to him, to the Luxembourg Government and to Luxembourg’s diplomats."
"It is true that the Presidency mainly works with the Member States, but I remember what Mr Schmit has just said."
"He said that he, personally, could certainly subscribe to the Commission’s initial proposal."
"I think the same thing with regard to the Böge report, which, I hope, will be voted for tomorrow."
"Pass your resolution!"
"I would now call on the Presidency to introduce into this crucial phase of negotiations the message that Parliament will send tomorrow."
"It is true that contradictions and different points of view have been expressed in this House, but I think that our vote tomorrow will nevertheless express Parliament’s will."
"As we all agreed during these negotiations, they are not limited to just the Member States – even though their role is decisive, the negotiations are taking place between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"As a result, what we now ask the Presidency – whilst congratulating it on its determination and whilst telling it that we want a compromise and that we are here to help it reach that compromise – is to reach a compromise that is closer to what Parliament will, I hope, vote for tomorrow, and also closer to the Commission’s proposal than to that from certain Member States, even though we recognise that they do have real difficulties that we must not underestimate."
"That is my appeal."
"That is my appeal to the Presidency."
"It is also my appeal to all MEPs so that we can look forward to this final phase – I hope it is the final one – of negotiations in a spirit of compromise and so that the message that comes out of the next European Council is again a positive one."
"Once again, Europe will surprise its enemies by showing that, in difficult situations, and particularly in difficult situations, we are capable not only of finding a solution, but of finding a credible solution, in other words a solution that brings together our ambitions and the instruments that we give to the European institutions to achieve those ambitions."
". Madam President, I would like to close this debate with two short remarks."
"There is one point on which I am in complete agreement with the Council Presidency, and that is that no headway will be made, either in the Council or in Parliament, if there are those who see their role as being to speak up for special interests, while others see themselves as responsible for brokering compromises."
"It is for that reason that what this House needs to do tomorrow is to set out a quite definite negotiating position, and to do so by as large a majority as possible."
"One thing, though – and this I have to say to Mr Schmit – that one thing I too do not accept is the celebrated chaos theory, according to which all is lost if there is no mutual understanding."
"Following the vote in plenary tomorrow, we will need to employ the time left to us before the European Council meets in talks and negotiations. Whilst I recognise that the problem lies perhaps in the Council itself rather than in the Presidency, the Council must not get the idea that everything will be sorted out once it reaches a compromise."
"It is far more important that we should first define our negotiating position, that the Council should set out its position in relation to that, and that Parliament should eventually have to agree."
"What matters, then, is that we use the next 10 days in working very hard to hammer out a workable compromise."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0246/2005), and we will be taking a number of questions to the Commission."
"The debate on the use of official EU languages within the institutions has not yet produced a reply to the question of how to devise a new system for the use of official languages and how to define working languages and the way in which they should be used."
"This is needed in order to clarify the terms of the debate and to promote the linguistic, and thus cultural, heritage of the EU Member States."
"Will the Commission say how it plans to deal with the question of official languages within the institutions and whether it intends to designate working languages (Council Regulation No 1/58 refers only to official languages (Article 1)), so as to ensure that the choice of one language over another is not left largely to the discretion of senior officials (see the answer to Question H-0159/05(1)) and thereby prevent unfair discrimination?"
"What proposals will it put forward in order to promote Italy's linguistic heritage following publication of the Eurydice report 'Key Data on Teaching Languages at School in Europe', bearing in mind that it funds the Eurydice network and that proposals are needed in response to the very worrying statistics on Italian language teaching in Europe contained in the report?"
". In reply to the honourable Member, the Commission has already pointed out several times, and in particular in its reply to Oral Question H-0159/05 by the honourable Member, that, in accordance with Council Regulation No 1/58 (Article 1) –the first one in the history of EU secondary legislation – all official languages are at the same time working languages and can therefore be used on the same legal terms and on the same basis within the institutions."
"So it is not correct to say that the current working languages within the European institutions have been reduced to three, namely English, French and German."
"As for internal procedures within the Commission, the documents submitted to it are drafted in these three languages at least."
"It is a rule that has purely internal effects and aims to guarantee that the Commission itself is in a position to understand documents of general interest."
"The Commission has found no evidence of any discrimination against other working languages as a result of this rule, which was drawn up on the instructions of both the current and former presidents of the Commission."
"Moreover, it is normal that, for operational reasons, certain languages are used more than others by Commission staff in their daily business."
"No senior management official has the power or the right to require his staff to use one working language rather than another."
"But sometimes it is the linguistic preferences or knowledge of Commissioners themselves which may require the use of a particular language."
"It goes without saying that it is mandatory to maintain internal communication among the Commission departments and inside the other institutions."
"All these practices are followed with due respect for the equality of languages as official and working languages."
"The Commission reiterates that it has no intention whatsoever of introducing a specific system involving the privileged use of one or several languages in its services."
"On the other hand, if the work of its services goes beyond internal business and involves contacts with outsiders, the Commission is committed to making use of as many official languages as possible, taking into account the limitations on available translation resources under the guidelines set out in its Document 638/6."
"Secondly, the Commission actively promotes multilingualism within the European Union, as indicated in its communication 'Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity: an Action Plan 2004-2006'."
"Under the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, specific actions and other actions for student and teacher exchanges can be used for the promotion of Italian, as for all other Community languages."
"Thus, the Lingua Action under the Socrates Programme financed eight different projects to promote the Italian language between 2000 and 2004."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two pieces of information have followed one after the other in recent months."
"The first concerned dropping the Italian language from Commission press conferences, which was followed by the publication of the Eurydice report – funded by the European Community – in which it emerged that Italian is one of the least studied languages in the world."
"These two facts would suggest, to a certain extent, that there is an intention to relegate the Italian language in importance."
"I would like to discuss a number of points, Commissioner."
"The fact is, we believe that considering only three languages to be official EU languages is inadequate, partly because six languages are spoken by at least 9% of the European population."
"Commissioner, I call on you to examine the possibility of introducing at least six working languages, that is to say, the languages that are spoken by at least 9-10% of the European population, namely English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Polish."
". In procedural terms, we use only some languages in the college, but at the official and working levels, all languages are equal."
"One of the changes or important phenomena, which one can see in the press conferences on Wednesdays, is that there is the possibility of using all the official languages."
"With this attitude and with the promotion of language learning, with multilingualism as a policy, not just an administrative part of our daily work, we will achieve significant progress and improvement, within the limits of our possibilities."
"The situation for languages from the time of enlargement shows that the Union is functioning – it did not collapse."
"All languages can be used by communicators within the Union."
"Speaking as Commissioner for Education, I must say that all our mobility programmes, our activities in the field of education, culture and vocational training strongly promote a language component."
"I am sure that, with that awareness and positive philosophy or policy we are on the right track."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it strikes me that the problematic thing about the advertisements for jobs with the Commission is that they often specify a mother tongue."
"Surely, if we are to have equality of opportunity in Europe, the least we can do is to require a certain standard of competence in a language rather than use of it from the cradle."
"Consideration should be given to whether the present practice might be changed in future."
". I would like to support that idea."
"Next month we want to introduce the communication on the new language competence indicator, which is now an important part of the growing question of competence and recognition of qualifications."
"We have agreed with Member States to promote language learning as early as possible."
"In a broader context, the 1 + 2 formula is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for the younger generation and for all citizens, who need to learn not only their mother tongue, but also two other European languages, one of which should preferably be that of a neighbour."
"That is the policy and basic philosophy supported by the Commission and, if this policy is promoted properly in Member States, multilingualism and language competence will increase markedly in the future European Union."
"I fully share the interest and support of the distinguished Member of Parliament."
"To what extent would the Commission support the Republic of Cyprus' participation in the Partnership for Peace and its association with NATO with a view to furthering mutual interests within the framework of the common European foreign and defence policy?"
". The European Union does not have competence in the issue covered in question 32, because it is purely and simply a bilateral issue between a Member State and a third party, namely NATO, which is an international organisation."
"It is not for the Commission to pass comment on this matter, which lies outside of its remit."
"That being said, the Commission hopes that both parties can reach a workable solution, which would undoubtedly contribute towards further increasing cooperation and strengthening relations between the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance."
"– Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was clear; the point of my question was simply that the common European foreign and defence policy needs to be safeguarded to the maximum possible degree in the bio-strategic country of Cyprus and the reply was perfectly clear."
"– Madam President, very briefly, the Commissioner's reply about this being nothing to do with the Commission is unsatisfactory."
"The European Commission approves the financing of the common European foreign and defence policy and participates in the work of shaping the European Union's foreign policy."
"Apart from this, we also need to say that my honourable friend's question touches on the foreign relations of the European Union and, as we all know, the dividing lines between classic foreign relations and classic foreign policy are not fixed either in the Treaty or when they are exercised."
"Thank you very much for addressing further aspects of this issue."
"I am convinced that it has been going on for some time and that it is more likely to reach a successful conclusion."
"Given the situation over the last decade, developments are rather encouraging."
"In the sphere of the second pillar, the European Commission really does not have direct power with regard to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, but supports the endeavours of Member States not only on joint policy but also on definitive common action with regard to relations with other organisations and with particular regard to security policies."
"I am therefore convinced that, in the hands of the Member States supported by the Union as a whole or, as the case may be, the Commission, this topic can gradually be brought to a successful conclusion."
"At this time, it is not, however, within our powers to do more than the Commission is endeavouring to do."
"What is the time-frame for the incorporation of biometric characteristics into visas, taking into account the time needed to develop and implement the biometric system?"
"What support will Member States receive for the development and implementation of their own systems, with a view to guaranteeing interoperability with the planned centralised system?"
"Looking ahead to the implementation of the new system, what progress have the Member States made with the introduction of biometric characteristics?"
"Does the Commission take the view that compliance with the relevant data protection laws can be guaranteed?"
". The Commission’s proposal to amend Council Regulation 1683 provides common security standards for visas and the storage of two biometric identifiers on a storage medium with a sufficient capacity."
"However, tests have shown that technical problems occur when a chip is introduced in each visa sticker."
"The Council has therefore decided to anticipate the storage of biometric identifiers in the central part of the visa information system and to consider, at a later stage, whether the additional storage of biometric identifiers and the visa sticker or an additional separate smart card would be necessary."
"The Council invited the Commission on 24 February 2005 to make every effort to enable the storage of biometric identifiers in the central part of the visa information system from 2006 onwards."
"The decision on the additional storage of biometric identifiers on the visa sticker will largely depend on pilot testing, which is currently being carried out."
"The results of this project can be expected shortly."
"In the meantime, the Commission is cooperating closely with the Member States which are responsible for the conversion of VIS into the national structure."
"The Commission is currently preparing, in close cooperation with Member States, an interface control document which ensures interoperability."
"The call for tender which the Member States may publish for the national part of the VIS will be based to a large extent on this interface control document."
"The Commission is confident that all Member States will be ready to connect their national systems to the central part of the VIS as explained until end 2006."
"As far as consular posts are concerned a roll-out plan for the entire project development period becoming operational at the end of 2006 and further development between 2007-2013 should be prepared in cooperation with Member States."
"Finally, the Commission considers that the Commission’s proposal to amend Council Regulation 1683 respects all data protection issues."
"In accordance with the data protection directive 95/46, the Article 29 working party has been consulted and had given its opinion on 11 August 2004."
"This opinion will of course be taken into full account in the further legislation process if the additional storage of biometric identifiers on the visa sticker or an additional, separate smart card is necessary."
"As regards the access of law enforcement authorities to the VIS, the Commission’s services are working on the third pillar legislative proposal in the field of data protection."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I recently visited the Australian Parliament, for access to which biometric data are already required, and these make it very likely that checks will be carried out efficiently."
"Do you think we could test these biometric data out in the European institutions in order to see whether such a system would actually be a practical proposition?"
". Madam President, I am obviously unable to give you a tangible answer today."
"Without doubt, the two requirements that we have to take into consideration are, firstly, the reliability of the technical criteria that have been adopted by the Australian Parliament, and, secondly, interoperability and thus the ability to make these data actually function for a system that has to extend to the 25 Member States."
"As I have already said, extremely complex technical trials are underway."
"We will of course take into consideration the experiences of other countries at technical level, but I obviously cannot anticipate a final solution today."
"Commissioner, I recently had the opportunity to view the biometric system that has been introduced at Amsterdam airport to eliminate passport controls between Schengen and non-Schengen areas, which seem to me to work extremely well."
"Has the Commissioner had the chance to examine that system?"
"If so, does he believe that it could be spread, on a voluntary basis at the moment, to a network of European airports?"
". Madam President, as I have already said, we will of course also take into account trials already successfully completed in some European countries, particularly within airport systems."
"I am unable to tell you whether that particular system is considered, as one might say, exportable, that is, reproducible on a large scale for a European Union of 25."
"I can assure you that that system will also be taken into consideration in the pilot experiments that will be carried out at a technical level."
"Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner."
"I am also rather curious in view of the efforts currently being made by the German Interior Minister to move the project forward as fast as possible."
"Have the United States excluded the possibility of deferring the deadline once and for all?"
". Madam President, if you mean to refer to the review of the so-called Passenger Name Record (PNR), we have put back by a few weeks the technical meeting between European and US officials, which will take place in July."
"We will obviously inform Parliament of developments, as I in any case promised."
"Given the importance of the media in today's world and the belief that Public Service Broadcasting is worth protecting, can the Commission indicate how it sees the future of Public Service Broadcasting, the need for clear interpretation on how the licence fee is used by broadcasters and whether there is a commonality across Member States in their use of the licence fee as it relates to Public Service Broadcasting?"
". Madam President, the importance of public service broadcasting and the competence of the Member States to define, organise and provide funding mechanisms for this public service are guaranteed by Article 86(2) of the Treaty and by the Amsterdam protocol."
"As indicated in the Commission communication of 2001 on State aid, however, the role of private operators must not be neglected, as they contribute to ensuring pluralism, to enriching the political and cultural debate and to broadening the choice of programmes."
"We therefore very clearly recognise the dual system, which characterises the European audiovisual industry and which has a beneficial effect on the media as a whole."
"With regard to the public sector at present, it is up to the Member States to organise the funding of this sector."
"This funding may come entirely from public funds, in whatever form, and, if appropriate, in the form of a licence fee, as in the example put forward by the honourable Member."
"This funding may also be mixed and consist partly of revenue from the sale of advertising space."
"There is no objection to the choice of one or other of these systems."
"However, the Commission must ensure that the rules of the Treaty are complied with, particularly those on State aid as interpreted in the communication of 2001."
"Public funding must therefore only be used to achieve the public-service mission and must not exceed what is necessary in this regard: that is the rule of proportionality."
"Public-service missions must be defined clearly and precisely and there must be a separation of accounts when public-sector operators become involved in commercial activities: that is the rule of transparency."
"It is therefore not up to the Commission to lay down other rules that would limit the Member States’ room for manoeuvre in this eminently cultural field."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that response."
"I understand that the Irish Government has recently responded to a letter from the Commission requesting clarification on the role and financing of public service broadcasting in Ireland."
"Could you tell us what that response was and what was your initial reaction to the letter?"
". Madam President, I have not yet seen the letter from the Irish authorities."
"I assume that it relates to a normal request from the Commission regarding the completely acceptable State aid allocated to public sector broadcasting."
"This State aid needs to be notified and there needs to be an exchange of questions and answers between the Commission and the Member State concerned."
"In the light of the responses given by the Member State, the Commission assesses whether the situation in the Member States complies with the Treaty, the Amsterdam protocol and the Commission communication of 2001."
"If it does, the green light is given; if it does not, there are discussions between the Member State and the Commission."
"This is a normal procedure that occurs regularly."
"Usually, there are no problems and the Member States are given the green light fairly rapidly."
"Problems have arisen in some cases, in particular with the German authorities."
"With regard to public sector broadcasting, however, the exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission takes place without difficulty."
"The disturbing trend towards media concentration at national level is resulting in monopolies and the dominance of certain television stations and their production companies."
"Given that the MEDIA programme also covers television stations and their production companies (which, it transpires, are neither independent nor small or medium-sized enterprises), will the Commission say to what extent this initiative compromises the fundamental principle of the MEDIA programme, which supports independent producers and SMEs?"
"Will the Commission carry out an assessment of the programme's impact on SMEs, particularly on independent television production companies, and of the practical benefits of using a limited budget to finance the operations of television stations?"
". The honourable Member has raised a number of questions regarding the funding of television channels and of independent production companies by the Media Programme."
"I would like to underline that the Media Plus Programme does not include television channels as direct beneficiaries under any of its schemes."
"In the television sector, independent production companies, which are often SMEs, are supported in the production of audio-visual work for television."
"The aim is to encourage these companies to produce works – any works: fiction, documentaries, animated films – involving no fewer than two broadcasters, preferably more."
"So it is really the European added value which is at stake."
"They also have to belong to different language zones, so it is multilingualism which is at stake – a question that was raised before."
"The Media programmes recognise the precarious existence of independent production companies in a fragmented European market, companies whose economic livelihood often depends on a single project; and a number of the mechanisms therefore target these important creative activities."
"The television distribution funding mechanism was one of the Media Plus Programme actions which was examined in the mid-term evaluation which took place last year."
"This evaluation confirmed the key role played by the various actions for independent producers, as well as that of measures such as eye-to-eye audio-visual and the development action encompassing new talent, single projects and State funding."
"Finally, the second interim evaluation, as requested by the European Parliament in the context of the prolongation of the Media programmes, will be launched very shortly, and will be submitted to Parliament."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply which, I admit, was comprehensive and covered many issues."
"I was commenting basically on the monopoly of numerous means of communication, but I shall move on."
"In order for independent producers to be in a position to retain their producer's rights and in order to be able to secure more easily for them the safeguarding of intellectual property rights and thereby strengthen the possibility of attracting investment from private investors, do you agree that the Commission and the Council should take the relevant steps?"
"As far as I know, no such thing has happened to date and Community directives offer no such guarantee."
"Do you at least have some sort of plan in this direction?"
". The honourable Member has raised the issue of independent producers."
"It is clear that, in the framework of audiovisual media productions, we need these independent producers."
"They are the ones who create the most important audiovisual works, and they do so as part of the cultural and linguistic diversity that forms the true wealth of our continent."
"That is why the conditions for access to subsidies under the MEDIA programme are very clear: it is only open to independent producers."
"Subsidiaries of television stations, for example, cannot receive subsidies."
"I would like to say that MEDIA+ defines very clear obligations, to return to the producers."
"After seven years at the very most, all the systems will be reviewed so that we can provide even better support to independent producers."
"Therefore, thanks to the revision of MEDIA, we are going to strengthen measures that aim to support this very important dimension of the European cultural industry."
"Towards the end of 2005, the Commission will probably submit a proposal for a new directive on television broadcasting, which will deal, inter alia, with the public service aspect."
"Public service radio and television are of great importance for democratic, social and cultural needs in society."
"To enable the public service media to cater for these needs, it is necessary to make it clear in EU legislation that they can use all new techniques and types of media, such as Internet services and WAP services, without contravening internal market rules."
"Does the Commission agree with this view of the right of public service broadcasters to use all new techniques and new types of media?"
"In proposing a new directive, does the Commission intend legislation to be adopted relating only to audiovisual content and not to media types or techniques?"
". Last week, the Commission presented its communication ‘i2010: a European Information Society for growth and employment’."
"In this communication, the Commission states that, by the end of 2005, it will propose a revision of the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ directive to modernise the rules on audiovisual media services, and that is what the honourable Member is referring to."
"Thanks to the minimal coordination provisions it contains, this text strengthens the competitiveness of the European audiovisual media industry."
"Nevertheless, the directive contains no specific rights or obligations for public service broadcasters and there are no plans, at least for the moment, to introduce, as part of the revision process, measures dealing with the use of communication methods and technology by public service broadcasters."
"As in the case of the question that I have just answered, I would remind you that it is very important for Member States to be responsible for defining the purpose of their public services and to determine how those services have to be funded so that they can fulfil their mission, as this field still comes under the subsidiarity principle in accordance with the Commission communication of 2001 on State aid and with the rules of the Treaty, including the Amsterdam protocol."
"However, we also state in that communication – this is also an important point – that the public service may include services that are not programmes in the traditional sense of the word: for example, online information services, insofar, of course, as these services aim to meet the same democratic, social and cultural needs as programmes as such."
"Madam President, I would thank Commissioner Reding for her answer."
"I really do not know, however, whether I should feel reassured or disturbed."
"There is a conflict here between the rules governing the internal market and public service’s ability to function."
"I really want to call upon the Commission to state more clearly than it did just now that public service really is fully able to shape its own activities without this being regarded as restricting the internal market."
"It is extremely important that the Commission take the opportunity to be clear on this issue to the outside world too."
"There is great anxiety because our people are very much in favour of public service."
"Nowadays especially, it is very important to show that we do not believe that the market should take over everything, but that culture and public service should be allowed to continue to play their role."
"Madam President, I can only repeat what I have already stressed: the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"It is therefore the Member States that define, firstly, the purpose and obligations of their public services and, secondly, the way in which these obligations are funded, by licence fees or by advertising."
"The Commission simply checks whether what the Member States have laid down is carried out in practice."
"In 2001, Commissioner Monti and I therefore published - with the aim of answering any questions that could be raised regarding the interpretation of these articles of the Treaty and of the Amsterdam protocol - a communication, which the European Parliament knows well, specifying all these rules."
"I can therefore reassure the honourable Member, because both the Commission and Parliament are committed to the dual system and the public broadcasters are absolutely protected, both by the Treaties and by the rules based on them."
"Annex I to the Luxembourg Presidency's conclusions of 22-23 March 2005 sets out the European Youth Pact which proposes three lines of action."
"Will the Commission make specific proposals and a preliminary assessment thereof in order to achieve the objectives of the Youth Pact, taking into account the need for solidarity between the generations?"
". The March 2005 European Council, in adopting the European Pact for Youth, stressed that integrating young people into society and working life and making better use of their potential is essential for growth in Europe."
"The pact aims to improve the education, training, mobility, vocational integration and social inclusion of young Europeans, whilst facilitating the reconciliation of family life and working life."
"The Commission has responded to the pact without delay."
"It has analysed the possibilities that the pact offers and has made proposals for action."
"We adopted a communication on 30 May this year, which has been transmitted to Parliament."
"At national level the pact, which is an integral part of the Lisbon Partnership for Growth and Jobs, will be implemented through the integrated guidelines proposed by the Commission and to be adopted by the Council in June."
"The guidelines call, , for action to reduce youth unemployment and to increase access to education and training."
"The communication outlines how Member States can implement the pact when preparing their national Lisbon reform programmes with reference to the guidelines."
"The communication draws attention to the demographic changes facing Europe."
"It emphasises the need to foster societies that are child- and youth-friendly and the need for solidarity in creating an inclusive Europe, building on solidarity between the generations."
"It indicates that Member States should follow the integrated guidelines in taking action for achieving a better family and work balance, for example providing facilities for childcare and care for other dependants as part of tackling demographic ageing and a low birth rate."
"The communication identifies actions at European level to support the pact: the use of the Social Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation of vulnerable young people;"
"As stressed by the European Council, the success of the pact depends on the involvement of all actors, especially youth organisations."
"The communication invites Member States to consult young people in developing measures for the pact and following it up."
"It announces the consultation that the Commission will undertake on youth policy, culminating in the Youth at the end of December 2005, to involve Members of the European Parliament and the Parliament itself, as well as young people, Commissioners and other policy makers."
"– I thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was complete and very informative."
"My only question as regards the long list which he gave, which satisfied me completely because it really did cover all the issues, is how all the Commission's plans are to be financed."
". That is a very reasonable supplementary question."
"I had a very special occasion, the day immediately after the approval date."
"The following day we held the first online press conference with youth in Brussels, but also in Member States."
"It was well organised and it is also a contribution to better communication, and to the engagement of young people as we call for future EU policies."
"Part of the answer on support is that we would like to use many opportunities in different strands or areas of EU policies – in social policy or strategy, in rural development, in research and of course in education programmes and training and mobility."
"There is a list of programmes which are connected and there should be an even more coherent way of supporting action vis-à-vis youth, with youth, and for youth."
"We also have a special programme for youth and I hope it will be further strengthened for the next seven years."
"Again it is about the financial perspective."
"So the most important thing, I would say, is the financially unmeasurable part, which means a more coherent, more supported approach towards youth as a part of Lisbon, as a part of integrated guidelines in all the different areas, supported also by financial resources."
"If the attitude of Parliament is the same in this direction - and I would also like to welcome the last report by Mr Böge, which will be voted on tomorrow, the report on the financial perspective - that is a signal in the right direction as regards your question, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou."
"What role does Commission support for cultural measures play in the context of cross-border cooperation, for example between Bavaria and the Czech Republic or between Austria and Slovakia?"
"What specific measures does the Commission plan to take to protect the shared cultural heritage in border areas?"
". Article 151 of the European Community Treaty, which is the base for our cultural cooperation, states that the Community should encourage cultural cooperation between Member States, including in the area of safeguarding cultural heritage and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action in a certain number of areas."
"This objective is pursued by the Culture 2000 Framework Programme in support of cultural cooperation in Europe."
"Implemented in order to encourage artistic and cultural cooperation in Europe and to drive forward the creation of a common cultural area, the Culture 2000 programme supports projects jointly produced and financed by at least three operators from at least three countries taking part in the programme."
"However, this programme is not specifically aimed at developing cross-border cultural cooperation."
"Secondly, while the programme does not establish specific measures for the conservation of the common cultural heritage of border regions, it nevertheless contributes to disseminating know-how and promoting good practices in the field of conservation and preservation of this common cultural heritage."
"Moreover, the European Union also actively supports the conservation of Europe’s cultural heritage through the structural funds and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development."
"Thirdly, in the Interreg IIIA programmes, including those mentioned by Mr Posselt, culture is mainly promoted by supporting networks for creating or intensifying cross-border cultural contacts."
"Under the entrepreneurship measures, many programmes also cover the promotion of cultural tourism."
"According to the guidance given in the Commission Communication of 28 April 2000, renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy, can also be promoted."
"This strategy, of course, excludes housing."
"Mr President, there are two things I would like to mention, one of them being the reference to historic urban centres."
"That was very interesting, and I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the excellent reply."
"There is in the Czech Republic a castle, now wholly dilapidated, which was the childhood home of the originator of the European ideal, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, and in it a European centre for meetings and activities is to be set up."
"This could be an important project."
"Secondly, it is my belief that a great congress or conference should be mounted to serve as a sort of fair or contacts forum for all those engaged in cross-border work."
"A very large number of initiatives are underway in this field, all of them unaware of each other’s existence."
"One possible venue for this might be the capital of your own country, Commissioner, the only capital city to be situated on a border."
"I therefore propose that a meeting of these cross-border initiatives be organised in Bratislava, the former Pressburg."
"After enlargement, there are many more opportunities to show that this new enlarged Community has much in common in terms of history and culture."
"In future, by promoting specific actions, cooperation on all levels and building networks, I am sure that Central Europe will be discovered anew after enlargement, because it has a much potential to offer people to feel like members of one broader European family."
"Thank you for the idea and for all you are doing in this area of promoting cross-border cooperation and togetherness."
"Questions 39 to 44 will be answered in writing."
"During a debate on 25 January 2005, Prof. Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, Chairman of the Consultative Committee for the Fusion Programme, said that nuclear fusion could be generating power commercially in 40 years' time, provided that a heavily subsidised programme was adopted."
"The 7th Framework Programme allocates more funding to nuclear energy (fission and fusion) than to renewable energy."
"Yet the European Council considers that by 2020 greenhouse gas emissions must fall by 15-20% in relation to the 1990 level."
"Moreover, the Commission predicts a worldwide rise in employment in the renewable energy sector, which should be providing several million jobs by 2020."
"Is it desirable, as part of climate and employment policy, to change the emphasis of the research and development budgets from nuclear energy towards renewable energy, and does the Commission have specific plans for this?"
". The EU leads the world in the fight against climate change."
"It has taken a leading role in the implementation of the Kyoto agreement and is equally instrumental in addressing the global debate on post-2012."
"However, it must be stressed that the EU cannot solve the world’s energy and climate problems alone, a fact recognised in the conclusions of the Council of 22-23 March, also referred to by the honourable Member, which set out the objectives for all the developed countries and not just the EU."
"The objective of reducing greenhouse emissions must be set in the context of sharply increasing global energy demand, which is predicted to rise by 60% by 2030, and increasing concerns over energy dependency in the geopolitically unstable regions of the world."
"European energy research thus has to face the threefold challenge of ensuring security of energy supply over the short, medium and long term, enhancing competitiveness and winning the battle against climate change."
"No single technology can provide the solution; a broad technology portfolio approach is required, embracing actions with a relatively short term perspective and others with a much longer term view."
"To achieve the goal of a more sustainable energy system, energy research has to strike a balance between increasing the efficiency, affordability, acceptability and security of existing technologies and sources of energy, whilst simultaneously aiming at a longer-term paradigm shift in the way Europe generates and consumes energy."
"In this equation, nuclear technologies will continue to play a role, along with the increased uptake of renewable energy sources and other clean energy technologies such as hydrogen and fuel cells and CO2 capture and storage."
"Nuclear fusion currently contributes 16% of the EU's energy supply and is, along with renewables, a major source of carbon-free electricity."
"Moreover, key objectives of the Community research programme on fusion concern the safe management of nuclear waste, the operational safety of nuclear installations and radiation protection, which covers a wider field than energy, such as medical uses."
"Fusion has the potential to make a major contribution to the realisation of the sustainable and secure energy supply for the EU within a few decades."
"Recent technical studies suggest that an adequately funded fast-track fusion development programme, including ITER, could lead to the operation, within thirty years, of a demonstration fusion power plant through which the commercial viability of fusion energy could be established."
"In view of the scale and technical challenge of this technology, it can only be pursued at Community level, and indeed, for a major initiative such as ITER, at global level."
"It is recalled that in the conclusions of the March meeting, the European Council also invited the Commission to forge ahead with ITER, to start its construction before the end of 2005."
"However, it is clear that the Commission's proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme also puts strong emphasis on non-nuclear energy in general, with a significantly increased the budget compared to the Sixth Framework Programme and an emphasis on renewable energy sources in particular."
"Generally, the share of Euratom in the total Framework Programme drops from 7.5 % in the Sixth Framework Programme to 5.9% in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The renewables are recognised as being key technologies for Europe in that they are indigenous sources of energy and can be adapted to different regional conditions."
"Renewable energy sources for electricity generation, fuel production and for heating and cooling are all given a high profile in the Commission's proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, within the broader portfolio approach mentioned earlier."
"As a comparison, the overall level of funding for non-nuclear research is more than four times as much as for fusion."
"The potential for job creation in the renewable energy sector must be fully exploited, not only through increased research and development, but also through the adoption of policy measures at European and national levels, to facilitate their penetration into the market."
"Currently more than 100 000 jobs have been created in Europe in the wind and solar photovoltaic sectors alone."
"This is a good illustration of the growth potential that can be harnessed through the combination of Community research effort and policy measures, such as feed-in tariff schemes and green certificates."
"The Commission will therefore continue to provide a substantial level of support to the research and deployment efforts of renewable based energy systems."
"It fully expects that they will secure a larger share of the energy mix through the resulting improved technological solutions."
"Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his response, and I am delighted with his all-out support for renewable sources of energy."
"I think this marks an important U-turn."
"While I think that the European Union has for far too long opted one-sidedly for nuclear energy and, above all, for nuclear fission, I am not certain whether I heard the Commissioner correctly when he said that 16% of our electricity supply would, in future, be derived from nuclear fusion."
"This is how this figure came through in translation, and I am really amazed by it."
"I should like to have this clarified."
"What are the prospects for nuclear fusion and what is the timeframe involved?"
". The reference to 16% was in the context that nuclear fusion currently contributes 16% of the European Union’s energy supply."
"We believe that when we talk about the future, we have to talk about three major principles."
"Sustainability and ensuring that we do all in our power to be environmentally friendly should be part of our philosophy."
"That philosophy underlines all our research programmes in the fields of environment, energy supplies and transport."
"We believe that should be our guiding principle."
"Is the Commission aware of the need for more research into deafness and hearing impairment in children, in terms of both the numbers affected and the treatments and care available and the effectiveness of diagnosis at birth or early infancy? Will the Commission include this issue in the 7th Framework Programme?"
"Madam President, on a point of order: since I am in the House and the Commissioner has taken such a long time over his replies, would it not be possible, as a courtesy, to allow two more questions?"
"Very few questions have been answered."
"Firstly, Mr Mitchell, I did not give you the floor; secondly, I had already indicated that we were running late, and thirdly, I would suggest that we should all spare a thought for our friends in the interpreters’ cabins, who have now worked long in excess of their usual hours."
"That leaves me with no other option but to move to our last question, which is Question 46."
". The question on deafness and hearing impairment is extremely important."
"According to the Eurostat publication, ‘Key data on health 2002’, it is true that at present there are no data on the prevalence of deafness, hearing impairment, nor on tinnitus in the European Union."
"However, the Commission agrees that it would be important, as a measurement of a significant aspect of health status, to have comparable and accurate data on such impairments."
"It would also be useful to evaluate screening, care and treatment available and to develop preventive strategies."
"In terms of research, the Commission has given the issue a great deal of attention both in the previous and current framework programmes."
"As an example, under the fifth programme, the ‘Hereditary deafness’ project – with an EU contribution of EUR 2.8 million and coordinated by the Institut Pasteur in Paris – led to the discovery of half of the genes causing hereditary deafness once mutated."
"This project strongly contributed to the development of new diagnostic tools to identify these genetic defects early after birth."
"More recently, a large FP6 integrated project, Eurohear – coordinated by Inserm in Paris – addressing deafness and hearing impairment just started in December 2004."
"This project receives a European Union contribution of EUR 12.5 million."
"It has the objectives of providing fundamental knowledge about the development and function of the inner ear, and identifying the molecular defects underlying hereditary hearing impairments."
"Achieving these objectives will facilitate the development of therapies for alleviating hearing impairment."
"Other projects of a lower scale on hearing impairment and rehabilitation were also funded."
"More specifically, detection techniques of hearing impairment, notably in the new-born and children, were supported in the context of the successive Ahead projects coordinated by Professor Grandori, in Milan, based on the technique of otoacoustic emissions."
"In the context of the Commission’s proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, the fields of advanced diagnostic techniques and handicaps are, like before, still clearly considered."
"In addition – and this is new – child health is recognised as a strategic issue, to be addressed across activities of the health theme, including diagnosis and treatment approaches."
"More specifically, the specificities of children will be taken into consideration in order to foster the translation of clinical research outcomes into clinical practice."
"Although research topics have not yet been identified, research into deafness and hearing impairment in children could mature along these lines."
"That was an excellent, very helpful reply."
"I would like to press the Commissioner a little further."
"As he knows, thousands of babies are born in Europe with a permanent hearing impairment."
"Some 50% of those are not diagnosed until they are 18 months old."
"Some 25% are not diagnosed until they are nearly three years old."
"As a result of that late diagnosis, permanent damage is caused to those young lives."
"What we now know is that if you have a new-born hearing screening programme, you can give new hope to those children, real potential for them and my plea is that the Commissioner finds a slot within the seventh programme to develop that knowledge further."
". The problem will be given serious consideration."
"I agree fully with the honourable Member that this is one of the problems that commands our full attention."
"Questions 47 to 88 will be answered in writing(2)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report by Mr Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged Europe (A6-0140/2005)."
". Mr President, this report on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged European Union is an extremely wide report."
"From the title, Members of this House could see almost immediately that we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs were dealing with two very big areas."
"Firstly we were dealing with extending and deepening the definition of what it means to be a minority in the enlarged European Union."
"But we were also dealing with unfinished business: we were dealing with the response to the Green Paper on anti-discrimination."
"Both areas are extremely wide and probably required reports of their own, but we have tried to put these issues together in one report and I hope I have touched on the key issues, however difficult they have been."
"Because this has been a difficult report, I want to thank at the very outset the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues in the Chamber today for all their help in meeting the aims of this report."
"It has been difficult and there are one or two issues still to be sorted out before the vote tomorrow."
"But let me return to the substance of this report."
"I care very passionately about ensuring that there is a definition of what it means to be a minority in the new enlarged European Union."
"We know that the protection of minorities was part of the Copenhagen criteria for enlargement of the European Union, but equally we realise that there was no real standard for minority rights in the European Union and in Community policy."
"And because of this gap, we wanted to ensure that this report took at least one step forward in attempting to make that definition."
"That definition is a very wide one."
"It includes all the traditional definitions that we understood in the existing 15 Member States under Article 13 of the Treaty, where we talked about minorities which suffered from disabilities, the issue of age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin."
"But in the enlarged European Union we also have to understand that we are talking about traditional minorities: linguistic minorities and national minorities."
"It is also important to understand the changing nature of the European Union."
"A recent debate in this House on the Roma identified that minority as probably the largest in the European Union and deserving of a rapid and deep response to the problems that they face."
"So this report tries to take on two areas."
"I shall deal with each of them."
"First, the response to the Green Paper and Article 13."
"Here in my report I find that the implementation and transposition of the existing directives which the Commission brought forward and this Parliament voted through, and the strengthening of legislation in relation to discrimination on the grounds of disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin, was far too slow."
"Too many Member States have failed to implement existing directives, and although the legislation is very good and some Member States have transposed it, there is insufficient will in the European Union to transpose what already exists."
"I hope this report will take one step further with the Commission – and I know the Commission has been making strides on this in bringing Member States to account, but I hope that Member States will see for themselves the benefit of transposing this legislation."
"Article 13 legislation, the race equality directive and the employment directive are valuable because they can apply equally to the Roma minority, as they do to second or third generation ethnic minority migrants in Britain or France or Italy."
"And that is the beauty of this legislation: it is easy to transpose."
"But it needs the political will of the Member States in order to implement it."
"On the definition of minorities, here we have to take seriously the question of traditional, national and linguistic minorities."
"We have to understand that there are many people in the European Union who want to protect their diversity, but they feel they are a minority and therefore vulnerable."
"This report seeks to look at those areas, not to impose solutions on Member States, but to have a standard in the European Union that says that if you are a minority you are also a European Union citizen worthy of respect and worthy of carrying on your own cultural traditions, language or whatever it may be."
"Finally I want to say that this has been a difficult report but we have to identify that the way any Member State treats its minorities is a measure of how advanced that Member State really is."
"This is a very important test."
"We saw it in the Copenhagen criteria and we should see it today: that a Member State can be measured by how it protects its minorities, how it protects diversity within its population."
"We in the European Union already have the legislation to do this."
"We must use it, and we must develop a definition of minorities which everyone can accept."
"There have been difficulties in this report, but I hope that definition will be broadly acceptable to all Members across this House."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Moraes for his excellent report and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment for their invaluable contributions."
"The promotion of fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination and for equal opportunities are a priority for the European Commission."
"At his own initiative, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, established a group of Commissioners that is to develop the European Union’s policy agenda in these areas."
"Your report, Mr Moraes, has drawn to our attention the need for further steps to solve the problems of discrimination and the situation of minorities in the European Union."
"The Commission shares a number of fears mentioned by Mr Moraes and other Members of Parliament."
"Today, the European Union’s anti-discrimination regulations are among the most advanced in the world."
"Two significant directives were adopted in 2000, which ban discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin, religious belief or conviction, age, disability or sexual orientation."
"These directives extended the broad range of Community regulations in the area of discrimination on the basis of gender."
"As your report correctly noted, our main task will now be to ensure that these regulations work effectively throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe; in other words, that the process of implementing the regulations must be concluded at national level."
"Certain Member States have, however, failed to meet the deadlines set."
"The Commission takes its role as a guardian of the Treaties in this area very seriously, and has on a number of occasions taken action against Member States for failing to meet their obligations."
"We must similarly ensure that people are aware of their rights, and that they are able to derive full benefit from them."
"Awareness-raising is a priority for the Commission, and we therefore propose that the European Union designate 2007 as being the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"This European Year will be an important opportunity to mobilise all participants and to emphasise the benefits of European diversity for the economy as well as for society as a whole."
"I hope that we shall be able to rely on the support of the European Parliament for this proposal, and on your active participation in this European year."
"In 2004, the European Commission carried out a broad public consultation on the Green Paper on equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged European Union."
"National bodies, organisations concerned with equality, non-governmental organisations, social partners and the general public sent more than 1 500 reactions."
"We are very pleased that we can take into account the opinions and reactions of the European Parliament in the questions considered in the Green Paper."
"With regard to the Green Paper, the Commission adopted an announcement on non-discrimination and equal rights for all."
"This announcement describes a framework strategy for future activities in this area."
"This strategy goes beyond merely protecting the rights of individuals, and explores how the European Union can promote positive measures to support the integration of social groups facing considerable structural obstacles to their participation in society."
"The Commission will also assess the potential impact and workability of new measures to complement existing European Union regulations in the fight against discrimination."
"This study will take account of the relative benefits of legislative and non-legislative measures and the costs and benefits of various alternative policies, as well as the need to take care not to open a discussion on the existing legal framework, which might weaken the current level of protection against discrimination."
"The Commission is in particular worried about the unusually serious situation concerning the exclusion of and discrimination against Roma communities throughout the European Union, including in the accession and candidate countries."
"The European Union is now trying to resolve these issues, for example, by using its anti-discrimination legislation and the targeted use of the European Union’s financial resources."
"This is an area in which the Union cannot act alone, however."
"A joint effort of international organisations, Member States’ national bodies, and representatives of citizens’ groups is needed."
"However, I agree that we should evaluate the most effective way of using the Union’s policies and policy programmes to support the inclusion of the Roma."
"As the President, Mr Barroso, has confirmed, a group of Commissioners dealing with fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities will consider this question at a future meeting."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate my honourable friend Mr Moraes for his bold approach to the question of discrimination."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would be happy if we were in a position today to speak about development, cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and a rational and fair distribution of wealth generated."
"Unfortunately, however, all this looks more like a theoretical approach to reality which, in its every expression, worryingly unfolds more and more forms of discrimination."
"The vision finds a strong adversary everywhere."
"It is precisely economic liberalisation which is the most basic cause of the exacerbation of economic inequalities, which promotes individual activity to the detriment of social collectiveness."
"It is economic liberalisation which is the most basic factor, which strengthens xenophobic tendencies, which dynamites industrial relations and creates new armies of the unemployed, which reinforces a particular form of social racism against the elderly and the disabled."
"It is therefore economic liberalisation which is the most important ally of discrimination, the combating of which needs to be placed at the centre of our political practice."
"It is also obvious that the recent refusal by the French and Dutch people to accept the draft Constitutional Treaty conceals causes which are closely connected with some of the existing forms of social discrimination, such as unemployment, poverty and anxiety about the future of the welfare state."
"To conclude, over and above theoretical texts, we need to proceed in essence, in practice."
"We need to give coming generations a society in which colour, creed, sex, origin or sexual preferences are not reasons for discriminatory treatment."
"We need to fight for a social Europe which places people first, a Europe of participation which invests in education, full employment, quality of life and the elimination of poverty."
"We owe it to the children of the entire world."
". The work of the rapporteur in this case has been groundbreaking and I would like to thank him for this."
"It is true that several of the reports touch on anti-discrimination, but this one has gone a step further than previous reports."
"Protection of minorities means more than simply prohibiting discrimination; it takes political thinking a little closer to creating equal opportunities."
"However, when the two issues are linked together, numerous problems arise, and so the report has ended up rather large; the issue is complex and so the report examines a whole raft of new connections."
"The report deals first of all with protection of minorities."
"Since minority rights are an integral part of human rights and the latter are among the incontrovertible fundamental values of the European region, there is no doubt that the issue on the agenda is unquestionably important and inevitable."
"In an enlarging Europe, it is only fair that the problem of dual standards should arise in connection with an issue such as this."
"While the Copenhagen criteria clearly set out EU expectations with regard to protection of minorities, Member States have not so far been obliged to adjust their policy on minorities accordingly."
"In the new Member States, which have been bringing their policy on minorities into line with Europe prior to accession, there is a danger that a rise in nationalism might not only bring this process to a halt, but also lead to an increase in anti-minority incidents."
"This is why a monitoring system is indeed needed."
"The specific problems that arose in the course of preparing the report – problems relating to the varied situation of different minorities on the one hand and the universal nature of human rights on the other – were a clear indication that we need a policy like this within the Union."
"I strongly endorse the section of the report that emphasises that this policy must be based on the fundamental European principles of subsidiarity and self-governance."
". Mr President, one of the primary expectations of the citizens of the European Union is better protection of their rights."
"Indeed, we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect one’s representatives and to live as one wishes can have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity."
"The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty is a considerable step forward for European citizens."
"It shows that the protection of citizens’ rights is at the heart of European integration and Article 1 restates the prime importance of human dignity."
"The Charter thus also has real legal significance."
"Let us hope that this will be the case."
"The report by my colleague, Mr Moraes, points out the importance of fundamental rights and, in particular, of the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe."
"We note that, unfortunately, Article 13, which gives the Community the mission of combating all forms of discrimination, and European legislation in this field, have been implemented poorly or partially by the Member States."
"It is therefore, above all, absolutely necessary to ensure better transposition, better application of European legislation in this field."
"We also think that effectively combating discrimination goes hand in hand with a common, coherent European integration policy."
"Finally, poverty and social exclusion are a form of discrimination and the eradication of poverty must form part of the policy of combating discrimination."
"We must put in place mechanisms giving people suffering from exclusion and poverty appropriate access to employment and housing and ensuring that they are represented within the political bodies."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a tremendous and at times nerve-racking job that he has been doing."
"He has been working on very interesting subjects."
"With the enlarged European Union we are looking at completely new questions."
"I have personally come to realise that where the United States might be a melting pot, the European Union is a very rich, colourful and beautiful mosaic of diversity."
"It is something to be proud of and to cherish."
"We have taken the first steps on the path of a very important discussion."
"The European Union has to respect minority rights, but we should not forget that ultimately each citizen is also an individual and each citizen is therefore entitled to the same rights; secondly, that the European Union should respect the cultural identity of minorities and, at the same time, we must ensure that does not prevent full integration and participation in the community."
"With regard to the issue of non-discrimination, unfortunately after so many years it is still necessary to have this debate."
"As the previous speaker said, there are still many groups, such as women, who face discrimination and who lag behind."
"I should like to focus, in particular, on one paragraph that raised some concerns: the paragraph on the rights of gay people."
"We should be fair to ourselves here."
"Fundamental rights are for all citizens, not just for some groups."
"If we are serious about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that says we should not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, then we cannot possibly vote for the amendment tomorrow that seeks to delete a paragraph on homophobia and obstacles to freedom of movement."
"This morning we talked about terrorism and the right balance with fundamental rights."
"I would therefore hope that this House will wholeheartedly endorse this report tomorrow."
". Nowadays, when the crisis of the process of European integration has become evident, I recall the following words of Yehudi Menuhin: ‘Either Europe will become a Europe of cultures or Europe will die’."
"He said that in January 1999 when opening an exhibition devoted to European minorities."
"All of us regularly pass the room where this exhibition took place and which now bears his name."
"We are discussing today and will tomorrow vote on the report on the protection of minorities and non-discrimination policies, which is absolutely essential for the future of the Union."
"This report, as adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is an excellent text showing a real ability to develop the Union as an area in which fundamental rights, including minority rights, are protected effectively."
"Nevertheless this report has been supported by little more than half of the Members of the Committee."
"Moreover it seems that the same split of opinions is taking place all over Parliament."
"Why is this so?"
"Maybe the reason is that many of us have a differing or indeed no understanding of minority rights."
"Surprisingly, we have a consensus when it comes to a number of resolutions telling those outside the EU how to respect human rights and develop democracy, yet we are not ready to support the text saying that these rights have to be respected inside the Union."
"Why do we keep silent when the Member States ignore the spirit of the international treaties protecting human rights, for example, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities?"
"I believe that tomorrow the majority of Parliament will support the text as it has been accepted by the Committee and therefore will support the Europe of cultures."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Moraes for his fine work in preparing this text, because we have a real need in Europe to protect minorities and to generate practical initiatives against discrimination."
"I imagine that at this very time all Members have been subject to real lobbying by EU citizens, even asking us to scrap some of the paragraphs in the Moraes report."
"We often profess to be champions of the minorities, before then demonstrating such hypocrisy when it is a question of religious freedom or of recognising free movement and homosexual marriages."
"Some subject-matters are taboo: there is news today, for instance, that even in Catania, a civilised Italian city, an Italian citizen was refused a driving licence on the grounds of being homosexual."
"I believe that this fact also speaks volumes about the level of guarantees that we have to put in place against discrimination, and that it is also useful to launch an initiative aimed at ensuring that, with regard to minorities, genuine acts of citizenship, and not just tolerance, are guaranteed."
"Mr President, I was not, at the time, in favour of including Article 13 in the EC Treaty; not because I condone discrimination – quite the contrary – but because it is not desirable that this be regulated at European level."
"It is up to the Member States to enact the right sort of regulations."
"It does not surprise me that Mr Moraes, in his report, concludes that the Member States are dragging their heels when it comes to implementing this policy."
"Tackling this at EU level does not seem to add any value."
"Religious convictions are not a personal matter; they must be professed in a community and expressed in one’s attitude to life."
"The way in which it is suggested in paragraph 22 that in the field of education, discrimination would be on grounds of religion, ignores the meaning of religious conviction for the identity of education."
"Finally, I am grateful to Mrs in 't Veld for Amendment 4."
"Discrimination against Christians should be fought with the same tenacity as other forms of discrimination."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur on his enormous efforts in drafting the report, which I believe is still incomplete, however, and certainly not very effective."
"Protecting fundamental rights, which was a key element in the integration of Europe, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, declared in Nice in 2000, confirm the importance, not to mention the necessity, of a coherent integration policy aimed at protecting minorities and encouraging the integration of non-EU citizens, particularly in the light of the recent enlargement."
"We are all agreed in saying that discrimination is a phenomenon that must be fought, that all men and women must enjoy equal rights and that no one must feel discriminated against on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion or any other category."
"I believe, however, that the social inclusion of immigrants, and the protection of minorities and cultural diversity – priority objectives of the European Constitution – do not always have to be achieved at any price in every case."
"Allow me to express my doubts about those immigrant communities that show obvious signs of intolerance – not to say contempt – towards the host country, its customs, its history and its culture; about those who demand unwarranted autonomy and consider it their right to not respect the laws of the Member State in which they are staying, often illegally."
"They are the first not to want to integrate."
"Immigrants certainly need to be given legal status, allowing those whose situation is in order not to be discriminated against, on condition that they clearly demonstrate their willingness to integrate and to actively contribute to the economic and social development of their host country."
"In contrast, by guaranteeing every kind of right at any cost – systematically and unconditionally – there is the danger that the only ones who feel discriminated against will be European citizens, who carry out all of their fiscal and social obligations towards the State, respecting its rules."
"Finally, I must naturally declare my complete opposition to the paragraph on homophobia and gay couples, regarding ‘family’ only in the traditional sense: a male father, a female mother and children as they are born, male or female."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Moraes on his excellent report, and if the nationalists and homophobes attack you, Mr Moraes, do not be afraid, because it will be proof that you have produced a very good report."
"As chairman of the intergroup for traditional national minorities, I would like to emphasise the following points."
"Firstly, the European Union has no system for the protection of national minorities."
"We must draw up legal and political standards for the protection of national minorities and for a monitoring system as Mrs Bauer proposed in her opinion."
"Secondly, we must distinguish between the traditional national minorities of Mr Moraes’s report and the migrant minorities of the Council of Europe."
"I have proposed referring to migrant minorities as new minorities."
"Fundamental rights are indivisible, but the obligations of the State are different: for traditional minorities, we need to guarantee that their identity and language are protected; for migrant minorities, we need to guarantee that they are integrated into society."
"Thirdly, we in the European Union must clarify the relationship between non-discrimination and positive discrimination."
"We have some non-discrimination clauses, but it is not clear."
"What is the relationship between equal treatment and preferential treatment?"
"We cannot guarantee the rights of national minorities without preferential treatment or positive discrimination."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support this excellent report in full."
"Mr President, the new Member States have brought new linguistic and national minorities with them into the EU, which is ever more characterised by linguistic diversity."
"New demands are being made of the EU policy on minorities, which is laudably addressed by the report."
"Already, 46 million inhabitants of the EU now have mother tongues other than their countries’ main languages."
"The fact that the number of MEPs per country decreases when the EU receives new Member States is a problem."
"Then, linguistic and national minorities are the first to disappear from the European Parliament."
"Four minorities disappeared as a result of the last enlargement, and the process will continue if measures are not taken."
"The issue affects the basis of democracy, since everyone should be represented in, and recognised by, the body to whose legislation they are subject."
"As the rapporteur quite correctly says, one prerequisite for an inclusive minority policy is adequate representation in political decision-making."
"Given the way in which the enlargements are now planned, just about all minorities will disappear from Parliament."
"That is not desirable."
"The issue could be solved, for example, by the EU establishing 30 parliamentary seats earmarked for national linguistic minorities."
"Obviously, it could be difficult to decide precisely how these were to be defined, but the problem must not be exaggerated."
"In most cases, we are concerned with population groups that have recognised status in their countries and that are neither anonymous nor invisible."
"Europe’s diversity must be made visible."
"To take away from Europe’s minorities the opportunity of achieving even some fragile representation is a serious matter, affecting the ways in which stability can be secured on our continent."
"Many wars in Europe have been the result of majorities oppressing smaller groups."
"I hope that Parliament and the Commission will tackle this issue."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Moraes for the work that has been done on this very sophisticated report, which, as some have already said, demonstrates the growing complexity of the European Union."
"At the moment we are looking at the question of whose Europe is it that we are creating; and this report, along with others tonight, is very strong on the fact that this needs to be an inclusive Europe, where people have equality of opportunity to fulfil their potential."
"We need to be combating the growing movements we see which are based on hatred and exclusion, something that, for many of us, is absolutely unacceptable within this European Union."
"I welcome the particular recognition given in this report to the work of local authorities and others from the grassroots up, because we are looking at something of a cultural shift which broadens the European Union."
"I echo Mr Moraes’ statement on the Article 13 directives."
"I would hope that the incoming presidency makes that a priority, so that at least the legislation is in place when we come to celebrate the Year of Equalities in 2007."
"Mr President, there is a gap between the EU rhetoric on equality, inclusion and diversity, and the reality of experience across the Member States."
"This report rightly asserts that minority rights issues have not been high enough on the EU agenda."
"The report also reflects the massive amount of work required in this area if we are to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality."
"In my limited time I shall add my voice to two specific calls that the report makes."
"A critical requirement in asserting and protecting minority rights is political will."
"In this regard I echo the report’s call for speedy progress on the Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia."
"Also essential is the availability of comprehensive, reliable and disaggregated data on discrimination."
"The report correctly identifies this area as one meriting immediate action."
"I congratulate Mr Moraes and I welcome the report’s assertion that equal treatment is a basic right and not a privilege, that human rights are indivisible and cannot be bought or sold."
"The challenge for all of us is to put in place mechanisms, and crucially resources, to realise these goals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the importance of the goals of the report by Claude Moraes and noting the personal sense of responsibility displayed by the rapporteur in seeking out the truth, at the same time it must be said that the process of creating the report has once again clearly demonstrated that, in creating a common minorities and anti-discrimination policy in Europe, it is absolutely vital and essential to take into account the special, unique, historical and political situation of each country; the importance for a country of preserving its identity and its jurisdiction in solving issues regarding minorities and discrimination against them must be respected."
"As this report was being written, there were on several occasions manifest failures to observe this rule in the proposals submitted by individual Members who are ignorant or inclined to be biased, that is, in the unjust complaints about the policies on minorities implemented by Latvia and Estonia."
"This is absurd, since the attitude towards minorities in Latvia is no less accommodating than attitudes in other countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, taking into account these repeated open, unjustified and uninterrupted attacks on the two states who have suffered most of all from the totalitarian Soviet regime, I call upon you to understand and acknowledge, at last, that in different cases a solution to problems must be sought which is not standard but that a minorities policy must be created which is individually tailored to the circumstances of each particular state."
"Thus, for instance, our colleague Tatjana Ždanoka began with an attempt to include in all possible wordings of the resolution the issue of non-citizens that is peculiar to Latvia: she tried to highlight it and frighten Europe with Latvia’s over 400 000 non-citizens, and she created the situation that in many parts of the text of the report’s conclusion various legal terms and such fundamentally separate concepts as ethnic minorities, immigrants, refugees, stateless persons and non-citizens, which are not one and the same, are nevertheless confused."
"The result is a reduction in the report’s objectivity and quality."
"It is time to remember that the repression and destruction of the indigenous nations of the Baltic peoples, and the in-flows of economic migrants are the reasons why, during the occupation of Estonia and Latvia, the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of these states changed significantly, giving rise to a comparatively large number of non-citizens with foreign ideologies."
"Latvia has been very fair, and the legislature has, for its part, given special rights to the persons who were settled there during the occupation period – rights to naturalise at any time."
"The fact that many have not wished to do so should be viewed as the expression of their individual wishes, and not as a complaint against these countries."
"Not just the number of citizens but also their loyalty, their respect for the country, its language and its values ought to be the criteria for gaining citizenship and consolidating society."
"Exaggerations should be avoided, and it should be understood that, for example, in the case of Latvia a devalued granting of citizenship under the influence of external pressure would constitute discrimination against the indigenous nation, and its identity and the state’s existence would be at serious risk."
"– Mr President, the protection of minorities should be not only one of the basic political criteria of Copenhagen for candidate countries, but also a dynamic indicator of democratisation and the consolidation of democratic institutions."
"From this point of view, the European Union needs to be the strict judge and controller of the conduct of all candidate countries and it needs to do this without the selective sensibilities and calculations which are often dictated by interests and short-term political expediencies."
"The issue of minorities should not be used to promote national interests or undermine other countries."
"The philosophy of the escalation strategy, which uses religious and ethnic minorities as a battering ram, is a source of tension, conflict and the cultivation of mutual distrust which ultimately turns out to be to the detriment of the minorities themselves."
"Minorities in Europe can play a bridging role for the purpose of cooperation and consolidating security."
"The Moraes report endeavours to give a definition of ethnic minority by referring to the definition of the Council of Europe."
"I believe, however, that what needs to be added to his report, especially in paragraph 7 on the definition, is a clear reference to the international treaties which regulate questions of religious and ethnic minorities."
"An international treaty is a sound basis on which to protect the rights of minorities and a secure framework for overturning policies which exploit them for other purposes."
"With this comment, I should like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the excellent report which he has presented to us and I believe that we should vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"Mr President, I believe that how we treat our minorities reflects the strength of our democracy."
"It has to be said that no Member State is free from defects when it comes to giving substance to universal human rights."
"Unity in diversity is not just a slogan."
"It has to be put into effect because it is essential to human progress in our Member States and, I would argue, to the very survival of the European Union."
"Mr Moraes has worked hard and produced a well-balanced and very good report."
"In Ireland we have still not achieved the progress that we need to achieve in relation to women’s equality, travellers’ and gay rights."
"I know too that other Member States fall far short of granting full citizenship to minorities."
"I know that this is a particularly sensitive issue in Latvia and Estonia."
"However, this report does not seek to be censorious; it attempts to approach these problems in a spirit of solidarity and indeed of seeking help for all states to comply with European values."
"I would urge all Members and political groups of this Parliament to support this."
"I believe it is an excellent report."
". Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your debate with interest."
"I should like to touch upon just a few points, if I may."
"I think it is really important to support and push through the implementation of European legislation in the individual Member States."
"It is apparent that there is still much to do, and I want to state clearly that the Commission takes its role as guardian of the Treaty very seriously."
"I would also like to emphasise the Year of Equal Opportunities, which will give us the chance to raise awareness of these complex and sensitive issues."
"I should like to conclude by saying that I am convinced that the new strategy adopted by the Commission will provide a suitable framework for future anti-discrimination measures."
"It is obvious that what is needed is a combination of all available tools, including legislation, and that it is absolutely necessary to focus in particular on those groups that have unfortunately not yet had the opportunity to participate fully in society and the economy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish once again to congratulate Mr Moraes on his report."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Gaubert on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the links between legal and illegal migration and integration of migrants (A6-0136/2005)."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked a great deal over the last few months to draft a comprehensive and consistent report on some very sensitive topics: my report relates to legal and illegal immigration and integration policies."
"Since time immemorial, humans have emigrated to escape poverty or persecution, in search of happiness, in pursuit of a better future."
"Today, with globalisation and the proliferation of transport options, migratory flows have become denser and more complex."
"They are the result of a new aspiration for men and women throughout the world, to go to work in other countries, to benefit from other experiences."
"They are also the result of inequalities that are present across the world, the result of poverty, the curse of too many regions in the world."
"In the context of national elections, in some Member States, immigration is a recurring theme in electoral campaigns."
"Some countries decide to seal their borders and adopt tough measures, while others regularise thousands of illegal immigrants."
"The European Union seems to be divided in relation to the issue of immigration."
"It is true that each Member State has the right to decide how many immigrants it intends to accept, but Europe no longer has internal borders."
"As a consequence, any national measure has significant direct repercussions on the other Member States."
"It is therefore now essential for the Member States to organise themselves at European level."
"The solution to many of the problems they face must be both European and national."
"Certain political parties systematically make use of election periods to draw prejudicial parallels between insecurity, terrorism and immigration, fostering in our fellow citizens a fear of immigrants and foreigners."
"This is, of course, unacceptable."
"It is vital, firstly, to provide objective, transparent and regular information on immigration policy and, secondly, to launch information campaigns aimed at the population, in order to change people’s perceptions of immigrants as criminals."
"In my report, I wanted to take a responsible, balanced, comprehensive approach."
"Responsible, because we need to deal with these subjects with a greater sense of responsibility: we must not forget that we are dealing with men and women, not with goods!"
"I also wanted to take a balanced approach: the Member States must not base their policies either entirely on security considerations or entirely on a spirit of liberalism."
"We therefore need to transcend national differences and take the heat out of the debate in order to develop a humane and effective European immigration policy."
"Finally, I wanted a comprehensive approach to increase consistency and effectiveness."
"I would like to deal with a number of aspects that I have discussed in my report."
"Firstly, the need for an active policy of co-development to combat the basic causes of immigration."
"Secondly, combating illegal immigration by means of stricter controls at our external borders, dismantling human trafficking networks, harsher penalties, very harsh, for businesses that use clandestine workers."
"Thirdly, legal immigration: if the EU needs to open its borders to legal immigrants in response to the predicted decline in the active population, it must do so in an organised, concerted way."
"Finally, policy on the integration of immigrants: admission and integration policies are inseparable."
"The Member States must implement more proactive policies."
"For their part, immigrants must understand and respect the fundamental values of the host country: learning the language, civic education courses and better integration into the labour market are some of the important elements of this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that immigration is a good thing for the country of origin, for the host country and for the immigrants themselves when it is controlled and co-managed."
"That is the principle of win-win immigration, controlled and managed jointly."
"Neither welcoming all comers nor setting as an objective the myth of zero immigration is a realistic or particularly responsible position."
"Each State must accept immigrants depending on its integration capability, its own interests and those of the country of origin."
"The subject of immigration is too sensitive, sometimes too tragic, to continue to make it the subject of political sparring matches."
"One vision must prevail when we discuss it: where are people in all this?"
"Of course, we have to be realistic, but we must also take into consideration the undeniable human brotherhood and the solidarity that it entails."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must give a strong and unified signal to the Council and to the citizens of Europe so that rapid progress can be made in immigration and integration policies."
"I therefore hope that this report will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority."
". Mr President, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gaubert, on his report, which I feel is extremely balanced and well-structured."
"I believe that it makes an excellent contribution to a European immigration policy, highlighting, on the one hand, the added value of Europe, and, on the other, the importance of close cooperation with third countries."
"I will express a number of opinions on the main points in the report."
"Firstly, with regard to establishing an early warning system, the Commission strongly supports this idea and is drafting a proposal."
"By summer, it intends to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on the development of a preliminary consultation procedure among the Member States for the adoption of measures in the area of asylum and immigration."
"Secondly, with regard to the connection between immigration and development policies, the Commission intends to present a draft communication, again by this summer, in order to develop practical ideas and proposals linking European migration policy with cooperation in the area of development. In this context, particularly sensitive subject-matter will without doubt be examined, such as the so-called ‘brain drain’, which is also an extremely delicate issue for the countries from which the flows of highly-qualified workers originate."
"With regard to measures against illegal immigration, moreover, the Commission obviously agrees with the rapporteur’s approach: our action is directed against any kind of trafficking in human beings, in which illegal immigrants are clearly only victims."
"We are examining proposals for common rules for the dissemination of best practice, with a view to tackling the trafficking in human beings more effectively, by possibly aiming for greater involvement from third countries and promoting closer cooperation between the third countries themselves and the Member States in order to protect maritime borders."
"The European immigrant-return policy also deserves much attention."
"The Hague Programme expressly stipulates the need for European common rules on this matter."
"In all likelihood before September, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a directive incorporating common, transparent rules – which we will obviously examine together – on the immigrant-return policy, which will take full account of the need to respect the fundamental rights of every man and woman."
"When discussing fundamental rights, I do not believe that any distinction can be made between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant: the fundamental right of respect for human dignity applies indiscriminately to legal and illegal immigrants alike."
"We now come to the important subject of legal migration for economic reasons: we are collecting a large number of proposals on the Green Paper issued by the Commission in January, with which you are all familiar."
"A public hearing will take place on 14 June, and on the basis of the outcome of that extensive consultation we will prepare a proposal before the end of the year."
"The proposal – as I have already had cause to confirm in this House – will precisely be the product of a large-scale European debate."
"Another particularly important matter concerns the recruitment – and the facilitation of recruitment – of seasonal workers and workers employed on a temporary basis."
"The importance of economic migration is widely recognised: it can be said that, thanks to a genuine European economic migration policy, immigration can represent an opportunity for Europe and its labour market."
"In some sectors it is even reported that there is a need for certain professionals that cannot be fulfilled by the supply of European workers."
"As the rapporteur also points out, economic migration is without doubt an extremely sensitive subject for the Member States."
"I note with great satisfaction, however, that the European public debate on the Green Paper has in some way eased the reluctance of the Member States, which, in certain cases, absolutely refused in principle to tackle the issue of legal migration at European level, and which have now realised that only a policy of this type can bring about real added value."
"Finally, I would like to expand on the two extremely important topics of integration and the protection of immigrants."
"With regard to the first, you are all aware that the proposal that was drafted by myself and approved by the Commission gives particular prominence to integration."
"In my opinion, integration is an essential part of the European immigration policy."
"In the second half of 2005, I intend to present a communication on establishing a coherent European framework of integration policies."
"I am well aware that integration is essentially a national issue, that is to say, that it is incumbent on the Member States to take responsibility for the actual integration policies, but I believe that Europe must not stop encouraging the Member States and intervening to assist them in their integration policies."
"I believe that without integration, which requires education and access to social services, it is unlikely that we will have a genuinely effective European immigration policy."
"On this point, I call for Parliament’s vigorous support in order to overcome the difficulties that some Member States still have with the idea of tackling the issue of integration partly through European, and not exclusively national, action."
"I say this because later in the year we will discuss the Commission’s proposal regarding a European fund for supplementing, but not replacing, national policies on integration."
"I have referred to the protection of immigrants because two aspects are involved."
"The first is the need to obtain reliable data and statistics on immigration."
"The Commission intends to present a proposal for a regulation laying down the criteria for obtaining statistical data that in many cases we do not currently have, making it extremely difficult to outline a European policy."
"The protection of immigrants will have to be aimed primarily at the innocent victims of the traffic in human beings, organised by criminal gangs: I am referring in particular to women and children."
"With regard to these two categories of particularly vulnerable victims of the traffic in human beings – as I have mentioned on other occasions, including in this House – the Commission will present specific protection and safeguard proposals, in order to stamp out trafficking in human beings, on the one hand, and to protect the victims, on the other."
"Mr President, I will conclude by confirming my personal satisfaction with Mr Gaubert’s report, which demonstrates how important Parliament’s contribution can be. With regard to the subject-matter in question, Parliament has adopted a stronger and more incisive political approach than in the past."
"On this matter, I believe that Parliament will be able to be of very great assistance to the policies of the Commission, which will obviously take account of the voice of Parliament."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have put a great deal of effort into this report, because we have reached a turning point in European immigration policy."
"We want to send a clear signal in favour of a fair and equitable European immigration policy."
"A common European immigration policy is necessary so that people arriving in Europe can be welcomed in a dignified and organised manner."
"This policy must take account of the needs and rights of the immigrants."
"That is why a common immigration policy cannot be envisaged without an active integration policy."
"I am delighted, in this regard, that we are finally discussing the creation of legal routes for immigration into Europe."
"However, I would take the liberty of warning that we do not want to take this debate in the wrong direction."
"Above all, legal immigration must make it possible to respond to the needs of everybody, primarily the immigrants."
"Under no circumstances must we reduce our considerations simply to the need for workers on the European labour market"
"European immigration policy must be comprehensive, and not sectoral."
"That is why we must take into account our relations with third countries."
"However, the discussion must be based on true dialogue and exchange."
"It would be unacceptable for us to reject our responsibilities with regard to managing migratory flows in third countries."
"Clauses on migratory flows and readmission agreements are not necessarily included in all the association agreements that the European Union concludes."
"I would like to add, finally, that immigration policy and integration policy cannot be separated."
"I call on the Member States to make it possible to implement minimum criteria for integration in Europe."
"These criteria should relate in particular to proper integration into the labour market, the right to training, access to education, access to social and health services and the integration of immigrants into social, political and cultural life."
". I should like to join with those who have congratulated the rapporteur on pulling off what was not a very easy job."
"Sometimes we have a rather schizophrenic attitude to immigration."
"On the one hand we continuously stress the need for more economic integration, while at the same time we further tighten the rules on immigration."
"The result is illegal immigration, human trafficking and abuse of asylum policies."
"We have shameful scenes in Europe of misery, poverty, and even of people drowning on our shores."
"That is unacceptable."
"We need to accept that Europe has become an immigration continent."
"We should actually be welcoming immigrants, people who are trying to improve their lot."
"Those people are not criminals, they are showing initiative."
"People like that have built the United States."
"They are dynamic and strong and we need them."
"These people are trying to improve their lives and that is not a crime."
"We need proper European immigration policies with real possibilities for legal immigration."
"At the same time we need integration policies."
"Immigrants should be fully included in the community."
"They should be enabled to participate fully in social, cultural and political life, whether by actual voting rights or mechanisms for representation."
"My Group is very happy to support the report as it stands."
"It is balanced and will give the necessary support to the European Commission in setting up its policies."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur most warmly on behalf of my group for this outstanding report, which rightly stresses the need for a European policy on immigration, an issue that must not be left, within Europe, solely to the Member States and their occasionally counter-productive self-interest."
"In the area of illegal immigration, too, the report calls for greater cooperation between the Member States, and for the sharing of models of best practice to include the sphere of integration."
"Discussing mass regularisations, the report argues that regularisation should remain a one-off event."
"There are, however, countries in the European Union that have never known one-off mass regularisations of this kind, my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, being one of them."
"As you can see, there is still much to be done in Europe."
"This report calls on Member States to give their neighbours and other EU Member States early warning, and we have tabled an amendment to paragraph 29 to make explicit reference to the need for information on the introduction of restrictive immigration measures to be exchanged and notified within the European Union, in other words not just such measures as mass regularisations, but also the opposite: if restrictive action is taken, that information should be shared within Europe."
"Finally, the report expresses concern about Member States’ tendency to establish ‘preliminary reception centres’ in non-EU states; there has been frequent enough reference in the press to Libya as an example of a country’s inability to guarantee minimal standards for refugees."
"Turning to legal migration, the report stresses that, although this remains a matter for the nation states, these are less and less able to resolve the numerous problems without help from elsewhere."
"These have to do not only with the management of migration, but also with immigrants’ right to integration, and so we have also brought in an amendment to paragraph 51, calling, among other things, for local voting rights and participation."
"I also want to say how glad I am that this report makes explicit reference to honour killings, an issue that needs to be addressed."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank Mr Gaubert, who has worked in committee to draw up this report, which in my opinion raises three important points for tackling the issues involved."
"The first point is to increase the legal immigration channels; the second point calls on us to act on the causes of immigration and not to respond with repression, criminalisation and rejection; the third point demonstrates that the economic approach may not be the only one in the area of immigration."
"I believe that the Gaubert report must contribute to the drafting of the Green Paper."
"I believe, moreover, that it is necessary to try to adopt the proposals put forward by our group, in particular with regard to residence permits for job seekers, the rejection of the Community priority – because there can be no difference in job seeking between citizens of the European Union and citizens of third countries – and, finally, the right to actively participate in political life and in elections."
"I will conclude by expressing a concern: Parliament is carrying out interesting work on immigration whilst the Justice and Home Affairs Council has recently approved closer cooperation for managing migratory flows with Libya, which has now become a privileged partner of ours in the area of immigration even though it continues to offer no guarantees with regard to respect for human rights and safeguarding the right to asylum."
". Mr President, I have heard a number of references this evening to a common European immigration policy."
"I can assure you all that the British people do not want a common European immigration policy."
"In the recent British general election, all the large pro-EU parties made impossible promises about containing immigration."
"Their pledges were incompatible with EU membership."
"The Commission itself said so with regard to the Conservative Party’s asylum proposals."
"But it is internal EU immigration that really demonstrates the futility of their promises."
"Over 130 000 people from Eastern European countries entered the UK between May and December 2004: ten times the maximum official predictions."
"We bear no ill-will to the people of the new Member States."
"But go to London and observe its creaking housing, transport and health systems: it cannot cope with such a large and sudden increase in population."
"Now Spain intends to grant legal status to up to 700 000 illegal immigrants."
"These people will then be free to move to Britain if they wish."
"Spain’s selfish and irresponsible act demonstrates how Britain can have no independent immigration policy inside the European Union."
"Mr President, immigration, integration and asylum are still taboo subjects, particularly in the old EU Member States."
"Everybody attempts to dodge these issues, and this is undoubtedly why there has been no real follow-up to the 1999 Tampere Programme."
"One of the reasons behind the ‘no’ vote in the constitutional referendum in the Netherlands was the authorities’ failure to take the issue of immigration seriously."
"I therefore welcome this debate as an opportunity to hold a frank exchange of views, even though I disagree with a great deal of what is said in the report, and even though I fear that this debate will be anything but frank."
"Politicians are too cowardly to deal properly with the issues of immigration and integration."
"It annoys me when people say that the EU is in favour of legal immigration but opposed to illegal immigration."
"This is entirely hypocritical."
"There is in fact no such thing as legal immigration, because in practice people can only immigrate illegally."
"As few as 5 000 of the 50 000 Poles working in Brussels live and work here legally."
"The figures are even more striking in the case of non-EU citizens."
"It annoys me to hear people declaring war on human traffickers, when we are in fact faced with a more pressing problem in the shape of the people arriving in Europe who are grateful to these traffickers for their services, which unfortunately come at a price."
"We should call a spade a spade, and adopt common European legislation on immigration."
"We should state in plain terms that for the most part there is no such thing as immigration into Europe, and that we believe Christians integrate better than Muslims."
"The truth hurts, but it is preferable to lies, and we should rid ourselves of feelings of colonial guilt."
"We should state the facts and our opinion of them quite openly, and wherever possible, we should provide assistance to the world’s poorer peoples in their own countries, within the framework of intergovernmental programmes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Gaubert on his excellent work dealing with a very complex and at the same time very necessary report."
"It is complex because there are many factors to this problem which, unfortunately, has become an everyday problem –– illegal immigration –– and also combating it by means of legal mechanisms which respond to the legitimate hopes and desires of those who are seeking a better future in our territory."
"It is necessary because the Union –– and this Parliament in particular –– must once and for all provide a clear response, a clear demonstration of our common commitment to resolve a problem which has been knocking on our door for too long without an appropriate response."
"The promotion of legal migratory channels, the application of measures in favour of the proper integration of immigrants and, above all, the fight against illegal migratory flows, are the three axes upon which I believe the Union’s strategy must be based."
"Firstly, we must promote legal immigration by means of responsible policies, and I would stress the word responsible, since the most recent experience, in my country at least, is a clear demonstration of the opposite; ordered immigration within an open society, with stable and flexible mechanisms to provide lasting solutions."
"We are talking about people, ladies and gentlemen, not figures."
"Secondly, we must work for the full integration of immigrants, since that is the only way we can prevent rootlessness, marginalisation and the conflicts which, to an increasing degree and with greater frequency, are arising within our societies; an integration which has a dual meaning –– for the society of destination and for the migrants themselves –– but which, in any event, must be an integral and fundamental part of our common policy."
"Finally, we must combat illegal immigration, clandestine immigration and mafias, that is to say human suffering in general, since, as I said before, we cannot forget that we are talking about people."
"For these reasons, I would appeal for a common political commitment which leaves behind all demagoguery and all unilateral and irresponsible measures which, simply for the sake of an easy vote and without considering the consequences, could jeopardise the progress we have made and are continuing to make in this field."
"I do not think that I am a coward, but it was an honour and a pleasure for me to participate in the drafting of the report and I am pleased that it has won the support both of the Commission and of most of those who have spoken."
"The question of immigration and integration of migrants has been the subject of decisions within the European institutions for a long time."
"Tampere and The Hague gave particular prominence to this set of issues and to compliance with the Geneva Convention, and in late 2003 this Parliament approved an epoch-making resolution in the report by Claude Moraes."
"The present draft – thanks to the sensitivity demonstrated by the rapporteur on this issue – treats illegal migration primarily as a security policy issue and analyses the dual nature of the determining factors of legal migration."
"People arriving from third countries need to be able to live a decent human life."
"Providing this is not just a human-rights obligation for EU Member States; it is also increasingly becoming sound economic sense."
"This new approach to these issues is inevitable under the relaunched Lisbon process."
"It is to the credit of the rapporteur that he analyses economic migration not in a laboratory context, imprisoned by papers, but on the basis of the current economic and social situation here and now."
"Europe is ageing and additional sources of labour are declining; at the same time, meanwhile, unemployment and inactivity are high."
"The lessons from the French and Dutch referenda also indicate that the citizens of the old Member States perceive the presence of workers from the new Member States in their labour markets as a threat and xenophobia accompanied the debate from start to finish."
"Even facts are weak in the face of emotions, however."
"Data from the German research institute DIW show a dynamic increase in the development of economies that did not impose restrictions on labour supply reinforcements arriving from the new Member States."
"It thus makes economic sense, too, if workers from the new Members States are no longer kept in quarantine for six years and if they are not put in some intermediate, second place between workers from the old Member States and those from third countries."
"It is to the credit of the rapporteur that the report avoids the temptation of opting for easy solutions, such as introducing a quota system or a sectoral basis for accepting immigrants."
"It proposes means for preventing human and economic conflict, improving foreign affairs work and providing effective information."
"It calls upon Member States to use appropriate statutory means to reduce the vulnerability of people making a living from atypical employment."
"For all these reasons, as someone who has been involved in working on the report, I wholeheartedly commend the report to you for adoption."
"Mr President, how can we fail to respect these men and women who, fleeing poverty or dictatorship or war, are prepared to sacrifice everything to reach the European Union in the legitimate hope of a better life?"
"Zero immigration and fortress Europe are dangerous and reprehensible utopias."
"Saying this, though, does not mean that we can just do anything."
"The acceptance of immigrants needs to be organised and prepared."
"In this matter, the EU must play its role, including by providing funding."
"I share the report’s hostility to the setting up of detention centres and to sifting immigrants within the EU or outside its borders."
"I experienced this, sadly, with the notorious camp at Sangatte."
"These centres do not solve anything, quite the contrary."
"They feed tensions of all kinds."
"I agree with the report where it puts forward as a principal aim decisively and mercilessly attacking the people smugglers."
"The same pitiless suppression must be targeted at employers who exploit immigrants completely outside the law."
"On the other hand, I regret the fact that the report presents EU immigration policy as an adjustment variable for the labour market and as a way of pushing down wages."
"Good immigration policy involves a real will to support the sustainable development of emerging countries and not cynically viewing them as a democratic source of cheap labour for the needs of the European Union."
"– Mr President, the report being debated is a complex text which realistically assesses the problems and which lays down the guidelines for a common European immigration policy, both for legal and illegal immigration, and proposes not only repressive but also preventive measures for preventing and repressing immigration, such as supporting countries so that poverty can be combated, education can be reinforced and future immigrants can be helped in their own country."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality helped, with the opinion drafted by my honourable friend, Mrs Kratsa, to ensure that the question of the links between illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, and the need for access to legal and social protection for the victims is emphasised in the report."
"The report, irrespective of whether immigration is legal or illegal, calls for the combating of discrimination and the application of programmes to integrate equal rights for men and women."
"It is positive that, even with non-economic immigration, equal participation in education, training, work and family reunion is called for."
"The report also stresses the need for the Member States to address the continuation in the host country of inhumane traditions which even result in crimes of honour against women."
"It is also positive that attention is paid to the temporary and illegal nature of jobs taken by immigrants, which is something which affects women in particular."
"In the sixth century B.C., the ancient Greek poet Archilogos described abandoning one’s homeland and wandering abroad as one of the most unfortunate situations in which man can find himself."
"The virtue which is in greatest danger, the poet stresses, is not prosperity or health but the dignity of the immigrant and his family."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gaubert, and the Commissioner, Mr Frattini, for the humane note which they have introduced both in the report and in the intervention by the Commissioner; I think that it is positive for Europe that policies are being shaped which will help to maintain and support the dignity and integrity of immigrants."
"– Mr President, the issue of immigration, both legal and illegal, is a huge issue with many aspects."
"It is linked to the combating of racism and xenophobia, to asylum policy, to the integration of immigrants, to the possibility of their obtaining legal employment in host countries and, above all, to trafficking in human beings."
"The European Commission has been addressing this issue since 1986, with the new Single European Act, and has issued a large number of directives and decisions."
"I repeat, therefore, what I said this morning."
"There is an urgent need for all these decisions and directives to be codified."
"Without codification, we are floating in a sea of documents and decisions."
"It has, however, been observed that the Member States either do not implement binding decisions or they are late transposing them into their national legislation."
"This, however, undermines efforts to achieve a single European policy."
"It would be an oversight on my part if I failed to express my warm congratulations to Mr Gaubert on his report."
"This report takes a number of steps forward."
"First of all, it calls on the European Commission to strengthen solidarity and common policies at the level of information and the coordination of all structures involved in migration-flow management."
"However, more important is the highlighting in the report of the need for cooperation with countries of origin and through a proper information system with a view to identifying employment opportunities for persons wishing to migrate."
"Of course, this cooperation must not reach the point referred to by short-lived Commissioner Buttiglione during his hearing because, God forbid that we should create reception centres – I would say camps – in the countries left by migrants."
"It would be a crime which our society cannot accept."
"Mr President, it is true that legal and illegal immigration are linked, as this report rightly shows, but we can hardly address the issue of legal immigration effectively until and unless we achieve a measure of control on illegal immigration."
"There are two major issues of very grave concern here."
"The first is that illegal immigrants themselves are risking their lives, and indeed hundreds are losing their lives, turning the Mediterranean sea into a graveyard and putting us all to shame."
"Even if they do reach Europe, whether in Malta or Italy, their ordeal is not yet over; indeed, it is just beginning."
"The second grave concern is the significant toll that this problem is taking on the countries concerned, particularly on Malta and Italy."
"In the case of Malta the situation is even more precarious because of sheer numbers."
"Last week 56 immigrants landed in Malta, but 56 immigrants in Malta is proportionally equivalent to more than 5 600 immigrants landing in Italy."
"That is the scale of the problem that Malta is facing."
"This year we have reason to be optimistic because for the first time we are seeing the European Union finally responding to our repeated calls for action."
"In particular, I want to refer to last week’s decision of the Council of Ministers to embark immediately on cooperation with Libya to stem the flow of immigrants and to prevent more deaths, not least with the setting-up of a taskforce to patrol the Mediterranean Sea."
"So finally the European Union is starting to move."
"Let us hope that it moves in time."
"I am very grateful to Commissioner Frattini for his very genuine efforts, and on behalf of the people of Malta I would call upon him to act decisively and urgently."
"We are counting on you, Commissioner, to address our very serious concerns."
". Mr President, I would just like to express my thanks to all those who have spoken."
"I can confirm that the work of the Commission will continue in the spirit that is also shared by this Parliament: a European approach that can combine firm action against the traffic in human beings and illegal immigration with strong action in the area of solidarity."
"Europe’s values are values of solidarity and respect for the fundamental rights of every man and woman."
"It is from balancing these two requirements that the added value of Europe can result, even in the sensitive area of migration policies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community (14843/1/2004 C6-0038/2005 2002/0132(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Peillon) (A6-0167/2005)."
". First of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, for his clear analysis of the common position of the Council and the conclusions he draws from it."
"I am very pleased to note that his report shares the view of the Commission that the Union urgently needs a common, effective and balanced approach to the monitoring of large-scale cross-border cash movements."
"I also share Mr Peillon’s view that you are now being presented with a proposal which is clearer and more practical than its predecessor."
"I believe that the adoption of this proposal will provide the Community with a solid measure to enable customs to control significant amounts of cash entering or leaving the Community."
"Member States’ experience shows that cash is being used to avoid controls on transfers by the financial institutions."
"Cash movements are also an easy means of moving terrorist funding."
"Criminals are helped by the fact that we have varying levels of national controls to check suspect cash movements."
"We therefore need these measures to complement the existing money laundering controls to remove the possibility for criminals and terrorists to use this gap in controls."
"The proposal sets out a control mechanism and reporting rules, which require anyone entering or leaving the Community with more than EUR 10 000 in cash to declare the sums carried to customs."
"Failure to declare or the provision of false information will require Member States to verify the bona fides of the movement and take further action as necessary."
"The proposal also sets out a reporting mechanism to ensure that information obtained is handled and exchanged efficiently and with due care."
"In addition, this proposal will also help the legitimate traveller by replacing the existing wide range of national approaches with a clear, simple and straightforward Community system."
"I therefore believe that the proposal you have before you today will close existing loopholes and reinforce our actions to combat terrorism and organised crime."
"The straightforward system proposed means that this will be done without placing an undue burden on the traveller or the national administrations concerned."
"I accordingly look forward to your support for its adoption as soon as possible."
". Mr President, illegal or clandestine immigration does not only involve people."
"It also involves capital and cash, which is worrying for European democracy because there is a link between this money entering and leaving illegally and various types of trafficking: people trafficking, which was discussed in the previous debate, organ trafficking, drug trafficking, and also, of course, terrorism, Commissioner, not forgetting all kinds of transnational crime, which are a concern both for the European Union and for the international community."
"In this context, the Council’s common position and Parliament’s recommendation for this second reading are moving in an essentially constructive direction."
"This discussion started three years ago."
"Parliament had already had the opportunity to express its opinion during the previous Parliamentary term and I think, like you, that the new proposal adopted by a qualified majority of the Council has simplified and enriched the text."
"It is for that reason, moreover, that MEPs supported it and our fervent wish now is, of course, that this text should now be adopted as soon as possible."
"Indeed, this is a subject for which, in the end, the major, widely shared preoccupation must be the effective implementation of the text, in addition to the text itself."
"I think that the text as presented today should provide the legal instrument needed, in particular, by customs officials responsible for these inspections."
"I also think that, with the elements and amendments introduced by Parliament, we now have guarantees regarding respect for human rights and the protection of personal data."
"That is also why I am not especially concerned."
"To conclude, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the constructive attitude they demonstrated during our various meetings and, with the rapporteurs of the other groups with whom I worked, I hope - and I am optimistic - that, tomorrow, Parliament will adopt this resolution unanimously."
". Mr President, this report calls for tight controls on the reporting of cash entering or leaving the European Union Member States."
"It is introduced under the convenient guise of the prevention of organised crime, terrorism and money laundering, but what is its real motivation?"
"An obligation to declare or disclose cash movements could easily be changed to impose an actual limit on the movement of money out of the European Union."
"Yesterday in this Chamber I spoke of the certainty of the eventual failure of the European single currency."
"It is obvious that the proposals in this report anticipate a future crisis of confidence in the euro."
"When that happens the European Commission and European Central Bank will want to prevent the movement of money out of the eurozone."
"To include Britain in these restrictive measures is to couple insult with injury."
"It is yet another reason, if one were needed, for Britain’s unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
". Mr President, before I start my closing remarks I should like to respond to the remark by Mr Batten."
"I should like to draw his attention to the fact that, as far as the Commission and the Council are concerned, we are absolutely certain that the European Parliament had no intention other than to control cash flows in order to combat terrorism and organised crime."
"I should like to comment briefly on the three amendments proposed by the rapporteur."
"The Commission fully understands the rapporteur’s desire to ensure that full and proper attention is paid to the data protection issues."
"That certainly deserves underlining at a time when a range of strong enforcement measures are on the table."
"The Commission considers that the three amendments proposed do not restrict or enlarge the scope of the existing data protection provisions but instead focus attention on the need to apply them appropriately when dealing with travellers carrying large sums of cash."
"The Commission considers that drawing attention to this requirement is positive and would accordingly accept the three amendments tabled."
"Given the Council’s acceptance of these amendments, I consider that Mr Peillon’s report provides us with a real opportunity to bring the lengthy examination of this proposal to a successful conclusion."
"I would hope that you can confirm your support during the vote on this proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"This regulation is just one of the many legal foundations offering a basis for an effective fight against terrorism."
"Terrorism is the metastasis of modern society."
"It is a phenomenon that cannot be controlled by one single measure, but demands a wide range of activities from the Member States and the EU as a whole."
"Although at first glance this regulation will not bring with it any major demands or changes in terms of border controls, it is nevertheless an important piece in the mosaic of measures against terrorism."
"We must be aware that the numerous security measures on the borders and within the borders of the EU can make a significant contribution to a higher level of security and protection against terrorist acts."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, for his level of preparedness and cooperation, and for seeking out the best path."
"I think that this report reflects a good compromise and I support it entirely."
"The next item is the report by Mr Rosati on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (A6-0138/2005)."
". Mr President, today we are debating the proposal for a Council directive amending Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10 of Directive 92/12/EEC."
"I would remind the House that this Directive sets out general rules for the movement and holding of products that are subject to excise duty."
"The latter include mainly alcohol and tobacco products, but also liquid fuels."
"I would further note that Article 27 of the 1992 Directive imposed upon the Commission the duty of submitting a report to the Council on the impact and implementation of Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10 for the period up to 1997."
"For various reasons outlined by the Commission, the report on the implementation of these articles is only being debated today, after a delay of several years."
"I would remind the House that Article 7 relates to the movement of products subject to excise duty by businesses for commercial purposes, Article 8 deals with the movement of products subject to excise duty by private individuals for their own use and Article 9 identifies the threshold at which excise duty becomes chargeable, as well as providing guide levels intended to help establish whether products which have been transported and which are subject to excise duty are intended for commercial or personal use."
"Finally, Article 10 gives details of the arrangements for charging excise duty and the country in which it is chargeable, as well as outlining the duties of tax representatives and the conditions of distance sales."
"A great many doubts have been expressed regarding the provisions of these articles and their practical implementation, not only by private individuals, travellers and tourists, but also by businesses whose professional activities involve trade in and the movement of excisable products."
"This was the reason behind the Commission’s decision to propose a number of amendments to these four articles, and its primary aim was to comply with two basic principles."
"Firstly, the Commission wished to ensure consistency in the implementation of one of the principles of the single market."
"I refer to the fact that excise duty on products moved for commercial purposes is to be paid in the country of destination, whereas excise duty on products moved by individuals who have purchased the products for their own use is to be levied in the country of origin."
"The main aim of the Commission’s proposed amendments to Article 7 is therefore to define movement for commercial purposes."
"According to the definition given, movement for commercial purposes is considered to be any movement other than that for personal use."
"The other amendments to Article 7 serve to simplify the language and to incorporate more accurate terminology."
"Finally, the Commission has also proposed that Article 7 should include a clear indication of the person from whom excise duty is due."
"One of the Commission’s amendments to Article 8 is of crucial importance."
"I refer to its proposal to remove the need for private individuals to transport products themselves in order to purchase the products in question."
"Instead, it will be possible for such individuals to place distance orders for products subject to excise duty, and to have them delivered to their place of residence."
"This also applies to what are known as gifts."
"It amounts to the introduction of a new principle, whereby movement of products for personal use is permitted not only when the products are transported by the individual in question, but also when they are transported by someone else on his behalf and at his expense."
"The Commission is also proposing an important amendment to Article 9, namely that the quantitative limits, which to date have not been used as intended, should be abolished."
"Finally, the Commission is again proposing to amend Article 10 in such a way as to simplify the procedure."
"Your rapporteur is of the opinion that any amendments to EU tax legislation should meet the following four criteria."
"Firstly, such amendments should reflect the thinking behind the single market, or in other words prevent discrimination."
"Secondly, they should be simple and transparent, so that they can be easily implemented."
"Thirdly, they should not cause any major disruption to the tax revenues of individual countries."
"Fourthly, they should also comply with health standards, provided that the individual Member States have relevant policies in place."
"Your rapporteur believes that the Commission’s proposals are a step in the right direction in that they meet these criteria, and I therefore support all of its amendments."
"Parliament’s amendments primarily involve linguistic changes and improvements to the wording of individual provisions, as well as the incorporation of more accurate terminology."
"The House has also proposed that, when implementing these provisions, it should be the government authorities of the individual Member States that bear the burden of proof as to whether products are intended for commercial use."
"Under the current rules, it has all too often been the case that this burden has fallen on travellers, which we believe runs counter to the principles of the common market."
"Without exception, the amendments we have made serve merely to improve the text and to provide what could be regarded as additional explanations."
"We support all the Commission’s amendments."
". Mr President, I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, for his very clear and accurate analysis of the Commission proposal."
"I am very pleased to note that this report strongly supports the proposal of the Commission, the aim of which is to improve the functioning of the internal market in this area, both for citizens and for trade."
"The proposal concerns the so-called ‘duty paid movements’ of excise products between Member States."
"While it is true that this type of intra-Community movement represents only a small proportion of the total intra-Community movements of excisable products, it must nevertheless be stressed that they mainly involve the European citizens and small and medium-sized companies."
"For the European citizens the proposal aims to clarify the existing rules on the movement of goods from one Member State to another."
"Indeed, from the number of questions that the Commission receives daily on this issue, it clearly appears that the present rules, including the value of the ‘indicative limits’, cause some confusion."
"The proposal provides clarification on this issue and also enhances the possibilities for citizens to purchase duty-paid goods in the Member States of their choice, without having to declare those goods and pay duty on them in their own Member State."
"That will better align the system to the principles of a real internal market."
"For goods moved for commercial purposes, the Commission proposes to maintain the basic principle that excise duty is payable in the Member State of destination, but to harmonise and simplify the procedures to be followed in that Member State."
"That will especially benefit small and medium-sized companies such as small wine traders who try to commercialise their products directly in other Member States."
"Today, the complex rules, which differ considerably between Member States, often deter those companies from doing business in other Member States."
"Having regard to the importance of these issues for both citizens and traders, I hope that the positive tone of the report on the table today will be reflected in the vote tomorrow."
". Mr President, Commissioner, a large majority of my group should approve Mr Rosati’s report."
"I will not pretend, however, that the text voted for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs does not bring up a considerable number of difficulties."
"The expression of divergent interests has resulted in a rather shaky overall construction that contains certain inconsistencies, or even contradictions."
"Once again, we have seen how sensitive tax matters still are in the European Union."
"That is why it would be desirable for us to deal with them in strict compliance with the principles that we constantly preach."
"The aim of the Commission’s proposal is to move towards the creation of the internal market, to promote the free movement of goods subject to excise duty and, finally, to respond to consumers by enabling them to make their purchases where they see fit."
"Under these conditions, I am surprised at the proposals of some of my fellow Members which would lead to a situation contrary to this logic, even returning to the situation that existed prior to 1993."
"All of that is surprising and even worrying, but let us return to issues of principle."
"The logic of the internal market very clearly requires the end consumer to pay excise duty in the Member State of acquisition for products intended for private consumption."
"The existence of indicative limits laying down the maximum quantity of goods that can be transported from one Member State to another has become too rigid an obstacle, which has led the Commission to propose that it should be scrapped."
"That is a good suggestion, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has unfortunately only followed partially, as it agrees in principle to the abolition of the limits, but refers, in an amendment, to those same limits as if they still existed."
"Another example of inconsistency is that consumers will in future no longer be obliged to transport the products themselves to benefit from the rule of paying excise duty in the country of acquisition."
"This, too, represents considerable progress."
"For distance sales, in contrast, it is the rule of the destination country that will continue to apply."
"The problem is that the dividing line between the two cases is not always clear and that the differences in their treatment will, I am sure, lead to a number of practical difficulties."
"These considerations led me to propose some amendments that aim to remove the distinction between on-site sales and distance sales, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go with me."
"I withdrew, because I was told that people were not ready and that it would involve a revolution."
"Nevertheless, it would simply be a case of sticking to the logic of the internal market."
"When European integration is proving to be an extremely complicated business – which is the situation we are now in – we cannot continue to encourage these inconsistencies because the citizens of Europe will judge them very harshly."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the review of the current legislative framework is considered unavoidable, because we need to give European citizens and businesses clear, simplified laws."
"Within the framework of this endeavour, I should like to emphasise two points which I consider could play a decisive role."
"Firstly, the present proposal for a directive deletes the reference to guide levels."
"These levels currently operate as single quantitative criteria for the national administrations of the Member States, when they are called on during the importation of products subject to excise to assess if products are or are not being held for commercial purposes."
"The abolition of guide levels will allow the national administrations to each adopt and apply their own criteria for assessing if products are or are not being held for commercial purposes."
"I consider that this is not in keeping with the principles of the internal market; on the contrary, it is a step backwards and a trend towards renationalisation."
"Maintaining guide levels or, where considered expedient, making provision for a study assessing the existing levels or their replacement with new guide levels, would in my view be the proper way forward."
"Secondly, in order to harmonise national legislation and complete the internal market in all sectors, the present proposal for a directive will need to be considered as a transitional stage."
"The final objective will need to be appropriate preparation of national legislation and the internal market, in order to make it possible to harmonise the excise rates imposed by each Member State."
"This is also dictated by the freedom of the markets which governs the internal market."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that the present directive does a great deal to improve the current system."
"In particular, the proposed provisions for improving the definitions of problematic concepts, such as commercial purpose, for including the definition of gifts in products on which excise is paid in the Member State of destination, for distance sales and, finally, for simplifying mechanisms, help in my view to resolve the current difficulties."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, on the integrated proposal which he has submitted on this matter and I think that the House should vote in favour of his report tomorrow."
". The impression is that this perhaps technical question, which we are considering tonight, is in fact related to the problem of governmental policy."
"How can we combine state control with elements of a free market so as to create optimal conditions for economic development?"
"Obviously, there is no simple answer; however, the experience of economic reforms implemented by us, the new members, is solid proof that the best results may be achieved when the problem is tackled in an integrated manner."
"I welcome the Commission’s proposal to repeal the indicative qualitative restrictions that are currently used by customs officers of the countries to determine the quantity of excise goods, as designated for personal use, which is permissible for importation, because such a procedure was contradictory to the essential requirements for the functioning of the common market."
"Indeed, how can we speak about the common market where individuals cannot import goods for their personal use?"
"However, we should not forget the problems related to that matter."
"First of all, the border countries, the Eastern border countries in particular, may face a rise in the flow of smuggled goods because the prices of spirits are much lower, both in Russia and Belarus, and the decision to fight against smuggling should not only focus on the strengthening of border protection."
"I urge the Commission to consider the necessity to reach agreements with neighbouring Eastern states so as to invite them to cooperate in our fight against smuggling."
"The other problem we will encounter is the emergence of a small layer of merchants who will carry spirits from one country to another, for example, from Estonia where the excise duty is low, to Finland where the rate of the excise duty, and, respectively, the prices, are higher."
"The solution to this problem can hardly be found without an integrated approach towards the development of border regions and the creation of new jobs, so as to provide those people with an opportunity to earn their living in another way."
"Thus, the economic measures that may contribute to the prevention of negative consequences are always available."
"Moreover, scientists have proved that the creation of a common market offers many more advantages; that is, GDP per capita in the European Union is higher by 20 percent owing to the presence of the common market."
"Hence, the advantages outweigh some problems that will emerge as the provisions of this decision are applied."
"Mr President, the current minimum tax level for alcoholic drinks may be as low as zero, but other countries have chosen a higher tax level, mainly for health reasons."
"Through unfair tax competition, unlimited movement imposes, in principle, upon all countries the policy applied by the Member State with the lowest tax."
"That would be the effect if we were to use the term ‘personal use’ without a time limitation."
"Because many alcoholic drinks may be stored for a lifetime, anyone can maintain that a lorry-load of such drinks is for personal use for the next 40 years, an option that would allow smugglers to go free."
"With a 120-day principle, account could be taken of, for example, birthday parties and of differences in levels of consumption between one country and another, but there would still be a legal reference to what might be regarded as reasonable in terms of personal use."
"Voting down this amendment would, in practice, amount to a ban on all EU countries taking any measure whatsoever to combat tobacco and alcohol consumption for health reasons."
"That can scarcely be the intention of this House, because it would be in conflict with Article 30 of the Treaty."
"Mr President, in his English Dictionary of 1755 Samuel Johnson defined excise as ‘a hateful tax’, and this tax and the way it is policed have become a hate object also for my Scottish constituents."
"They call me in tears to describe having their cars dismantled and their children terrified by customs officers."
"Okay, they are told, you can appeal to the courts – except that they cannot afford the courts against the customs’ bottomless pockets, and the burden of proof falls on them."
"And what good do these exaggerated excise taxes do?"
"They victimise honest retailers who cannot compete with personal purchases abroad, and the much more serious smuggling by organised crime which these taxes promote."
"They actually reduce overall tax revenue."
"And then there is the cost of all those extra customs inspectors."
"And health."
"Do excise taxes really discourage smoking and drinking?"
"No!"
"Because the high level of personally imported and smuggled cigarettes and alcohol means that the actual cost of smoking and drinking is cheaper."
"Excise is not only hateful, it is also pointless, and high rates of excise tax which are out of line with those in other countries are even more pointless."
"All they do is distort shopping patterns absurdly and provide fertile ground for organised crime to flourish."
"You, Mr Commissioner, are responsible for ensuring that the single European market functions properly, with free movement of goods and people; and clearly it does not function where there are large disparities in rates of excise duty."
"I, we, accept the concept of tax competition."
"Competition exists in income and corporate taxes, and rightly so."
"Why not also with excise?"
"Perhaps it is time to abandon excise tax altogether and turn to value added tax as the only consumption tax."
"I agree that the amendments should include proposals to facilitate the movement of goods subject to excise duty, with a view to completing the internal market."
"I also support the fact that they place the burden of proof firmly on state authorities."
"I also consider it to be a step forward, that the present draft European Parliament resolution includes the quantitative guide levels for cross-border movements of goods subject to excise duty."
"The Union is not only deepening, however, it is also expanding."
"This means that differences in income and prices among the Member States will increase considerably for quite some time."
"On the EU’s eastern borders in particular, for example in Hungary’s neighbour Romania, it will be a long time before prices and incomes can jump to the level of those in higher-income neighbouring countries."
"Or, if they go ahead and raise them anyway, by means of administratively-set pricing and determining excise duty, then the share of illegal goods in circulation will be considerable."
"The obvious and catastrophic consequence of this would be movements of goods that are in fact intended for commercial purposes, but are declared as goods for private use when crossing national borders."
"The outcome of this would be the organised movement of goods under the carelessly applied slogan of internal market deepening."
"In Hungary, for example, not only would this mean a loss of government excise revenue; it would also harm the retail trade and producers of goods subject to excise duty in general."
"My second comment relating to the report is, that it is difficult to square competition and the reduction of indirect taxation with the goal of increasing the role of indirect modes of taxation vis-à-vis direct taxation in the interests of enhancing our competitiveness."
"In my opinion, one of the lessons to be learned from the shock of last week’s referenda is that EU enlargement not only has long-term, beautiful, ideal effects; it also has immediate consequences for the real economy that can even be negative in the short term."
"It is unfair that our immediate neighbours should be made to bear these negative consequences alone, under the pretext of the omnipotence of the internal market."
"In cases where there are significant income and price differences, a transitional period should certainly be allowed, during which – even beyond 2009 as stipulated in the Accession Treaties in cases of proven necessity – more prosperous neighbouring countries can protect their internal market by keeping administratively set thresholds in place and continuing to monitor these thresholds."
". Mr President, I should like to make some comments on the amendments tabled."
"A number of the amendments modify or add recitals in order to emphasise the need to create an internal market for excise products also."
"I can assure you that is the very purpose of the Commission proposal."
"I feel that is already properly reflected in the recitals."
"As to the amendment requesting that the Commission review and assess the ‘indicative limits’, I can only say that the Commission has assessed them in its report."
"That was the basis for its proposal and it has come to the conclusion that they should no longer appear in EU legislation."
"For this reason, and as the amendment proposed does not reinsert such indicative limits in the directive either, I do not see the need for the Commission to table another report on this issue."
"Lastly, as regards the burden of proof that goods are for private use, the amendment in question seems to place that burden entirely on the administration."
"The Commission approach on this is somewhat different and would seem to be more neutral."
"It is for the citizen to provide any explanation or proof concerning the purpose of his transporting the goods in question."
"It is for the administration to decide on the basis of those elements."
"As such a decision can always be contested, it should be based on firm grounds."
"Mr President, I believe that this debate does no more and no less than to highlight the many things that still remain to be done if we are to see a real internal market in every area of our lives."
"On the one hand, we need to liberalise, simplify, harmonise or develop minimum standards; on the other, there is of course the need for built-in safeguards, particularly where health is concerned."
"We are engaged in progressively implementing both."
"I say ‘yes’ to the internal market, and every effort made towards strengthening it is in the interests of growth and employment and benefits the consumer."
"The second point is one that came across clearly in the debate: this is not a codecision procedure."
"On every issue, this House must be consulted via the codecision procedure, and that includes issues of fiscal policy, and if we want to realise the internal market, we will have to give more attention to tax policy within the European Union."
"I am in favour of tax competition, but every competition has its limits."
"Even though excessively wide bands can result in gross distortions of competition, there is a need for action in tax policy too."
"Thirdly, and in my capacity as chairman of the ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ intergroup, I welcome the greater clarity that this proposal affords the public, not to mention – although the Commissioner did so – the simplified procedures that make for greater clarity and make matters easier for SMEs, and hence also for traders."
"Renewed efforts, though, are needed for we do not yet have an internal market, and so we have not yet heard the last of this proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"The next item is the report by John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on patient mobility and healthcare developments in the European Union (2004/2148(INI)) (A6-0129/2005)."
". Mr President, it has been a delight to listen to ‘Commissioner’ Karas!"
"I am sure it is only a matter of time before we see him in that role."
"Often colleagues are faced with the question on the doorstep of ‘what does Europe do for me?’."
"This debate will help them to answer that question, at least in one respect: that this report and this measure are all about giving patients more rights and power over their own health and the right to go to another Member State for treatment if they face undue delay in their own country."
"That gives great opportunities for patients; it also brings new headaches for the managers of health budgets."
"I should like to thank my colleagues who have contributed to the debates we have had on this issue, not least in a hearing that we held in Parliament."
"I should also like to thank the Commission."
"I sympathise with the Commissioner who tonight is not too well, but I am sure that this measure will help to find a solution even to that and we will be able to find somewhere for him to travel to in order to find succour!"
"I thank him and his staff for the help they have given as we have discussed this issue."
"I thank the many people outside Parliament and the Commission who have given their ideas, as we have sought them, on how we should proceed."
"This measure starts from people."
"It does not start from the Commission, Parliament or governments."
"It starts from people who look to Europe for a solution to their problem."
"They took the issue to the European Court of Justice."
"They challenged that court to give them mobility rights and the court did so."
"It gave them the right, if they faced undue delay in their own country, to go to another country with certain criteria: that the cost was comparable to what they would have paid in their own country and that the treatment was common in their own country."
"There were one or two other criteria as well."
"However, the judgment was made."
"A new opportunity had arisen."
"There are many ways in which people who face delays in their own country can be helped."
"Part of the solution has been the bilateral contracts that we have had between governments and health services."
"Part of it has been the Interreg system bringing together hospitals across the European Union."
"I have seen this here in Strasbourg, which, as a city, is working with Lille and Luxembourg."
"We have the E-111 and the new Euro-health card behind us."
"However, the E-112 has not been part of the solution."
"That form that was supposed to give people the opportunity to go for planned treatment abroad."
"That has been bureaucratic and obstructive and has to be changed."
"We had the high-level reflection group, which looked at the issues, came up with some recommendations, but has gone for the long grass in terms of some of the issues."
"We now need action, we need guidelines."
"The patient who wants to use this opportunity needs to know whether his condition qualifies; he needs to know what forms to fill in; he needs to know where he can go; to which doctors and how he can check up on those doctors; if they are OK; can I get help with travel; can my family come and support me, particularly if there is a child involved; and what happens if something goes wrong."
"Guidance for patients is fundamental and guidance is urgently needed."
"Just as fundamental is guidance to doctors who will refer patients abroad, as is guidance to the health services and the insurance companies who will have unplanned expenditure and want to know how they will be reimbursed."
"There are many issues that we need to look at: information to patients, the transfer of information on patients between countries, checks on doctors, the disciplinary procedures, the complaints procedures that will need to be behind all this, what happens to people who retire abroad to the sun, etc."
"Now we need certainty. If we do nothing then the courts will go deciding."
"The Watts case will be next."
"But I believe that Parliaments, not lawyers, should decide policy."
"I should like to conclude by sharing with you the words of Louis Pasteur, that I quoted in my explanatory statement: (Science recognises no borders because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world.)"
"Let those words be our guide as we give clarity and confidence to our citizens who urgently need both from us."
". Mr President, Mr Bowis is correct in that I have a bit of a nasty stomach problem today."
"He is right: I am a mobile patient myself."
"I am very interested in following the debate."
"I wanted to be here personally because I consider this to be a very important issue, something that we all have to work on in the next few years."
"The rapporteur is right that people are ahead of us in this respect."
"Even though I am not feeling well today, I cannot think of a better place to be, with so many doctors around this evening for this discussion!"
"I feel confident enough in that respect."
"I will listen very carefully to the debate and the comments that will be made by the honourable Members."
"I am very happy that, based on the report, we are thinking along the same lines."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work on, and the effort he has put into, this report."
"I welcome it and the support it offers to the Commission for the work that we are trying to do on this issue."
"There are some issues that we need to take further."
"Judging by what we have included in our proposal for the new health programme, the terms of reference and the work done by the high-level group on health show that this is along the same lines as the proposal of the report."
"The target has to be that a citizen can get the highest level of healthcare in his or her own country."
"That should be the rule."
"Nevertheless, things change."
"People such as myself travel because of business or because they have to wait a long time in their own country or because the specific treatment required is not offered in their country, or even more so, because they feel that they can get better care elsewhere."
"That is a reality and something that we have to deal with."
"It is not always possible, and that is why there is a need for legal certainty."
"That is the very first requirement, with which I agree."
"However, the reality is that people travel and we have to travel for health."
"I heard about an interesting report today, which says that the Polish medical healthcare system has started receiving patients from Germany and the UK."
"That is welcome in the sense that it will boost the budget of the healthcare system in Poland, provided that it is not at the cost of Polish patients."
"That is very important."
"We will work on final solutions: we take on board that message from the report, but this must always be done in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity and the principle that healthcare services are in the competence of Member States."
"Four important points in the report are: the centres of reference; professional mobility, which already causes problems in some of the new Member States because of doctors or healthcare workers moving to other Member States for higher pay; patient safety; and dealing with inequalities."
"We all have to work in that direction, both within the high-level group and the Commission itself."
". Mr President, the question facing us is how we are going to manage the rights of our EU patients to go to another Member State for medical treatment and have their costs reimbursed now that our courts have handed down these rights to them in the context of our single market."
"I thank Mr Bowis for his excellent report."
"We expected nothing less from him."
"This is a first step on that road and is a response to the impressive communication from the High Level Reflection Group, which was set up in response to the ECJ judgments."
"However, I agree with our rapporteur’s view that a sense of urgency is missing from the communication in relation to policy and spending priorities."
"We are also at risk of being driven by the courts rather than the statute in this most important of areas."
"I would favour the minimum legal framework necessary for both providers and purchasers of cross-border healthcare, but we should not underestimate the complexity of the task."
"As we know, health policy and health budgets are competences of the individual Member States: this is strictly subsidiarity."
"So the financial implications of these new patient rights need structuring, not least at the level of health insurance cover, which varies greatly throughout the 25 Member States from demand control to supply control systems."
"The attempt to deal with this issue in the General Services Directive is ill-advised and I welcome the Commission’s change of mind."
"That directive is about service mobility in the EU, not customer or patient mobility."
"It is particularly not about customers who will not be paying their own bills, customers who may need aftercare and follow-up treatments when they return home."
"Our public likes the option of travelling to another EU country if treatment is not available at home: the obvious first choice."
"Treatment may not be available for certain specialities, or there could be an unacceptable delay in accessing the required treatment."
"Large-scale patient mobility should be unnecessary if a Member State discharges its responsibilities with a well-run, efficient health service."
"In 2002 Ireland was forced to set up the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce its ever-lengthening waiting list."
"In that year alone, almost 2 000 Irish patients were sent to the UK for treatment."
"We are adept at exporting our patients."
"Another 650 opted to go to Member States on E112 forms that same year – difficult as those forms are."
"But only one patient opted to travel to Ireland for elective treatment."
"By comparison, 137 000 opted to travel to Spain."
"These figures highlight the urgent need to manage this right to access treatment throughout the EU."
"Our patients, doctors and taxpayers deserve to have it managed properly."
"They want and expect to be offered sound guidance on policy and procedure."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what the next move will be and when."
"Does he accept that a properly structured service is urgently needed in this area?"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, of course, would like to thank Mr Bowis for his splendid report, which will enable us to counter, yet again, the widespread prejudice according to which Europe does not care about its citizens’ actual worries and needs."
"While the public, without a doubt, fear unemployment, they also worry about not always getting the best possible treatment when ill and away from home."
"Anywhere in Europe, anyone can have an accident, become ill and need medical help and treatment, and so it cannot be acceptable that only two thirds of Member States should have their own legislation on the protection of patients in place."
"In my own country, for example, 90% of what patients are entitled to is founded upon widely-dispersed case law, none of which is summarised in a single, comprehensive and binding document."
"It is past high time for current patients’ rights and minimum standards to be brought into line across the EU."
"Everyone – irrespective of whether it is in Spain, Latvia or Poland that they fall ill – must have the same rights as they do in France, Finland or the Czech Republic, for example the right to expert advice that they can understand, the right to documentation relating to treatment and the right to see their patient records."
"What we also need, though, is greater transparency in the reimbursement of costs."
"Even though the ECJ has shed light on which of the costs incurred abroad are reimbursed, Regulation 1408/71 is still unequally applied."
"The existing legislation on reimbursement of costs needs to be approximated, and there is an urgent need for a single legal framework on patient mobility."
"The Internet health portal announced by the Commission also needs to be put in place as soon as possible to carry all the important information that is needed not only by patients and their families, but also by professionals – including such things as data on the fields in which hospitals and doctors specialise, as well as data enabling doctors’ performances to be evaluated and data on patient safety."
"One might say that what we need is a Europe-wide ranking of the kind that exists here and there at national level."
"If people are to make sound decisions on where and how they want to be treated, they have to be well informed, and one in every four Europeans already uses the Internet as a source of health information."
"Let me conclude by pointing out that we must not limit Centres of Reference to the treatment of rare illnesses; they are also needed to deal with all the other conditions that require a particular combination of resources and expertise, such as cancer, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis."
"In a Europe in which patients are mobile, there will be a need for more legal certainty, transparency and even greater quality."
"Subsidiarity notwithstanding, this gives us our great opportunity to enable Europe itself to do much, much more for its citizens."
"Let us follow where Mr Bowis’ report leads in working towards this end."
"Mr President, thank you. Health is of course very important to everyone and is essential to our quality of life."
"This excellent report by Mr Bowis – and I have to say that the original report, that is to say the one before it was approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, was actually far better than what is before us now – is in any case a step in the right direction in promoting public health."
"The report contains a lot of sensible ideas, and I dare say that it is perhaps left up to others, including myself, to say the injudicious things, because the language in the report could have been more forceful, of course."
"The version after it passed the Committee contains many ‘would it not be nice if’ and ‘this and that would need to be promoted’ and the conclusion is yet again that the responsibility for health and health care really lies with the Member States. I already knew that."
"That is how it is provided for in the Treaty, but the question is, of course, whether that is tenable in the long term."
"How do we really help sick people, for example in the case of long waiting lists in my own country or the lack of specialist knowledge?"
"I should therefore like to seize the opportunity of arguing in favour of the European Union adopting a bigger role in health and health care."
"If somebody is ill, they should be given the possibility of receiving medical care abroad."
"Keeping the borders closed for medical care for all kinds of administrative, procedural or financial reasons is ultimately not in the interest of the consumer, and that is what we are here for, after all."
"The right to see a doctor abroad has already been recognised by the Court of Justice, and, as Mr Bowis rightly suggests, why not enshrine it in European legislation?"
"We live in a modern society peopled by well-educated, mobile and responsible citizens, and they should be able to decide where they want to be treated and how."
"Opening up borders for patients also encourages health care in our own countries to achieve better quality, cutting waiting lists and making specialist knowledge available."
"Having said that, I should like to underline the EU’s positive role in health care, and the presence of the Commission at this ungodly hour is appreciated all the more."
"This health care in the European Union is an exception to the rule that the European Union is often associated with the negative image of bureaucracy and drafting senseless and unnecessary rules."
"We do good work here, and it goes without saying that we will be voting for Mr Bowis’ report with great enthusiasm."
". Mr President, I would like to thank John Bowis for an excellent report."
"I only regret that my main committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did not get its act together to draw up an opinion on this subject."
"As the committee responsible for Regulation (EC) No 1408/71, we have an interest in it, as do I as Parliament’s rapporteur during the previous term."
"I am rather concerned about the tone of some of the comments that I have just been hearing."
"Let us be clear: patients have the right to move under certain circumstances."
"It is not a free-for-all, and I do not think Parliament should be giving that impression."
"Not least because some colleagues who sit in Member State parliaments would be a little upset to see us moving their budgets as a matter of course because we choose to."
"It is right that we need greater clarity around the rules on this, but I welcome the recognition in this report that healthcare is a service to people in need, it is not an ordinary consumer product."
"Therefore, it should not be in the services directive."
"That is not the appropriate place either to deal with questions of reimbursement."
"We will have a real mess unless we do this properly and in a considered manner, as has been proposed in this report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, it would be an oversight on my part if I too failed in turn to congratulate Mr Bowis who, through his report, has expressed his knowledge and experience on these matters."
"The opinion of the European Parliament on the serious issue of patient mobility is important as a lever for exerting pressure on the European Commission to take clearer measures on this issue."
"European patients have rights which must also be protected by law, so that they can have the corresponding social cover wherever they may be in the Europe of free movement."
"It is important, I believe, to promote simple, daily information for patients as regards their rights and to recognise the peculiarities of groups of patients such as the elderly, the illiterate and pensioners, as Amendment 37 also emphasises."
"In addition, the protection of patients' personal data is important."
"Provision is made for the creation of a database of medical information on patients; however, as provided for in Amendments 48, 49, 50, 67 and 68, certain protective measures must be taken to prevent abuse."
"I also consider it necessary to clarify the situation in cross-border areas."
"In other words, patients must be treated in hospitals as close to their place of residence as possible."
"Numerous European countries which border each other, such as France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, have developed close cooperation mechanisms, mechanisms which start with road transport and extend to health issues."
"It is only natural that certain citizens resident in cross-border areas should be able to go for treatment to hospitals in neighbouring countries which are closer to home than treatment centres in their own country."
"I call on you, therefore, to support Amendment 41, paragraph 8."
"Finally, I should like to stress that health services cannot be compared with goods offered for sale."
"I therefore consider that the question of patient mobility and of services in general should not be included in a general services directive."
"Nonetheless, we do need a proposal for action on mobility, with a specific timetable, which takes account of the conclusions of the High Level Group on Health Services and Medical Care."
". The protection of public health is a priority goal for any state and for any public health service."
"Cooperation in this field, particularly at Member State level, should in theory increase the treatment options available, not only by making it possible to receive treatment after having moved to another EU Member State, but also by allowing patients to travel to other facilities if appropriate medical care is unavailable in their home country."
"The problem of mobility poses a multitude of risks, however."
"These are primarily due to the economic and political differences that exist between the old and rich EU Member States and the new Member States, whose development has been held back until today as a result of the Soviet totalitarian rule to which they were previously subjected."
"Whereas citizens of the 15 old Member States mainly move around the EU in order to avoid waiting lists or in search of cheaper treatment, the majority of citizens in the new Member States are denied medical care."
"The main reason for this is the mass exodus of skilled workers, or in other words highly-educated doctors and nurses, to rich countries."
"Mr Bowis was right to highlight this ‘brain drain’ in his report, as it poses an enormous threat to the health of less wealthy citizens."
"What is more, the various liberal ideas that are currently in vogue, which include viewing health care as a service and a market commodity and making it more difficult to acquire specialist qualifications, as well as the various economic programmes that advocate job cuts at the expense of health-care systems and that merely improve the economic situation of private medical centres, will not solve the growing number of problems we face in the health-care sector or create new jobs."
"The end result of this will be an increase in the cost of medical care and a deterioration of public health."
"I welcome Mr Bovis's report on patient mobility and healthcare developments in the European Union."
"I support the Commission's action plan for healthcare in Europe, which would genuinely guarantee people's safe freedom of movement."
"Particularly at a time when Europe is much troubled by the question of 'European solidarity versus national identity', it is important to demonstrate to citizens that the European institutions are preparing simplified mechanisms and improved healthcare for their citizens."
"The fact that, on the basis of the principle of Subsidiarity, Member States and their politicians are responsible for providing healthcare is one of the serious obstacles to the free movement of people."
"Patients face no waiting list when it comes to paying for health insurance, which they do loyally, promptly and regularly, yet when they urgently need a service in return for their money, healthcare is denied them or delayed."
"Patient mobility could help to improve the currently inadequate healthcare in some Member States."
"Effectively, waiting lists cause patient's treatment to be postponed, something that may even, from a medical point of view, might be seen as a threat to their health and their lives."
"Waiting lists can be for plastic surgery."
"Patients having to wait for, say, a hip replacement, are ruining their health in the meantime with painkillers, long-term use of which can cause dependence, bone marrow decay and stomach ulcers."
"Furthermore, some Member States are at present remedying their healthcare deficiencies to their advantage;"
"I use the word 'advantage' to refer to purchasing the services of cheap labour in the form of doctors and nurses from Eastern Europe."
"As far as Europe's future is concerned, I therefore consider patient mobility to be far preferable to health worker mobility."
"When doctors and nurses leave Eastern European States, healthcare suffers there."
"According to Slovak Medical Association statistics, more doctors left Slovakia than graduated from the country's three medical faculties."
"It is therefore clear that, in the future, gaps will appear on the map of Europe, a state of affairs that, again, is no solution."
"Mr President, thank you. First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the clarity of his report and of his stance on something that is a live issue."
"It is an unfortunate fact that health care is far from ideal in many countries."
"What is worse, in many countries, questions are being asked about quality and accessibility at a time when waiting lists and waiting times are getting longer."
"Under normal circumstances, patients benefit from care close to home, in their own countries at any rate."
"In the situation of reduced quality, it becomes appealing for patients to look across the border."
"Recent court judgments have encouraged patients to look elsewhere for an answer to their health problems."
"I totally agree with the rapporteur’s giving first place to the improvement of quality in health care; shopping across the border does not solve anything."
"It is, of course, practical to make joint arrangements about transnational treatments in border regions, and the departure of patients to other countries can be an incentive to invest more in national health care, although that is an unwieldy way of stimulating quality."
"It is therefore unacceptable for patient mobility to be regulated in the Services Directive by way of afterthought, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to delete patient mobility from that directive."
"We are faced, however, with an urgent problem."
"There is a considerable difference in quality between the Member States."
"The varying chances of survival for, for example, bladder cancer are shocking."
"In Austria and Iceland, the chance of surviving bladder cancer is twice that in Poland."
"Instead of dreaming up procedures, laws and regulations which should guide the free movement of patients, the Commission would be wiser to invest in the exchange of knowledge in the most dynamic way possible."
"Patients with bladder cancer in Poland deserve high-quality treatment too."
"All bladder cancer patients want to benefit from Austrian knowledge and expertise."
"Let us therefore take this step forward and not invest unnecessarily in mobility that patients do not want anyway."
"Nobody enjoys waking up from a general anaesthetic in a strange environment."
"I would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility."
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to thank Mr Bowis for this excellent report."
"Around Europe, there are many patients and people who are in need of care who have a lot to gain from the vision we are presenting in this House of increased opportunities to move across borders."
"There are, unfortunately, politicians and bureaucrats in Europe who frown upon increased mobility and freedom of choice."
"They regard freedom of choice as a threat to their own ability to plan and regulate, in other words as a threat to their own power."
"That is why, in so many Member States including Sweden, it may be impossible for patients even to seek care in another part of the country."
"With this report, we clearly show that we are not on the side of the bureaucrats in this conflict, but on that of the patients."
"I wish, however, to emphasise that I too think that health care is a national matter."
"Our task is to tear down borders and ensure that patients can seek care wherever they need to."
"Freedom of movement provides, firstly, competition between health care systems that drives development forward and, secondly, a more efficient use of health services’ scarce resources."
"In Sweden, patients may need to queue up for years, waiting for treatment for which there is overcapacity in other countries."
"By tearing down the borders, we create the preconditions for both development and efficiency."
"This means an improvement in healthcare in our Member States, with more people’s needs being met."
"I would call upon my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment 5, tabled by Mr Bowis, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and myself on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"The amendment entails adding a new paragraph, 4a, about not stating in the resolution that we are to remove health services and medical care from the Services Directive."
"If there are any service companies operating in an environment characterised by regulations and monopolies that prevent mobility and competition, it is specifically companies providing medical treatment and healthcare."
"To crown it all, the removal of healthcare services from the directive is not a subject that even belongs within this debate, in which we are discussing the mobility of patients, not that of healthcare providers."
"It is important to emphasise people’s knowledge of healthcare in different countries."
"We need informed patients who are able to benefit from the opportunities we are opening up to them."
"I therefore want to conclude by inviting you all to a seminar on 15 June in Brussels where we shall, for the first time, present a proper factual comparison from the patient’s perspective of Europe’s healthcare systems."
"You are all sincerely welcome to attend."
"– Mr President, we must today, I believe, make it abundantly clear to the European public that, while every jot and tittle of Mr Bowis’ excellent report cries out for Europe to take an initiative, this cannot justify the charge of over-regulation that is levelled against it."
"If implemented, every single thing that the report demands and proposes would add value to the European citizen’s participation in the European Union."
"Let me say, then, that, second only to growth and employment policy, it is social and health policy to which demographic change presents the greatest challenge of all, not only in view of the ballooning costs in that area, but also in terms of the realisation of our four freedoms, of the expanding internal market and of the public’s greater mobility."
"European citizenship is something that we all want."
"Europe’s citizens have fundamental rights; medical care and help in an emergency are, within the European Union, among them, and they cannot be restricted to a citizen’s own country."
"As a community founded upon solidarity, we have to be there for each other, above all when we need each other."
"That is why I am very much in favour of the suggestions that there should be a Commission proposal specifically dealing with the issue of patient mobility."
"I am very keen that patient mobility should not be subject to the Services Directive, and social and health services should be treated separately rather than now being thrown in the same pot as the Services Directive."
"This is not solely about them as a commodity, but also about quality and clear definitions, about a legal framework and the clarification of who pays and who gets what."
"My view is that the report has come at the right time, for these are issues that we are currently discussing at so many different levels."
"We should take the report as the starting point for a wide-ranging debate on health and social provision and for a debate on how to achieve a better balance of national competence in relation to European responsibility."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this very interesting debate."
"It was also very useful for me to see how we can take this work further."
"Let me begin by reassuring Mrs Doyle that I share her concern about the urgency of this whole issue."
"I am really concerned about every single aspect of this complex issue which we call patient mobility, because it is not just about moving patients from one country to another."
"Members have mentioned the problems with professional mobility and the burden on healthcare systems."
"But we cannot do everything at once."
"One complication is that most of this lies within the competence of the Member States."
"The processes in the Union are rather slower than in the Member States, but when it comes to coordination or whatever method we choose, it takes even longer."
"Nevertheless, I shall tell you what I plan to do in the near future."
"Everything has to be done, but it is a matter of choosing priorities."
"Some things are easier or more urgent."
"The first one you have all mentioned: legal certainty."
"This has to be dealt with."
"I will not take a position on the Services Directive."
"I am waiting for the conclusion of the discussions."
"I can assure you that if eventually it is decided not to include health in the Services Directive - I am speaking hypothetically here - we will bring forward a different proposal."
"As soon as you decide what to do with the Services Directive!"
"It is not final yet, but let me put it like this: no time will be wasted."
"That is the first priority."
"We will have our health portal by the end of the year."
"This is moving forward, as you know, the provision of information about access to healthcare is more an issue for the Member States, but we shall, nevertheless, include it in our health portal."
"I will speed up the progress of the High Level Group, so that they can deal with the various issues they are working on. I shall give priority to a health programme for the gathering of data information, because it seems that this might not be progressing as well as we think, but because of faults in the system we are not receiving the right information."
"So it might be progressing better than we think."
"So I shall give priority to gathering data information."
"Centres of reference are very important and are included in the report."
"In 2006 there will be at least a pilot project."
"However, we also encourage them within Member States, because they is needed there as well."
"Patient safety is important."
"The Luxembourg presidency and the UK presidency are giving it priority."
"I hope that by the end of the UK presidency we will have some more concrete conclusions on that."
"The use of information technology for facilitating payments, records and so on and the use of e-Health information technology have been mentioned."
"Patients’ rights are important."
"I am proud to say that the country I know best has already adopted legislation in this respect."
"It is a question of subsidiarity, but we will encourage the Member States to adopt some kind of charter of patients’ rights, which may or may not be binding depending on the legal system of each Member State."
"Finally, another project which is important and which we will finance through the new health programme – provided it survives the Financial Perspectives debate – will be the financing of a new strand in health cooperation between Member States."
"This will provide vital resources at European level to turn the discussions on cooperation into practical reality, including the other information and the centres of reference mentioned earlier."
"In conclusion, I apologise again for taking so much time, but I wish to thank everybody for this debate."
"I will keep Parliament informed on the progress of the High Level Group."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"Mr President, yesterday you wondered why there were not enough people in the Chamber at the time of the debate."
"This morning we had the same problem and you had to wait until people came."
"It is no wonder there is not good attendance; it is because no debate is taking place."
"All we do in this Chamber is hear predetermined, prepared, one or two minute speeches without actual dialogue; they are just monologues."
"I think the procedure has to change if we are to have dialogue, proper debates and proper attendance."
"Mr Matsakis, that was not a point of order, but rather a statement."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements Preparation of the European Council, including the future of the Union after the referenda on the European Constitution (Brussels, 16-17 June 2005)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that will begin its work on 16 June will have to discuss two issues that will decide the future development of the European Union: the ratification process for the Constitutional Treaty and the conclusion of a political agreement on the financial perspectives."
"Following intense debates, first of all the citizens of France, and then the citizens of the Netherlands, rejected the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, signed in Rome on 29 October 2004."
"There were many reasons for these no votes, some of them contradictory."
"Many of us expressed our disappointment and our regrets at the outcome of those votes."
"But a democratic debate took place and we must, of course, fully respect the democratic choice made by a clear majority of the French and Dutch electorates."
"I cannot help but recall the huge vote that the European Parliament expressed on 12 January 2005 in favour of the draft European Constitution."
"This vote was driven by a great hope; a conviction that the European Union, following enlargement with ten new members, could strengthen its democratic basis, operate more effectively and more transparently, anchor its future in the common values that are so close to our hearts and, in this way, finally regain the full confidence of its citizens."
"Ten countries have ratified the draft Constitution, including one – Spain - by referendum."
"In these cases, too, we must respect their democratic decision."
"Nevertheless, the votes in the Netherlands and France, two of the founding countries, have still created a new situation that we must face up to."
"Via these polls, the people have expressed their worries, their aspirations and expectations, but also their disappointments."
"Unfortunately, European unification no longer seems to be this mobilising project that has enabled us, over decades, to reconstruct our continent in peace and prosperity, before reconciling it by means of enlargement."
"Is hope changing sides?"
"Does Europe now only inspire anxiety, incomprehension?"
"Is it bringing upon itself all of the social unrest that many of our fellow citizens feel, quite rightly, faced with difficulties, faced with long-term unemployment for too long?"
"I do not think so."
"The message sent by many French and Dutch citizens is twofold."
"True, there is dissatisfaction with the form and operation of Europe, but, at the same time, for a large proportion of the citizens who said no, there is still considerable support for the idea of Europe and for the necessity for it, but it is support for a Europe that acts differently in a world that is undergoing a process of transformation."
"The European Council will have to listen to these messages, expressed following a democratic debate that, certainly, has been lacking for too long."
"All those who justified their choice to refuse by referring to a hypothetical Plan B must now realise that there is no easy escape from a situation that has become extremely complex."
"We must note, today, that Declaration 30 nevertheless provides for a situation in which, at the end of the ratification period, several countries have not managed to complete this procedure."
"We must also take into account the fact that ten countries have successfully completed the ratification procedure while more than half of the Member States have not yet expressed their opinion."
"It is not easy to deprive these people, or these parliaments, of a democratic debate and of the opportunity to express their opinion in their turn."
"Let us also remember that the draft Constitution is the result of an overall compromise, that it has its own coherence, and that we cannot easily have one element without another."
"The European Council should therefore carry out an in-depth collective analysis of the situation before defining clearly how the process will continue."
"One thing seems certain: the European Union must not slide into a sort of permanent uncertainty, opposition to change or, even worse, paralysis."
"Our institutions work, and will continue to work. Our decision-making capacity is intact, even if, obviously, the provisions of the Treaty of Nice are inadequate, in view of the political, economic and social challenges that the EU and our Member States must deal with ever more urgently."
"The citizens expect concrete action, better consideration of their concerns, whether in economic and social matters or with regard to their security."
"The world is wondering about the future of the EU, which has for a long time fascinated many peoples on all continents."
"The European Council must therefore broaden its thinking."
"It cannot limit itself to procedural issues, when peoples’ expectations are, above all, political."
"A political EU must remain our aim, and the construction of a true European democracy is still the only way of achieving it."
"In that context, the negotiations on the financial perspectives take on a very particular dimension."
"Failure, an inability to reach a satisfactory compromise, would be, for our own citizens and above all for the outside world, the sign of a dangerous impasse."
"These financial perspectives may not reflect all the ambitions of one party or another, but they will nevertheless enable the EU to take action in the interests of competitiveness, employment, economic and social cohesion, better protection of the environment and internal security and in favour of a more active international role."
"Indeed, if we can adopt them now despite our differences, this will provide the political impetus that the EU now needs more urgently than ever."
"Following the rich debate that you had yesterday, the vote that Parliament will take shortly on the resolution could send a signal of prime importance, a signal of encouragement."
"You can be sure that the Presidency will do everything in its power to facilitate a compromise that is acceptable to all."
"Mr President, in addition to these decisive questions, the European Council will be dealing with other matters that are no less important for the citizens."
"We now need to implement the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy in the interests of growth and employment."
"To this end, in accordance with the new approach adopted in March, the European Council will have to approve the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs 2005-2008."
"That is how, on the basis of the work of all the relevant configurations of the Council, the implementation of macroeconomic and microeconomic policies and employment policies can be based around 24 integrated guidelines."
"By the autumn, the Member States will have translated these guidelines into coherent national programmes promoting growth and employment."
"This must not be a formality, but an enterprise involving all those concerned and, in particular, the parliamentary bodies and the social partners."
"I would also like to mention that, in line with the decision taken in March, the European Council will be invited to approve a declaration on guiding principles for sustainable development."
"This should enable us to adopt a revised sustainable development strategy, if possible before the end of 2005."
"The European Council will also have to look into certain important aspects of the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In this field, we owe it to ourselves to demonstrate that the EU is able to respond effectively to the citizens’ expectations."
"The citizens of Europe expect, quite rightly, that the European Union will adopt a more effective common approach to cross-border problems, such as illegal immigration, people trafficking, the fight against organised crime, the fight against terrorism, which you debated yesterday and which we consider to be very important."
"Last November, we adopted the Hague Programme which, quite rightly, sets the priorities over the next five years for the creation of a true area of freedom, security and justice."
"In this vein, the next European Council will be presented with an action plan translating the objectives of the Hague Programme into concrete measures."
"In that regard, the Presidency would stress that it is crucial for the Member States to implement the various measures included effectively and within the deadlines."
"The European Council will in particular review the efforts made to combat terrorism."
"You have emphasised its urgency, and the need for a comprehensive approach that combines security and freedom."
"The European Council should, in particular, identify certain high-priority areas of action for the coming months: for example, police and judicial cooperation, the ongoing work to prevent the recruitment of terrorists, the fight against terrorist financing or strengthening our civil protection capacities, in particular in order to combat any bioterrorist threat."
"Finally, and I am now coming to the end, Mr President, certain important issues need to be raised with regard to external relations."
"I am referring in particular to the reform of the United Nations, which will be the focus of the United Nations Summit in September."
"We consider it to be essential for this summit to reach a balanced and ambitious result, which will make it possible to reform the UN in order to respond more effectively to the multidimensional threats and challenges identified in the report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"I think we are going to discuss this, particularly this afternoon."
"Among the other international issues, preparations for the International Conference on Iraq, jointly organised by the European Union and the United States, which will take place in Brussels on 22 June, will be up for discussion."
"The aim will be to set up a new framework to coordinate the aid effort in Iraq."
"In this regard, it is appropriate to stress the prime, essential, fundamental role of the Iraqi Government in the period of transition and reconstruction of that country."
"As you can see, from these various subjects, Europe must continue."
"We must show that it has retained its full ability to make decisions and take action."
"I think that the debates you are going to conduct now must be a spur in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council, set to take place on 16 and 17 June, must meet two key challenges for the EU head on. The first of these is to send out a message to our fellow citizens that there is convergence between the Member States regarding the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty, and the second is to provide the Union with a stable financial framework for the next few years."
"Yet whilst these issues are undoubtedly important, we must not overlook other items on the agenda, such as the integrated guidelines for implementing the Lisbon strategy and the sustainable development strategy."
"There is one issue that I should like to bring to the fore: that of development aid in the context of the Millennium Goals."
"Our internal problems must not divert us from our external responsibilities, particularly with regard to developing countries."
"In 2005, which is already considered the year of development, Europe must fulfil its responsibility to support those most in need and must be at the forefront of the fight against poverty and hunger in the world."
"Ahead of the G8 Summit, where Africa will rightly be a priority, and the important United Nations Conference due to take place in September, it is vitally important that the Council confirm the agreement reached by the ministers of the Member States on the basis of a proposal tabled by the Commission and firmly commit itself to honouring the Millennium Goals to support development."
"This is what is expected of a Europe that must continue to show solidarity and be open to the world rather than inward-looking."
"I wanted to make sure that I mentioned this at the beginning of a process in which the European question will naturally be the main focus, but at this difficult time we must not lose sight of the fact that there are others in need of our help."
"Around 25 000 human beings die every die of starvation or thirst."
"Europe must not continue its tacit acceptance of this situation."
"The crucial challenge for our civilisation at this time is to say that enough is enough, and that it is time to put an end to this situation that appals every one of us."
"Mr President, I do not intend to go over the details of yesterday’s debate on the financial perspective."
"The Temporary Committee of Parliament, under your chairmanship, Mr President, achieved a remarkable synthesis."
"I have every confidence that this will be reflected in the vote later today."
"Parliament will then have established a clear vision for the Union and its financing for the coming years."
"Between now and the meeting of the European Council, there will be a series of staging posts which, we hope, will lead us to a Council position to match that of Parliament and then to the adoption of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Of course, the current political context has raised questions about the likelihood of agreement on the financial perspective."
"I should first of all make it clear that I am in full agreement with the Council presidency that an agreement at European Council level is not only desirable, but also possible."
"We shall do everything to achieve that."
"When faced with political problems, the worst reaction would be to do nothing and remain paralysed."
"Rather, we should show that the Union remains a dynamic political force, strong enough to continue its work in the face of difficulties."
"I believe that, at a time when some would expect the Union to be in disarray, an agreement on the financial perspective would show its determination to overcome problems and help generate renewed political impetus."
"With regard to substance, I should like to reiterate that we need to retain the overall rationale and balance of the Commission’s initial proposals."
"However, this is a negotiation."
"We recognise that means changes to the proposals and that those changes are inevitable."
"There is always a risk that, in order to reach agreement, we may be tempted to go down the road of undermining policy coherence in order to satisfy particular interests."
"I would hope that we can resist, or at least minimise, that temptation."
"The Commission’s proposals were a careful balance between tried and tested policies and the Union’s new policy proposals."
"We would be doing the Union a disservice if we undermined that balance."
"The Union’s budget exists to deliver common, set political objectives."
"At the European Council we will doubtless have detailed and sometimes difficult negotiations, but if we can keep in mind that we are talking about what the Union really has to do, it is possible to reach an agreement that will allow the Union to go forward effectively."
"I would like the Commission and Parliament to remain in close contact in the run-up to and during the last stage of negotiations so that together we can contribute to the best possible deal for the Union."
"The Luxembourg presidency has led discussions into their final phase."
"It has proposed a new ‘negotiating box’."
"Next Sunday we will have the final ministerial conclave; on the eve of the summit we will have the trialogue between the institutions."
"We must commend the presidency for its great efforts and determination in finding a deal."
"It is true that the proposal now on the table is closer to the minimalist approach favoured by some Member States than to the position of Parliament."
"As I indicated yesterday, I hope that the presidency will carefully consider the very balanced views expressed by Parliament and take due account of them in the final round of negotiations."
"I hope an agreement will be reached that shows that Europe is maintaining its ambition and solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands are, for the European Commission – and also, I am sure, for the majority of Parliament – a source of concern, given that those results risk weakening the EU and that those two countries have always been important players in our common project."
"Throughout its history, the EU has experienced many difficulties, but the commitment and conviction of its leaders have enabled us to overcome them and to relaunch the European project."
"Perhaps you will allow me, Mr President, to share with Parliament certain thoughts brought to mind by the parallels between the current situation and the one we experienced 50 years ago, when the project of the European Defence Community failed and the European leaders, instead of bringing an end to their ambitions for Europe, found the best way of overcoming this problem."
"We must now honestly try to understand why two countries as important as France and the Netherlands voted no."
"It is very important that these concerns were expressed in a democratic vote following a very lively debate."
"For a democrat, that is a positive element in itself."
"We must all respect the expression of the citizens’ will, but we must honestly recognise that this debate was often mixed up with national issues and that, sometimes, the arguments exchanged had little to do with the European Constitution."
"Besides certain purely national considerations, the fact is that popular votes have become opportunities to express fears, which we must take seriously, in particular the citizens’ fears faced with the European social model, with decolonisation, with the fact that Europe is moving too fast and expanding too far or is even sometimes connected with the threat of globalisation."
"Even if we admit that the referendum debates were to a certain extent contaminated by other subjects, we must recognise in all honesty that this vote is an expression of dissatisfaction with the EU and with the European project in those two countries."
"That is why, at Berlaymont, the Presidents of the European Parliament and of the European Council and I emphasised, in our joint declaration following the French referendum, that the relevant national and European politicians must do more to explain the true scale of what is at stake, and the nature of the answers that only Europe can offer, and that we must ask ourselves how each among us can contribute to a better understanding of this project, which cannot have its own legitimacy without listening to its citizens."
"The content of the debates and the results of the two referenda thus force us to seriously consider our ability – both that of the European institutions and that of the national institutions and authorities – to mobilise the support and commitment of Europeans."
"We must reconnect the EU with the citizens and the citizens with the EU."
"This is absolutely imperative, and I will have the opportunity to return to this subject in the coming weeks."
"Today, though, the most urgent question that we must answer in the face of a situation that could put the brakes on European integration is this: how can we bring about a new political consensus and take advantage of this difficult moment to relaunch Europe?"
"This is a political difficulty, and we must resolve it politically."
"We must not avoid looking reality in the face."
"I would like, straight away, to emphasise that ratification is above all a matter for the Member States."
"Twenty-five governments signed the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is up to them to decide when and how to ratify it and whether they want to honour the commitment they made or withdraw from it."
"Ten Member States have so far ratified the Constitution, including one, namely Spain, in a very clear referendum."
"In two other Member States, the referenda came out negatively."
"However, other Member States have not yet expressed their position and I think that all the Member States of the EU have the right to express their position on equal terms."
"Nevertheless, the essential thing now, in my view, is for the Member States to respond together to the current situation and for us to avoid unilateral, individual, disparate actions."
"That is why I asked them to wait for next week’s European Council to adopt a position."
"I note that the governments have largely demonstrated restraint and, where it was considered unavoidable to adopt a position for internal reasons, they have retained a sense of moderation and the possibility of a debate and of a collective decision."
"The fate of the Constitution is now in the hands of the Member States."
"It is important for the Heads of State or Government to analyse the current situation and to send a clear message to all Europeans."
"I am convinced that it is possible and desirable for this message to translate the desire to reach a new political consensus in Europe."
"Analysis of the current situation shows that there are two possible – and I would stress, possible – extreme solutions that, in my opinion, must be avoided at all costs."
"The first inappropriate solution would be to say that nothing has happened, that everything can continue – business as usual – as if these two negative votes in such important countries had never happened."
"In my opinion, this would demonstrate an attitude that is self-absorbed, irresponsible, arrogant and disrespectful of the will expressed by a majority of the citizens of two countries that we have a duty to listen to."
"Another inappropriate extreme solution would be to abandon the draft Constitutional Treaty straight away."
"This would involve ignoring the fact that ten Member States have already ratified it and that the no votes in two States, although they express a negative position with regard to the Constitution, nonetheless do not constitute support for an alternative project and also include some contradictions."
"Therefore, if we are going to avoid these two extreme solutions, we must look for another solution."
"And I think that we must now start to create the conditions that will allow a solution to be found that results in the emergence of a new political consensus, because – I say again – it is in political terms that we must find a solution."
"There is no administrative, bureaucratic or technocratic solution."
"We must have a political debate in Europe in order to reach a political solution for the future of our Europe."
"Without calling the draft Constitutional Treaty into question, we must move Europe on and avoid paralysis."
"This solution can only result from an in-depth analysis and from an open debate."
"It must necessarily be drawn up in a spirit of compromise between the 25 Member States within the European Council, also with the full participation of the European Commission and having listened carefully to the European Parliament, and also to the national parliaments and our societies."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, as we have always said, there is no plan B. It does not exist."
"It has never existed."
"But could we perhaps talk about a plan D?"
"D for democracy and dialogue."
"A plan D to listen to the people; a plan through which the European and national institutions devote themselves to an exercise of listening to and debating with the citizens and civil society, in order to deepen our analysis of a complex situation."
"This should enable us to take a more consensual path, particularly because it is more representative of the will of all our citizens."
"In view of the scepticism expressed by some of our fellow citizens, we must show that the European Union can, now more than ever, respond to their concerns and to the many challenges of the new millennium."
"Admittedly, the results of the two referenda last week constitute a serious problem, but it is not the first time that Europe has encountered problems and it will certainly not be the last."
"Europe is necessary, now more than ever."
"That is why the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to take important decisions that will bring real benefits to all the citizens of Europe, because the political life of the EU is continuing, even after the referenda."
"We have strategic objectives to implement, which have also been supported by the European Parliament and by the European Council."
"They respond to the citizens’ concerns, as they focus on prosperity, solidarity and security."
"All the European institutions must now particularly show a spirit of compromise and unite around the aspiration to move forward and to achieve our aims, in particular by combating unemployment and insecurity."
"In the coming days and weeks, we will have to join together to manage a complex situation."
"In this context, I think we must avoid two dangerous pitfalls: the first I would call the blame game, and the second pitfall I would describe as the deepening of negative ideological splits."
"First of all, we must at all costs avoid succumbing to the blame game, in other words making pointless and dangerous accusations that aim in particular to make the European institutions – be it the Commission, the European Parliament or the Council – scapegoats for the difficulties encountered, either at national level or in the face of global challenges."
"Of course, the European institutions are not perfect."
"Who could claim to be!"
"It is because we have recognised that there were certain problems that my Commission, since it entered office six months ago, has decided to draw up initiatives to achieve better communication and to improve the quality of legislation, by avoiding pointless legislation and pointless bureaucracy."
"That is why we have launched the initiative ‘Better regulation’."
"We have also started to consider the transparency with which the institutions operate."
"We recognise, indeed, that we could all improve the relationship of confidence and responsibility between the citizens and the EU, in particular by adhering more closely to the subsidiarity principle that everybody talks about but that is often not applied."
"Take care, though, ladies and gentlemen: the temptation to attribute unpopular decisions to Brussels - what we are accustomed to refer to as Brussels - has already, in the past, caused immense damage, and it continues."
"We must resist this temptation."
"Meetings between the representatives of the Member States must not be described as battlefields with victors and losers."
"Europe is created in compromise and by compromise, and it is above all the responsibility of the representatives of the Member States to explain that and to argue in favour of Europe instead of exploiting national egotism in a way that is negative to our Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us be frank: if we attack Brussels six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, can we hope that the citizens will support Europe on Sunday?"
"It is difficult, is it not?"
"However, there is a second pitfall."
"This second pitfall consists in now becoming entrenched in ideological splits, even if we admit that there are different concepts of Europe."
"Encouraging division around two monotheistic political ideas, the monotheism of the market and the monotheism of the State, does no service to Europe."
"Neither of the two, neither the god of the market nor the god of the State, will solve Europe’s problems."
"Any attempt to impose on Europe one of the two, a single European idea, is doomed to failure."
"What we now need is an intelligent fusion of the market and the State that can help Europe to be a winner, not a loser, in the face of globalisation."
"We do not have any illusions: Europe, by definition, is diverse, and it is good that it is remaining diverse."
"We have different ideological positions, particularly in the political battle at national level."
"Any attempt to impose on Europe, through the European institutions, a single ideal, a single ideological direction, would mean forgetting that Europe is forged in diversity, in difference, but also, it has to be said, in the search for compromise and consensus."
"That is why I think it is vital to transform this period of crisis into a period favourable to opportunities and to take advantage of it to forge a new political consensus."
"The role of the Commission as I see it is to promote this consensus and to avoid exacerbating pointless and dangerous antagonisms."
"Without this new political consensus, it will be more difficult to reach a compromise and solutions."
"It is in this vein and with this aim that I am launching an appeal to all European leaders, particularly at national level."
"All of us must demonstrate a sense of responsibility and be equal to the very difficult situation with which we are faced."
"Thus, I call on all the national authorities to agree to make a serious effort to resist the national egotism which has done such harm to Europe and which is continuing to damage it seriously."
"I call for unity around European values, around, we could say, the European culture, around our European spirit, so that, together, we can build a new political consensus, both dynamic and constructive, a consensus that will make it possible to avoid Europe becoming the first victim of globalisation, but, on the contrary, will enable Europe to win this battle of globalisation."
"I can assure you that the Commission is fully mobilised and available to contribute to this and that we are quite willing to work with all of you, with the various political groupings, on the condition that you all understand and accept that Europe is not the problem, but rather the solution to the problems the citizens are facing today."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, greatly disappointed though the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been by the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the greatest danger that we now face is that of losing direction."
"That is why we say that the European Union might not be the answer to all of our problems, but without the European Union we will not be able to overcome any of the major challenges facing us, and that is why we say: the objective is still right!"
"France and the Netherlands – two important countries, admittedly – cannot take responsibility for the 25 Members of the European Union."
"Secondly, the ten countries that have ratified the Constitutional Treaty represent 220 million people; these ten ratifications cannot and must not go by the board."
"Thirdly, the 13 countries that have yet to ratify are entitled to express their views on the constitution."
"That is why we recommend a pause for reflection."
"No one has a quick-fix solution today."
"We need to reflect."
"We must be calm and collected."
"In the same way, however, we need to combine being calm and collected with determination, and probably the right solution – although this is for the Heads of State or Government to decide – is to engage in a period of reflection and thought, and to postpone the referenda for a certain amount of time."
"This must all be reflected on."
"There are a whole host of possible reasons for the ‘no’ votes in the Netherlands and France."
"Some of them are identical; some are not."
"The unpopularity of the present leadership, the government, is perhaps a factor."
"Then there is the point that you made, Mr President, a point which also concerns us in the European Parliament: less legislation in Europe is sometimes more for all of us."
"Then the issue of enlargement: it is very significant that people have the impression that everything is moving too quickly."
"We have to take this into account."
"In our group’s view, we need firstly to endeavour – and given the subjects at issue this will lead to more quarrels – to ensure that we concentrate on the essential issues. Europe must be strong where Europe alone can act, and we also need to be more strict about applying the principle of subsidiarity."
"Secondly, we must not overstretch this European Union politically, culturally or geographically."
"That is the major concern that was expressed in the referenda, and it is one that we must take very seriously."
"We say very firmly: But does not apply solely to the European Union, but also to those countries that want to join the European Union."
"It also applies to both Romania and Bulgaria!"
"Mr President of the Commission, I would make this request to you and your staff: when you draft your progress report for Romania and Bulgaria – Parliament has given its assent for both countries, but there will be this progress report – please do not pull your punches in this report, but describe the situation as it really is, openly and honestly."
"That is what we now expect from you."
"Then we will be able to draw conclusions from this progress report."
"As far as Turkey is concerned, we are expecting – the Council still has to decide of course – that Turkey will also meet the conditions set, and introduce the six pieces of legislation concerned."
"They need to be ratified."
"The question of whether Turkey is fit for entry to the European Union is also relevant."
"Cyprus also needs to be unambiguously recognised, for how can you negotiate with a party that you do not even recognise?"
"We need an answer to this too."
"The negotiations will be open-ended."
"But we would ask for this to be the subject of reflection, and I confess that in our group, as in other groups, opinions diverge on this."
"The objective can be membership, but it can also be a privileged partnership."
"We need to have an open and honest conversation about this, so that we do not raise any false expectations."
"I wish you, Mr President-in-Office, and the Commission – and I was delighted to hear both of your impressive speeches – every success with the financial perspective."
"Everyone needs to make a move here: those who have written the letters, but also the United Kingdom, so that we again prove that we are able to act."
"This will also serve to rebuild confidence all round."
"I wish the President-in-Office, the President of the Commission and of course the President of our own House every success."
"This crisis has to be seen as an opportunity!"
"We carry on down the same path, albeit perhaps not at such speed."
"We have understood the message, but we remain committed to Europe and Europe remains our major objective!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must confess that I am at a loss, and I do not think that I am the only one."
"Rarely have I found a speech as difficult as the one that I have to give this morning, because, as the spokesman for a group of over 200 Members, I have to try to draw together the diverse sentiments that the current situation has called forth in them."
"It is not easy, because it has been interpreted in many different ways."
"I should therefore like to add a few comments to what has already been said."
"I should like to underline one point: no country will allow another country to dictate how it implements its national law, and that is as it should be."
"We are a union of sovereign states."
"One country might say that it is going to suspend the ratification process, while another might say that it wants to ratify by parliamentary procedure or by holding a referendum."
"This is something that we in this House will have to take on board."
"Each country chooses how it wishes to proceed and each country is also entitled to do this as it sees fit."
"There is no golden-goal rule in the European Union, whereby someone scores a goal and the game is over."
"It cannot work like that."
"The 77% of Spaniards who said ‘yes’ to this constitution have the same value as the 55% of French people who said ‘no’ to it."
"That is why the process goes on."
"However, when interpreting the results, all of us – and I specifically include myself here – also need to ask some self-critical questions."
"What we have seen in the referenda is actually nothing new."
"It is just that for a very long time we have turned a blind eye to these developments."
"Every European election – in 2004, 1999, 1994, and even in 1989 – has showed similar tendencies: namely that increasing numbers of European citizens are turning away from the European project."
"None of us wanted to take this on board."
"This comment is directed particularly at me, for nor did I."
"This time it has been made abundantly clear that there is a gulf between the governments, the European institutions and the public."
"Why is there this gulf?"
"In the fifties, sixties and seventies, at the time of Jean Monnet or Helmut Kohl, of De Gaspari and Mitterrand, people did not read the treaties either."
"The citizens of Europe did not read the Treaty on the European Coal and Steel Community, but they had a trust in Europe, a basic confidence, a feeling."
"Europe promised peace and democracy, and peace and democracy were created for all to see."
"In other words, the claims matched up to reality."
"This created trust in the governments and in the European institutions."
"This promise of democracy and peace was complemented by a promise of prosperity, jobs and social security."
"The claim – more jobs, more social security, more protection – is not matched by visible results, because in many countries there are fewer jobs and less security."
"The public feel this gulf."
"And we are not making it any narrower, because we do not see the European Union sufficiently as an opportunity and because we do not present it as an opportunity either."
"And there is a reason for this."
"Alongside all this self-criticism that I am directing at us – at myself, this House and the Commission – there is one factor that cannot be overlooked and that should perhaps finally be discussed in the Council of 16 and 17 June."
"We all know that what we do in Brussels does not produce a direct relationship between ourselves and the citizens, but an indirect one."
"In between there are always the national governments."
"Their evil deeds of the past have now come back with a vengeance to haunt the governments of France and the Netherlands."
"You cannot claim every success for yourself as a national government and lay the blame for every failure at Brussels’ door, and then expect people to rejoice over Brussels."
"It does not work!"
"I therefore say very clearly: we in the European Parliament have a job to do."
"I agree that we need to talk more about subsidiarity, about cutting red tape, about improving effectiveness and increasing transparency."
"But the governments of the European Union must also assume their share of the responsibility, and that means saying what they are doing and then doing what they are saying."
"It is as simple as that!"
"Finally, I should like to say a few words about enlargement."
"Anyone who withdraws the prospect of enlargement from those states that are hoping for it is playing with fire!"
"Enlargement must remain a possibility."
"That is the unanimous opinion of our group."
"But promising enlargement before the foundations for that enlargement have been laid – the constitution was to be those foundations – is just as negligent."
"We cannot demand reforms and processes of transformation from other countries when we ourselves are not capable of putting our own house in order."
"That is why this Union has to do something."
"It has to reform."
"That is why giving Europe a constitution remains our objective."
"Because only with that constitution can European enlargement – and with it peace – become a reality."
". Mr President, Thomas Jefferson said in 1787, ‘a little rebellion now and then is a good thing’."
"Beyond the gloom and pessimism about Europe’s future, last week’s rebellion by our citizens could turn out to have some benefits."
"Member States are confronted with the outcome of their own duplicity."
"If you claim the credit for everything that goes right and blame Brussels for everything that goes wrong, then sooner or later your citizens will rumble you – and they have."
"When the VGE 380 was rolled out onto the tarmac last summer, we all cheered."
"But it has features and a name that are scaring away potential passengers."
"Some complain there are too many foreigners aboard, others that the new French and German specifications for the engines have weakened it."
"But nobody is completely satisfied with a vehicle in which strategic decisions are taken without proper public debate."
"That is a failing not just at EU level, but in our national debates too."
"For all our grand plans for transnational cooperation, we have failed to explain to people what we are doing at European level and why, and to address their fears about jobs, careers and a productive retirement in a fast-changing world."
"Europe is too secretive and too opaque."
"Too many decisions are still taken behind closed doors and without proper parliamentary scrutiny."
"Basic parliamentary prerogatives and formal opinions are ignored or dismissed, such as the opposition in this House to heavy-handed proposals on data retention or passenger data transfer."
"Is it any wonder that big projects like the Constitution are rejected, when even basic institutional respect is lacking?"
"The British Foreign Secretary has been accused of making funeral arrangements before the coroner has spoken, but he gave voice to what many are saying in private, that the Treaty in its current form is unlikely to survive."
"It would have been ideal to hear the opinion of all Member States."
"In future, any such ratification must be put to all European citizens at the same time."
"But these were votes to reject not a text, but the way our Union operates."
"Mr Schmit, Mr Barroso, we do not blame you for getting us into this mess, but we look to you for leadership in getting us out."
"Of course, there is a limit to how much a small Member State or the Commission can do."
"A huge responsibility rests on the larger beasts in the European jungle for the economic and social ills plaguing the Union."
"But since the Franco-German motor is clearly kaput, we want to see you building a new one."
"More than ever, Europe needs leaders with a sense of purpose and vision, who can inspire our citizens to maximise their potential and opportunity."
"If not you, then who?"
"With or without this Constitution, you can improve the way the Union operates and communicates."
"Here are just three ways: the Council could and should be more open, legislating in public, respecting freedom of information; justice and home affairs policy could and should be decided by the normal Community method, as provided for in the existing treaties; the European Parliament could and should be given a real say on international agreements."
"Those three steps would help to rebuild confidence in the European project."
"At the European Council, you need an answer from Chirac and Balkenende about whether this Constitution will ever be ratifiable in their countries and if not, what kind of text might be."
"We need a treaty for a Union of 27 Member States, but in the meantime there is much you can do to rebuild on the basis of the current treaties and restore public faith in the European project."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear today that everybody wants to tell some truths, and that is how it should be."
"The first truth: when, today, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe discovers that we should have proceeded to ratification on the same day, I would remind you that, when we proposed a European referendum across the whole of Europe, even this Parliament did not follow us."
"Today, everybody wishes we had held a European referendum on the same day because, even though it may indeed have resulted in defeat, we would not have this ridiculous problem of asking ourselves whether or not we should proceed with ratification: everybody would have voted on the same day."
"That is what I want to say and we have only ourselves to blame: why did Parliament not call for a European referendum, as we proposed?"
"The second truth: I think, and this needs to be said openly, that, with regard to the financial perspectives themselves, the governments and this Parliament have not yet understood what this is about."
"They have not yet understood that, if we want Europe to be capable of taking action for employment, for social protection, then we need to give it the means to do so."
"However, even the compromise proposed by Mr Schröder, even the compromise proposed by the others, is not a compromise that will give us the means."
"Once again, we are lying to our citizens."
"Let us say this clearly: either we have a budget that enables Europe to operate or we cannot promise anything for Europe."
"Just for once, let us tell them this truth."
"The third truth: let us be clear!"
"Mr Poettering, what happened in France was not a disappointment, it was a defeat, but today’s defeats will be tomorrow’s victories, I can promise you that."
"For that purpose, we, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, must really be able to set up and organise a convention with the Economic and Social Committee, with the Committee of the Regions, and with civil society, to reflect on and discuss Europe’s economic and social policies: what have been our successes?"
"What have been our failures?"
"Let us get to work!"
"Mr Schmit, open up the black box of the Council, debate in public on the 16th and 17th, so that the citizens of Europe know what you are going to say!"
"The people of Europe are fed up with these press conferences that follow Councils, during which each country, each government representative, only tells half the truth, taking care to disguise the other half, the things he has said behind closed doors."
"We, as European citizens and MEPs, have the right, like all citizens, to know what problems you have in Council, and how you respond to them."
"Not only what Mr Schröder will say to Mr Blair in public, but how the members of the Council respond when there are other positions, how they react to the positions of Mr Juncker, who wants to carry on, of Mr Blair, who wants to stop, of the Poles, who do not know, of the Danes, who do not know: we want all of that to be made public."
"The lack of transparency is one of the reasons for failure."
"Mr Barroso, this crisis is, in a way, an opportunity: we must seize it by telling the truth publicly."
"For example, with regard to globalisation, China, all of that, let us say once and for all that, yes, the WTO is important, but that the WTO can only work if it adopts the criteria of the International Labour Office."
"The problem is not to set up barriers against China, but to impose democratisation in China so that Chinese employees can fight for their salaries."
"If China does not accept this, then we must expel China from the WTO!"
"It is quite simple, and it is the same for other countries."
"We are fed up with it: business, always business, but when democracy is the issue, we are out at lunch."
"It cannot continue to work that way."
"That is what the citizens of Europe want to know!"
"That is why I would say to everybody: we have lost, yes, we lost in France, but, because I was part of the campaign, I do not want to lose again and I do not want to continue to lie on very clear matters."
"I will finish by recalling one of those lies: we need a European budget that will enable economic initiatives, we need to develop scientific research, but, to do so, it must at least be said that Europe is more interesting than the stingy proposals from governments as they are set out today."
". Mr President, Mr Schmit, Mr Barroso, should we continue, suspend or stop the process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty?"
"Should we suspend it and wait for better days?"
"Bravo for political courage, democratic rigour and confidence in the Constitution."
"In my view, nobody can refuse to give a population that wishes to express its opinion on the text the right to do so."
"At the same time, we owe it to every citizen to tell them the truth: from now on, it will be a process of consultation, not of ratification, because the draft Constitution is irrevocably null and void."
"It is void in legal terms, as it must receive unanimous approval in order to enter into force, and it is void politically given the power of the two ‘no’ votes and their impact in many other countries of the EU."
"So, what do we do?"
"What has just happened is not a French or Dutch thunderclap in a clear European sky."
"Yes, Mr Schulz, the crisis of confidence between the citizens and the European institutions has been continuing to widen and deepen since the great liberal watershed of the single market and of the Maastricht Treaty."
"As the years go by, it is no longer just the working classes, but the middle classes themselves who view this watershed as a swing towards a model of society that they do not accept."
"Competition at any price, runaway loss of security, cynical and relentless power struggles, consensuses reached at summits, behind closed doors: it is no longer acceptable!"
"There is a burst of dignity in this huge ‘no’."
"Many of these people still have dreams of Europe, but they are not dreaming about the Stability Pact or the Bolkestein directive."
"The crisis in Europe today truly is an existential crisis."
"We have already experienced other difficulties, Mr Barroso has just reassured us."
"No, this time it is a different matter."
"Until now, the political storms triggered by the infamous reforms so dear to the liberals in the Council and the Commission stopped at the borders of the Member States."
"What a massacre there has been on the left since the time, not so long ago, when it controlled more that two-thirds of the governments of the EU."
"Where the right held the reins until only recently, the approval was just as deafening, is that not true, Mr Barroso?"
"What did the European leaders, including the Council and the Commission, do after each of these popular ‘no’ votes?"
"They congratulated the winners and carried on with the same policy: business as usual!"
"Now, sooner or later, we will have to give explanations and accept real changes."
"So, how can we get out of this impasse?"
"First of all, by showing that we have understood the extent of European unease by clearly declaring the Constitutional Treaty to be dead."
"Next, by announcing, in the same spirit, the withdrawal of the most controversial texts, the most symbolic being of a tendency that should be stopped: the Bolkestein Directive, the Working Time Directive, and also the series of directives currently under discussion liberalising all over the place, without the slightest assessment of the effects of previous measures of a similar nature."
"I will conclude, Mr President, by addressing the benches on the left, who, whatever their position on the Constitution, share the conviction that we must now go down this route in order to relaunch Europe."
"Let us meet and do what we have to do so that confidence returns and hope is reborn."
"Mr President, what happened in France and in the Netherlands a few days ago can be summed up very briefly."
"The people wished to disassociate themselves from what Mr Barroso has called ‘Brussels’."
"That means, the people of Europe no longer have confidence in Brussels."
"Secondly, the second thing that is clear is that the Constitution is dead."
"It died in Paris and has been buried in Holland."
"I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit’s remark, ‘I do not want to tell any more lies’, and I call upon all European leaders to reject Europe’s scornful attitude and cease to be spokesmen for the European machine against their people and to become instead, quite simply and democratically, the spokesmen for their people among their peers."
"What do the people want? They want to remain free."
"In practical terms, therefore, that means deciding to suspend immediately the negotiations on the accession of Turkey."
"It means saying immediately that, in future, we will respect, and Europe will respect, the principle of national sovereignty. We must press for the notion of collaborative organisations of many kinds – political, industrial and scientific – all conforming to the principle of free membership and free cooperation."
"That is the formula for the future."
"Finally, and I will conclude here, we must put in place new mechanisms which will allow for a return to the common European preference, at least in those industrial sectors that are vulnerable, such as the textile industry."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the only formula that can possibly save Europe and re-engage and win back the people."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to be united politically by means of an economic and social project, and to revive development, Europe needs to have institutions that communicate with its citizens."
"The future depends on informed consent."
"The vote that took place in France and in the Netherlands does not mean a ‘no’ to Europe but the desire to stop going down the road where decisions are too often made at the top or without taking account of changing circumstances and new economic and social situations."
"It is precisely the employment crisis, caused by the social dumping carried out by a number of countries and the lengthy time taken by Europe in tackling the issue, that has created the insecurity and fear that prompted the ‘no’ vote on the Treaty."
"It was not so much a case of saying ‘no’ to the Treaty but to the poor information provided, which has also been acknowledged by the Commission in recent weeks."
"When it was drawn up, the Treaty was the best compromise possible, but it was not sufficiently well suited to the challenges already in play."
"What the people of Europe are demanding is to have clear, applicable rules, which respect the principle of subsidiarity and which are able to provide solutions not only to contingent issues but also to those issues that can be anticipated by analysing the geopolitical and geoeconomic context."
"The situation calls for a renewed sense of responsibility on the part of the three Institutions, in order that what is possible is carried out and the decision is made not to address what needs to be put off."
"After Bulgaria and Romania have returned to Europe, we believe that enlargement must end, in order that the Union may gather strength through dialogue between the Institutions and the citizens."
"At the same time, the links with the European Central Bank need to be addressed in a fresh way, because the Union will never have a future if the political bodies do not have the necessary influence on the drafting of monetary policy."
"We call on the Commission and the Council to pronounce on this issue without delay."
"The Union has already experienced difficult periods from which it has emerged with the introduction of new initiatives: as a result of the French National Assembly’s rejection in 1954 of the Treaty instituting the European Defence Community, the Conference of Messina was created, followed by the Treaties of Rome."
"As a result of the European Community’s stagnation in the 1970s, the Genscher-Colombo project came about, and following the vote at the European Council in Milan in 1985, under President Craxi, the Single European Act was attained."
"We are therefore optimistic that the new Europe can arise out of this very period in which it is clear that the headlong rush of the pro-Europeans and the pessimism of the Eurosceptics provide no guarantees for the future either of individuals or of society as a whole."
"Eurorealism is the only path of the present, and it is based on democratic choices and on respect for national identities, in order for a united and shared Europe to be constructed."
"– Mr President, the die is cast."
"The European Constitution is still-born. Just one vote against sufficed."
"There have been two votes, only three days apart, in France and in Holland, two of the six countries that were founder-members of the European Union."
"Tomorrow, it will be Great Britain, whose currency is not the euro, that will take over the Presidency of the Council, and it has already announced that it sees the process of ratification as useless."
"Never has the gap between parliaments and the people seemed so wide."
"Eight per cent of the members of the French Parliament voted no, but 55% of the people did so."
"It is, therefore, perhaps surprising that popular referendum is not the only means of ratification in all the countries of the European Union, seeing as it is the most democratic means which, in particular, those who complain in this House about the democratic deficit of the institutions might be expected to champion."
"It is true that it is dangerous for princes who govern for their own profit to give a voice to the people, who suffer to their detriment."
"It is against oligarchies – in politics, in the media, in the economy, in social affairs and elsewhere – which had far more powerful means at their disposal in the debate, that the people have spoken, refusing to give up their independence within a supranational state that, at one and the same time, showed itself to be ultraliberal, bureaucratic, economically mediocre and socially disastrous."
"They said no to indefinite enlargement, beyond Europe, to Turkey."
"Some will perhaps be tempted to get round the French and Dutch no votes."
"They should beware lest they provoke the legitimate wrath of the citizens."
"It would be wiser to take into account, and to consider, the will of the people and to endeavour to give the desirable aim of European cooperation a more realistic structure."
"It is clear that people do not want to give up their national structures. They are the bases of their identity, the defenders of their higher interests and the guarantees of their liberty, their cultures and their languages."
"They want to retain their sovereignty, over their territory and their boundaries, and to forge their own destiny and that of their children, given the threat posed nowadays by globalisation, immigration, social collapse and moral decadence."
"Mr President, a former Labour prime minister said that a week is a long time in politics."
"I suspect that, whatever one’s views on the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda, few would disagree with that observation."
"I do not want to go back over the issue of the Constitution and the referendum results, but I believe that it is now very difficult for the Constitution to be taken forward in its present form."
"We can dwell on that forever."
"What we should be doing this morning is looking at the positive sides of what is going on in Europe and what we can achieve outside of that situation."
"There must be an proper ongoing debate on the kind of Europe we want to build."
"The people have given a clear message and part of that message is that they feel alienated by the processes and by the institutions."
"That cannot be good for democracy and it undermines the trust we need from the people to carry out our responsibilities."
"However, we should now proceed with our programme and not be distracted too much."
"It is very important at the moment that there should be no delay in driving forward the Lisbon Agenda, the current liberalisation policies or the sustainable development arguments."
"As the President has said, we have to meet the challenges from China, India and other parts of the world with fast-growing economies."
"It would be quite wrong, therefore, to deny our people the chance of greater prosperity, because we are diverted and distracted, possibly for a long period of time, by a structural issue which seems to be going nowhere at present."
"So there is an urgent need for us to seize our opportunity for renewal."
"We have to grasp the scale of what has happened this week, but we must move on and forward in a way that meets with the approval of the European people as a whole."
"The Union has been offered this chance to rethink its future and face up to the profound questions concerning its future direction."
"But we must not allow ourselves to be diverted away from the policies that are already being developed and pursued vigorously and necessarily to benefit all of us."
"- Mr President, this is the second time that France has rejected a treaty of political union."
"In 1954 it was because of fear of German rearmament. In 2005 it is, without doubt, because of fear of global capitalism."
"We should see it also as an indicator for our own policies."
"What is to be done?"
"I believe we should be guided by three principles."
"The first principle is equality between the European nations."
"Ratification by Parliament is the equivalent of ratification by referendum."
"I have added together the results of the three referenda. When the Spanish, Dutch and French votes are taken together, the ‘yes’ vote wins by 54.04% of the votes, a figure that is a consolation for me, as a Frenchman."
"We need equality between the big countries and the small countries, equality for all the people."
"Nowadays, in 2005, I am not too keen on this word ‘founders’ because you, Mr Barroso, and you, Mr Borell, could not have been among the founders in 1957, because your countries were not members. You were living under dictatorships."
"Others were living under totalitarian regimes."
"We, the French and the Dutch, had the good fortune to be free."
"Consequently, we need now to be careful how we use that term."
"If a constitution has to be adopted unanimously, then it can only be rejected unanimously. The principle must be equally valid in either case."
"The second principle is, in the matter of enlargement, keeping one’s promises."
"I am thinking in particular of Romania and of Bulgaria and of others too, but I shall also add the Balkans."
"We must give to the Balkan states the prospect of entry into the European Union and we must hold to it."
"If we block this prospect, we shall be storing up a powder keg."
"The third principle is that Europe still needs, and will always need, a constitution. I say this in spite of the two ‘no’ votes."
"In France there is a that can show us the way."
"It is the of which Philippe de Villiers is President, the . In 1992 the voted ‘no’ to Maastricht, but it voted ‘yes’ to the Constitution."
"Mr de Villiers is completely at odds with the people of the whom he represents."
"You know, there is no need to go to Brussels to find a technocrat."
"A technocrat is merely a technician whom one dislikes, that is all."
"This shows us the way, so let us have confidence in the people of de Villiers’ ."
"– Mr President, we are living through difficult times and I want here to express the profound sadness that I feel and that is felt by all those, in the European Union and in the world, who are committed to the project of a political Europe."
"Europe is in crisis."
"Our Europe is in crisis, the Europe that we wanted and that we built."
"Of course, we all know that internal political issues had a significant influence on the French and Dutch results."
"We must, however, also have the courage to acknowledge that it is also a particular vision for Europe that has been rejected."
"For years, our people have had the feeling that Europe was being built without involving them, that they had no part at all in the decisions, often important decisions, that were being made on their behalf."
"Europe seemed to them foreign and distant. We are all, collectively, responsible for that."
"Our people also had the feeling that Europe was a project that was out of control, whose identity and whose boundaries were not defined."
"This feeling of uncertainty caused them to react with fear and rejection."
"Europe, then, has not fulfilled, and has not known how to fulfil, its protective role."
"It has not produced any answers to the question of globalisation, the difficult economic context that increasingly undermines our people’s support for the European idea."
"Today, the European project is not sufficiently clear or understandable."
"We have a major crisis of confidence and, in order to respond to it, European institutions must show that they are equal to the challenge."
"Their response cannot, and must not be, purely judicial."
"It must, first of all, be political, and, whatever might be the outcome of the ratification process, it is essential that the next European Council outlines the prospects and produces answers to the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"They very much expect democracy and transparency, they expect a clearly defined Europe and they expect a Union that establishes a genuine economic and social system of government."
"This is the only way to stimulate growth, employment and cohesion."
"We must act now. The matter is urgent."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like you to convey some sad news to your colleagues at the European summit."
"The scapegoat has done its duty, but it is in a wretched state."
"It has collapsed: it was left to the mercy of the public’s anger and they have subjected it to a cruel beating."
"What I am talking about is Europe, on the one hand, and the governments on the other."
"Not for the first time, but for the nth time, they have invited the public to vent their wrath on Europe, for matters for which they bear the responsibility."
"I know that the battle over how to interpret the ‘no’ vote has been raging for some time already, and whoever wins it will determine the course of events and identify the way out of the crisis."
"Is it the victory of nationalism over Europe?"
"Is it public discontent over our achievements, or is it – and this is my view – a public revolt against Europe as it is?"
"What is farcical about this is that the revolt against the Europe that we have makes the new Europe impossible."
"The patient was so angry about his illness that he shot the doctor, but you will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that I feel rather nervous when I see that it is precisely the governments that are once again gathering around Europe’s sickbed."
"What is then the existing Europe that the citizens are holding responsible here?"
"Is it really the dictatorship of the cold-blooded Brussels bureaucracy?"
"Is it really the kraken of a new superstate that feeds on the national identity of its citizens?"
"Or is it not rather this weak, ailing, irresolute Europe that has by no means overcome nationalism; the Europe of state chancelleries; the Europe of closed doors; the indecisive, asocial Europe; the Europe with the severe democratic deficit?"
"Is it not the Europe of governments, which in the arrogance of their power imagined that they could rule Europe on the side?"
"On the side – as the government, administration, legislator and even the provider of the constitution!"
"Is it not this Europe that we need to do away with?"
"Surely the governments bear more responsibility than the scapegoat that is being beaten here."
"Is it not true that the governments blocked the convention after trying to dominate it?"
"Did the social issue not founder there?"
"Mr President, for two months, I took an active part in the campaign which, in the Netherlands, won 62% backing for a ‘no to the Constitution’."
"As the largest organisation in the ‘no’ camp, our Socialist party stood up for the right of the electorate to change that text."
"We were not opposed to the prospect of a European Constitution, or to new or future Member States, or not even, more specifically, to the fact that the Netherlands has now become the highest net contributor in the European Union."
"It was about the content of the Constitution."
"That text is far too much a recipe for a Europe in a more American mould, with the emphasis on free, undistorted competition, the liberalisation of services, rearmament, commitment to NATO and the possibility of interventions outside the EU’s territory."
"Chapter 3 does not belong in a constitution; it should form part of normal legislation, which Parliament should be able to revise with the help of the national parliaments."
"It would then be for the electorate, through elections, to demand changes, and the man in the street would no longer feel himself unable to help change policies."
"Moreover, in the proposed text, democracy remains deficient as long as national parliaments can only delay legislation, as long as the collection of a million signatures is not rewarded with policy being adapted or with a referendum, and as long as the Council is the only body that can change this Constitution."
"With those arguments, we managed to persuade many people to turn out to vote who may well have grumbled about policy and the EU’s interference, but who were inclined to stay at home because they had no hope of any improvement."
"Instead of the expected low turnout with a majority voting ‘yes’, we had a high turnout with a majority voting ‘no’."
"This Constitution is now dead."
"If the voters in other Member States are offered another referendum, though, I also expect the majority to reject this Constitution."
"That is how peoples obtain the right to amendment ..."
"Mr President, the Dutch people have emphatically rejected the European Constitution."
"That is something that the European institutions would do well to recognise."
"The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty is primarily a rejection of the speed and direction of the European integration process."
"I fear that this lesson has not been learnt in Brussels, given the keenness with which reference is made to the impotence of national politics, the absolute lack of self-criticism and the pleas to continue the ratification process."
"At the Summit of 16 and 17 June, the Heads of Government must demonstrate that they have more of an understanding of the French and Dutch ‘no’ than many of my fellow Members."
"The surrounding the European Constitution requires adequate action."
"It is therefore incomprehensible that the political in Brussels should procrastinate and prefer the torture rack to the speedy advent of a new treaty."
"I am delighted that the voters have demonstrated a lack of confidence in a Europe that is defined indistinctly both in terms of geography and policy content, and which combines the unhealthy concentration of power with unrealistic political ambitions."
"Mr President, listening to the debate this morning you would imagine that, not only is there a European crisis, but that Europe does not have any answers or responses to the will and the wishes of the people."
"Whilst this is a difficult time, and whilst there is a lot of uncertainty, this is also an opportunity for us to reflect on what we have achieved so far, and to find a proper and more appropriate way forward."
"Unfortunately, that way forward will not be found by trying to analyse why the voters in France and Holland said ‘no’."
"There were many diverse reasons for their ‘no’ vote."
"At the same time, what do we say to the voters in Spain who voted in favour?"
"Do their votes count for nothing?"
"Those people who try and tell us that we must put off this whole process and stop and listen to the voice of democracy are totally ignoring the voice of democracy as represented by the nine other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution."
"I think it is important now that we give leadership to Europe."
"That leadership must come not only from this House, but also from the Commission."
"I congratulate President Barroso on his stance immediately after the vote in trying to encourage the governments to keep their nerve, to take a long-term vision, to use the same kind of ideology and the same kind of selfless desire to see an improvement for all the people of Europe that the founding fathers of the European Union showed when Europe rose from the ashes of the Second World War."
"The people within Europe today did not vote against more jobs, did not vote against better social protection, did not vote against better trade, did not vote against better Community development programmes, did not vote against giving more aid to the developing world, did not vote against protection for our environment, did not vote against ensuring sustainable development in fisheries and other industries."
"They voted in favour of all of these things because they wish to continue supporting them."
"It is now up to the Luxembourg presidency, as leader of the Council, to find a compromise and to find a way forward at the European Council meeting."
"The best way for us to present this to the people of Europe is to say that yes, we have hit a bump on the road, but this is not the end of the European project."
"We have to remind all the peoples of Europe that our best self-interest, as well as our best collective interest, lies in understanding our interdependency, not only in relation to single market economics, but also to our human responsibilities to each other across the European continent."
"– The Constitutional Treaty has already been ratified by ten states, including five old Member States Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain and five new ones Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia."
"These account for 50% of the population of the European Union; given that a founding country does not enjoy a privileged position, it could be said that the score is now ten to two."
"I do not know whether the French cured their unemployment problems, which they exploited in the run-up to the referendum, by means of the negative outcome of the latter."
"I believe that, on the contrary, they have abused the ideas and good will of the new Member States and, moreover, humiliated a major European country my neighbour, Poland by using the Polish welder as a symbol."
"I am calling upon Parliament not to weep over the negative outcome, nor to rejoice with some of those present here over the rubbishing of the idea of a strong Europe, but to take forceful and effective steps to facilitate the process in the future."
"It is also a sad fact, Mr President, that I am the first Member from a new Member State to speak on this item."
"Mr President, at the time of our last session we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the end of the war."
"It is an irony of fate that, today, we are debating a Europe in crisis, through lack of support from the people for a treaty that was designed to confirm that our countries should unite, for better and for worse, a treaty signed by democratically elected Heads of State or Government, acting on the authority of the sovereign power, and by that I mean the authority of the people of our countries."
"Two hundred and twenty million of them have already said ‘yes’ to this Constitution, and, Mr President, might I point out that Europe is more than just France and the Netherlands, or Great Britain. There are all the other countries too."
"Changing the text would be disrespectful towards almost half the population of the European Union, who have already ratified it."
"As far as the consultation process goes, I think it will also be up to those responsible at national level to decide what procedures to adopt."
"Of course, it will be up to the President-in-Office to act not only with skill and sensitivity but also with firmness."
"What is needed to convince the people is action and a financial perspective that will serve to demonstrate that Europe can stimulate the economy and create employment through investments in the major infrastructure or through ‘Galileo’, which could create 100 000 new jobs and is waiting for a signal from the Council to get under way."
"We will need also to communicate commitment to, and enthusiasm for, the European project and for its message of solidarity and humanism."
"In fact, this crisis is also a crisis for democracy."
"Europe can only work if its citizens believe in it. Often, delegation of power is synonymous with lack of interest, and we know only too well the dearth of information available on European policy."
"We need, therefore, to give more information, focussing on the most important points in our common policy, for the sake of our citizens and for a social Europe."
"Mr President, the ‘no’ vote was also the rejection of a Europe that puts the laws of the market and of competitiveness first, of a liberal Europe without any concern for the workers, and I say that for the benefit of those who were in favour of a 72-hour week."
"Mr President, the voters in the Netherlands and France gave us a clear message: Stop, we are hurtling along without knowing exactly where we are heading."
"In the Netherlands, 62% of the voters said ‘no’."
"It is now time we did something positive with those voters."
"The ‘no’ vote came from two different quarters."
"On the one hand, there is the right-wing voter who has a clear anti-European sentiment and says ‘no’ to the European project."
"There is, on the other hand, a ‘no’ vote from the progressive voter who is in favour of European cooperation but considers this Constitution too intrusive and lacking in the social dimension."
"These sentiments are also shared by those progressive voters who have voted in favour of the Constitution with some hesitation, in the belief that it was a step forward."
"We have to try to reunite those progressive voters from the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ camps for the benefit of a clearly defined European project."
"Needless to say, other countries must also be given the opportunity of speaking out about the European Constitution, but the die is cast in the Netherlands and France."
"Not this Constitution, not a second referendum on the same subject."
"We must avoid becoming isolated or marking time; quite the reverse."
"We want to mount a reform battle in Europe to demonstrate to both the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ voters that we have heard them."
"This reform must be based on a broad and open debate about the direction and speed of European integration."
"How many countries should we allow to join?"
"How do we make Europe strong and social?"
"The Council Summit on 16 and 17 June, and chaired thereafter by Mr Blair, may be able to make a start on thinking about salvaging the key elements, namely Chapters 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the principles of Europe, the improved weighting of vote, the high level of subsidiarity, accessibility, enhanced influence of national parliaments and citizens’ rights, in a simplified treaty."
"Otherwise, we might well end up in an Echternach-like procession where, unfortunately, we only take steps backward, without a prospect of realistically European cooperation, and as Mr Barroso was right in pointing out that ‘despite much public criticism, Europe is in actual fact the right answer and that is why I continue to be so committed’."
"Mr President, Europe has a problem and that problem cannot simply be solved by working on presentation or by explaining more effectively how good Europe really is."
"Europe may speak to the minds of many; it no longer speaks to their hearts."
"Bureaucracy has the appeal of reinforced concrete and the customer-friendliness of a rhinoceros."
"The European institutions must be forced to listen more carefully to the European citizens, and I am therefore delighted that President Barroso echoed this in what he said."
"For what are we frightened of?"
"Why should we not let the President of the European Commission be directly elected by all Europeans and why not have the possibility of a collective referendum about European laws?"
"Not 25 national referenda but one European referendum."
"Actually give the public the power over the European Union."
"The question now arises of what type of reform the European Union would be able to handle."
"The Constitutional Treaty would have enabled the EU to process the enlargement."
"How is that now to be proceeded with?"
"The MEPs in my party are for enlargement but consider it wise to put enlargement of the EU on ice until such time as we have sorted out our domestic affairs."
"After that, we will be happy to talk again about the accession of countries that meet the criteria."
"We need a new debate about what Europe is, where it is heading and where its borders are, and that debate should not be held among governments alone."
"It should be a Europe-wide, social debate about the economic and social future of our continent, again based, if need be, on something like the Convention, with a new mandate, a new composition and a new President. Europe must again be able to inspire people;"
"Europe must stand for quality, for creativity and for democracy, a safe, free, tolerant and prosperous Europe."
"Europe has a problem but it also has an opportunity, and we must not be held back by the past."
"Mr President, ‘Never have so many Europeans had so few to thank for so much’, is my message to the French people."
"Together with the Dutch people, they showed that they had grown tired of the Establishment continuing to push through proposals that transferred power away from the people and into the closed offices of government departments and the board rooms of large companies."
"The problem is not that the EU is moving ahead too quickly, but that it is heading in the wrong direction."
"The EU has got bogged down in yesterday’s problems."
"It is integrating states and maximising production instead of integrating people and maximising socio-environmental protection."
"Stop tormenting the Constitution."
"Allow it to die in peace, announce a new process in which each local authority has its own convention and then use their proposals for locally based European cooperation as a foundation for a new draft Treaty."
"Mr President, a year ago everyone here said that the Constitution would need unanimity."
"Of course, in those days it was thought that all the referenda would be won."
"In the David Goliath contest, the French people have aimed their stone well and they killed the Constitution."
"The Dutch then buried it and now, in a scene that reminds me of the Hammer House of Horror, the arm is reaching up out of the coffin."
"We are being told, no, no, it is not dead, the patient is still alive, and the ratification process will continue."
"That surprises me, because it seems to me that you are indulging in masochism."
"You are going to have a rather unhappy period."
"Mr Barroso, it is not a case of going too quickly, you are going in the wrong direction."
"Allied to that, I see the rapid rise of political extremism, of nasty nationalism, of blind nationalism; it is Euro nationalism and it knows no bounds."
"I know that you intend to treat the peoples of Europe with contempt by pushing this through without ratification."
"History will catch up with you."
"Mr President, I congratulate the people of France and Holland on bringing deliverance to all those in Europe who value democracy and national liberty."
"The situation that now exists challenges the democratic credentials of EU leaders."
"You set the test for the survival of the Constitution: ratification by all 25 Member States."
"You lost."
"It is time to face up to it and bury the corpse that is the EU Constitution."
"Your attempts to resuscitate it are as distasteful as they are ill-fated."
"Mr Watson’s reference back to 1787 tempts me to go back a little further."
"It is not the first time that Holland has saved Europe from political tyranny."
"This very week in that most notable of years 1690, William, Prince of Orange, landed at Carrickfergus in my constituency and brought us in the United Kingdom the Glorious Revolution and the Williamite settlement, which to this day is the basis of freedom ..."
"– Mr President, I feel that the major question on the table at the Council, and here in Parliament, is whether the people understand that we have in fact entered a new phase, one in which Europe no longer responds to the citizens’ concerns as it used to, when peace and democracy were the prime objectives."
"Nowadays, we want our European, national and institutional leaders to be equal to some of the main challenges, in a way that is objective rather than dogmatic."
"We therefore want to know whether the European social model is compatible with a form of globalisation that has been brought in at the cost of the kinds of social dumping and environmental dumping that prevail in other countries and that have led to relocations and unemployment in Europe."
"It is important, indeed crucial, that Europe – either of its own volition or if possible in conjunction with the United States, starting with the Doha Round – takes measures to ensure compliance with International Labour Organisation rules, in the same way that the Lisbon Strategy must become less bureaucratic and more entrepreneur-friendly and SME-friendly."
"This is also the case with subsidiarity, which we have heralded but which in practice the institutions consistently overlook."
"The Commission, and more importantly Parliament, must take action to ensure, once and for all, that subsidiarity is properly implemented across the board."
"Lastly, we need to be aware of Europe’s limits and of the pace of enlargement, when the process of deepening has not been successful."
"These are the European Council’s main challenges."
"– Mr President, in a democracy, the majority vote must always be accepted and respected, even if the majority is not necessarily right."
"The French and the Dutch votes are irrevocable."
"The message, however, is not clear."
"It is actually a multiple ‘no’, with mixed and sometimes conflicting motives."
"Between the demagogues of the extreme right and the demagogues of the extreme left there is no common denominator."
"The national socialists who are hoping they can draw together all the malcontents will soon find out that this will turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory."
"What is to be done?"
"As there is no plan B and no one knows what improvements would be likely to transform these contradictory and ill-assorted ‘no’s’ into a clear and resounding ‘yes’, the only option is to play it by ear."
"The next summit has to approve a financial perspective that will enable the institutions to function normally."
"Just as the Eurogroup has elected in advance a president for two years, so governments should put in place other actions in anticipation of the treaty, relying on a voluntary agreement."
"Thus, the Commission would have to consult national parliaments on any future legislative initiatives."
"The ‘no’ vote will stop neither globalisation, nor international competition, nor relocations."
"After all, the world’s leading exporter cannot be allowed to operate selfish protectionism."
"It is necessary, therefore, to forge new links not only between Europeans but also with the many countries that remain outside of the globalisation process."
"The accession of Romania and Bulgaria will take place under the terms of the Treaty of Nice."
"Even Turkey could join us under the terms of that treaty."
"Of course, the European Union could function better within the framework of the treaty that has now broken down."
"Since, however, the ‘no’ vote offers no solution, we have to show, difficult though it may be, that Europe carries on, while striving better to meet the needs of our citizens through more imaginative and more supportive policies."
"Mr President, it is with some sadness that I hear the reactions to the Dutch and French ‘no’ votes."
"Europe is too bureaucratic, too expensive; too many new countries have joined and Europe is going too fast."
"I would beg to differ."
"The environment is going faster, China’s economy is growing more rapidly, and so is international crime."
"Rather than needing to take its foot off the accelerator, Europe must take a great leap forward."
"As for the enlargement, to be frank, I am relying on the dynamism of the new countries as new driving force for European integration."
"We need a strong, democratic Europe; we do not need less of Europe, but more."
"I would actually like to appeal to anyone who holds Europe dear to show leadership and courage; if not, we will give the populists and extremists too much scope."
"We must move forward, and national politicians must be able to leave the past behind and take responsibility for Europe."
"I am, in fact, concerned about the Council’s position yesterday in respect of data retention when the Council decided to completely blank the European Parliament, which is not in the spirit of the debate that has taken place."
"We should not forget that in addition to the two countries that said ‘no’, there are also ten countries that said ‘yes’, and that is an important fact."
"I would therefore be against suspending the whole process."
"It is evident that time is needed to reflect, but I think that every country and every people must have the right to speak out about this Constitution."
"It is right now that we need to take up the cudgels for Europe."
"Instead of reverting to the , we need to redouble our efforts for Europe."
"Mr President, the Constitution is dead in France and buried in the Netherlands, yet the Council’s otherwise decent President-in-Office is behaving like a body snatcher in wanting to continue with the process of ratifying the rejected document."
"Start afresh."
"Allow a working party with equal numbers of supporters and opponents to get together and prepare a discussion paper with draft ground rules capable of uniting Europe instead of dividing us."
"This Parliament’s Referendum Group would be happy to be involved."
"We have seven current demands concerning openness, the election of Commissioners, majority voting with the right of veto, the principle of proximity, the right of control by the national parliaments, minimum flexible conditions, and enhanced cooperation instead of compulsion."
"Read our proposal."
"We have tested the first two demands by means of an opinion poll in Denmark."
"They were supported by 80% of the electorate and opposed by only 12%."
"It is that level of support that we need to have for common ground rules."
"Use your ears, listen to the electorate and do come to our press conference at 4 p.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"We cannot deny it: the French ‘no’ vote represents a strong, decisive ‘halt!’ to the process of European integration, in the form that it has been taking ever since Maastricht."
"By signing, the Treaty introducing the single currency and launching the political cohesion process, back in 1992, Europe knew that it was embarking on a journey that should completely transform both the institutional model and the overall shape of the Union, by gradually abandoning the geopolitical structure of the Cold War."
"Many of the cogs in this mechanism have not worked, however, and many of the issues opened up by the Treaty of Maastricht are still on the agenda today."
"It is time to make clear choices about the shape of the European dimension: a decision needs to be made about whether or not the Lisbon perspective should really be pursued, by postponing the associated projects of common interest; the areas and the limits of political integration need to be redefined; and, in a clearer manner than in the Constitutional Treaty, the choice of a free and competitive economic and social system has to be reaffirmed, a system that is genuinely capable of making Europe a leading player in the ongoing process of globalisation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bonde said that he wanted equal representation from both sides, but this Parliament decided to support the constitution by a majority of 80-90%, and 52% of the population, through their parliaments and in referenda, have already said ‘yes’ to it!"
"This should not be forgotten."
"Moreover, it is clear – and this point has been made by many speakers – that there is a mixed bag of reasons for the ‘no’ vote and that the constitution itself is the least significant of them all."
"They include the unpopularity of national policies, fear of globalisation and unemployment, as well as a desire to give us the message: ‘you have gone too far in terms of both internal legislation and enlargement, and quite a lot more besides’."
"But it has been examined and found wanting, and this is something we should take on board."
"That is why it is extremely important to have a period of reflection, in which we show ourselves to be restrained and moderate, and make it clear, by adopting appropriate policies, that we can win back the hearts of the people if we hold a dialogue of this kind."
"I believe that we need this time for a suspension of the ratification process, so that we do not accumulate even more no’s on these false premises. In this way we can then move forward during the Austrian Presidency, at an appropriate time, not with an intergovernmental initiative, but perhaps with a convention that could scrutinise the results of this reflection – the results of the period of reflection, not of the constitution."
"I also think it is extremely important that we also present this in positive terms; according to the constitution, this European Union means nothing other than involving the citizens, giving the citizens rights, ushering in more democracy, giving the national parliaments more rights, and enabling us to act on the global stage in such a manner as to guarantee our internal and external security."
"It also means that we can make it clear that Europe is not part of the globalisation problem, but part of the answer to it, and that for these reasons we are capable of winning back the hearts of our citizens for our policies."
"It is this course of action that I commend to you."
"If I may, I will add a footnote."
"All of this will also cause a paradigm shift in Germany, because Germany will once again be on the side of the small countries, which is important for the identity of this Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest task for the European Council in a week’s time is to create clarity, more clarity and yet more clarity."
"The worst decision that could be taken in a week’s time would be to continue in the same old way, in which clarity is hardly the watchword."
"With a whole series of referenda, there is a risk of setting a self-perpetuating spiral of ‘no’ votes in motion."
"I should like to say that clarity is the fundamental requirement."
"What, moreover, I fear, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that, if no clarity is brought about, the real choice we shall face will be that between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time; and, if I have to choose between being satisfied with the Treaty of Nice and gaining a little more time to think through how we resolve the situation, I prefer to have more time."
"We cannot live with the Treaty of Nice."
"We cannot solve the problems using the Treaty of Nice."
"We must have this Constitutional Treaty in place and, if more time is needed, then that is what I prefer to have."
"Mr President, we can hold all the conventions and present all the treaty documents we like, but that will not help if we do not tackle the real problems in Europe."
"In the course of two years, this Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the European Socialist Party, of which I am President, have presented clear calls for Europe to invest in more new jobs and to unite behind a common response to what many ordinary people see as the threats of globalisation."
"Our greatest task now, under the British Presidency – and I really do think we have received some very exciting signals from Prime Minister Tony Blair – is to combine people’s need for social protection with new jobs in a globalised world."
"I also very much support the call by the President-in-Office of the Council and by the President of the Commission for us to have the financial perspectives in place in a week’s time."
"That would be the most important signal of all that we are not incapable of making decisions but that we take people’s concerns seriously."
"Mr President, President Barroso said that we should not start the blame game."
"However, we should certainly question the credibility of the European Council in stimulating and managing the great debate about the social and economic future of Europe."
"The European Council should, and probably will, suspend the ratification process but it should not pull the plug on the whole constitutional project."
"Instead, it should agree in principle to set up a new convention – pluralistic, parliamentary and transparent – with a broader brief than that of Laeken, especially to modernise and refresh Part III, to bring the common policies into line with the aspirations and anxieties of our citizens."
"The new convention should also be asked to break the rigid relationship between the first, second and third parts and to create a proper hierarchy between them, so that in Part III the policies become distinctly subsidiary to Part I."
"This Group and Parliament will play a full part in fostering such a convention."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the draft Constitutional Treaty was comprehensively rejected in France and the Netherlands, in what amounted to a clear vote of no confidence in national and European political elites."
"To our astonishment, however, there are those who are attempting to resurrect this document."
"It has been suggested that the ratification process should be continued and the draft Treaty renegotiated, and the search is even on for legal means of negating the outcome of the referenda."
"Such measures should be regarded as both anti-democratic and arrogant, and come dangerously close to totalitarianism."
"The political elites should realise that the majority of Europe’s nations are opposed to the establishment of a bureaucratic, Brussels-run superstate monopolising social, economic and monetary policy."
"Instead, they wish to participate democratically in decision-making processes and in European integration based on free cooperation between free countries."
"Heads of State or Government who disregard the sovereign will of their nations may well find that the latter regard them as dictators, and deal with them accordingly."
"Mr President, this debate is in the first place about the forthcoming European Council and I should like to focus on it, for in this moment of crisis, this European Council has a very important task, namely setting beacons, and the first beacon should be for Europe to continue to function and to carry out its task, not only internally, but also externally."
"I was delighted to hear President Barroso make reference to our duty in the area of development cooperation."
"The key marker will undoubtedly be when an agreement is reached about the financial perspectives, because that must provide the framework for Europe to function in the next few years."
"Much as I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that those financial resources will probably be too low to allow Europe to carry out its task properly, it does strike me as crucial that an agreement be first and foremost reached on those financial resources."
"Secondly, the European Council must also give an indication as to how we should progress from here, because the questions we raised in the Laeken Declaration remain unanswered as yet."
"We still have no framework for this enlarged Europe, Europe still has to provide an answer to globalisation and that answer can only be European."
"However, we should take into account the ‘no’ in two countries, but also the ‘yes’ in ten other countries."
"I think that when Mr Rasmussen says that ‘the European Council must provide clarity’, that this European Council is as yet unable to provide clarity in the short term, because the ‘no’ is far too diffuse for that."
"That is why I call for a period of reflection, but it has to be organised and limited in time."
"We need to decide clearly beforehand when conclusions will be drawn, and a year strikes me as an appropriate timeframe."
"Indeed, it would be best to suspend matters, but not indefinitely."
"It must be a defined period of reflection, clearly limited in time with a clearly specified time when conclusions will be drawn."
"– Mr President, far from being dead, as some are saying, the constitution is alive and must be kept alive, for there is, as far as I am aware, no plausible alternative to it."
"There is no plan B that is at all likely to succeed."
"That has also become clear in this debate."
"We may need more time."
"That is why each country should decide for itself when to proceed to ratification."
"However, I think it is completely wrong to call a collective halt to the ratification process and suspend it across the board."
"That is surely wrong!"
"Each country must decide this for itself, bearing in mind that we may need more time."
"The ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands have severely damaged those countries’ status as founders."
"There is also a positive side to this, because now perhaps all of the countries are on an equal footing."
"Above all, I hope that the new countries will say a hearty ‘yes’, because they have to understand that part of the ‘no’ was also directed at them."
"I hope that the people of Poland and the Czech Republic will say a clear ‘yes’ to the European constitution, because this is their future and also their project for the future in Europe."
"Obviously, we also need to respond to the public’s concerns."
"The people are saying: we want more information; we want more participation; we want more clarity about the European project, and we want more information about its future direction."
"Let us actually give people these opportunities!"
"I believe that project D, to which Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, referred, is a possible way forward."
"Let us together organise a grand European debate about the future of European unification, not 25 separate national debates, but one joint debate."
"We need an instrument."
"Some people are saying another convention, perhaps ‘European assizes’, or some kind of instrument."
"It is next week, at the summit, that the signal for this new start ought to be given."
"Mr President, Europe was unable to win the obstacle race."
"The Constitution failed to clear all the fences."
"This European Constitution was the favourite, but it lost the race."
"Did it lose, though, because the text was not good enough?"
"Did it lose solely because of European considerations?"
"I think not."
"Rather, I think that the ground had not been prepared and that the Constitution had to compete with rivals doped up with lies."
"We must all react – the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"What have the voters said to us?"
"‘Sorry, we do not really know Europe."
"On the other hand, the situation in our own country has deteriorated, so we will make use of our power to say so’, and they voted for superficial reasons."
"The results are there, and we have to draw our conclusions from them."
"For too long, some of our governments have turned their backs on the emergence of a real European culture."
"In saying that, I am, of course, thinking of France."
"How many generations of ministers of all persuasions have been suddenly afflicted with amnesia in the course of moving between Brussels and their own capitals?"
"Between the moment when, sitting in the middle of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and speaking on behalf of their country, and the moment when they explain a measure, all of them seem to have severe memory lapses."
"In Brussels they approve a European measure, which, if it is popular, is immediately credited to the government’s initiative."
"On the other hand, if an action is indispensable, but unpopular, it is Europe that is held responsible."
"This attitude has led us to a sorry state."
"For too many years now, no one speaks about Europe."
"Enlargement has not been properly explained."
"We have moved too fast in the face of public opinion that was not prepared, with people having the feeling of putting up with things rather than participating."
"Making people like Europe means finding ways of making it understood."
"One of the major errors in relation to this Constitutional Treaty was not to have organised popular or parliamentary consultation on the same day in all the Member States."
"Let us remember, however, that ten countries voted ‘yes’ and that it is only by integrating the European debate within all issues of national politics that we can manage to avert the populist hurricane that is now sweeping over our countries."
"Mr President, continuing with the ratification procedure in the remaining Member States would have the attraction of showing that this Constitution does have the support of the majority of Member States and of the peoples of the European Union."
"But it is a risky strategy in some ways."
"It risks further 'noes', it risks giving the impression that we are proceeding with business as usual without listening, and of course it also poses the question of whether you can easily ask the French or the Dutch to vote again on the same text without further ado."
"Something else has to happen."
"We need the European Council to agree collectively on how to proceed."
"It is no good some countries going ahead with ratification whilst others have pronounced the text dead."
"We need a common agreement."
"I think that agreement must comprise a pause for reflection at some stage for further debate and for further adjustment, with two stages."
"Firstly at national level: those countries that have said 'no' or that risk saying 'no' must be able to think and tell the rest of the European Union how they see the way forward, what adjustments they think are necessary."
"Then secondly at European level: we must make this a European debate, not just another quick IGC behind closed doors, but a public debate."
"That is why I think reconvening a new Convention with a new president might not be such a bad idea."
"It does after all meet in public."
"It involves national parliamentarians."
"It involves people from governing parties and opposition parties."
"It would be the way forward."
"It would get far more public attention than the previous Convention."
"There is no easy way forward."
"We must find a way because we cannot afford to lose the reforms contained in this Constitution."
"We need a European Union that is more effective and more democratic."
"– Mr President, the discussions which will be held at the European Council next week will, unfortunately, take place under the shadow of the two novotes on the European Constitution, two novotes which lead us to the conclusion that we now need to hold a fundamental, joint debate on the future of Europe."
"In this debate, we shall need – if we have understood the message sent to us by the citizens of France and the Netherlands – to examine all the political, economic, social and cultural issues which concern – and they must concern – the citizens of the European Union."
"The conclusions of this debate will probably cause us to re-examine the policies adopted and followed up to now by the European Union, both within the Union and in its foreign relations."
"We should not be frightened by the idea or of the possibility of re-examining policies."
"On the contrary, European integration, as a dynamic process, also encompasses the need to re-examine policies as and where necessary."
"I have a feeling that, today more than ever, we need to remain faithful to the European idea."
"However, precisely because we need to remain faithful to the European idea, perhaps the time has come for us to re-examine and redefine its content."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why do we complain so much that politics has entered European life?"
"We all know that politics is not a long calm river and that sometimes it can also be a furious current."
"I would like to say, firstly, that this process must continue, because we are all equal, we all have the right to express ourselves, and our precursors, the Swiss, have also expressed themselves in favour of the European Union in a referendum in which they decided to enter Schengen."
"Secondly, a ‘no’ is worth as much as a ‘yes’, but a ‘no’ is not a right to veto, and those who have said ‘no’ must say what they want to do."
"Do they want to stay with us or to leave?"
"They must say it, not us."
"Since I am the first speaker who comes from a country that has said ‘yes’ in a referendum, please allow me to give some pieces of advice."
"Firstly, in Spain we held a referendum on the European Constitution and I would like to pay tribute to all the opposition parties, who talked about Europe and not about our domestic problems."
"Secondly, we must talk about Europe and we must speak well."
"As Mr Zapatero said during the campaign, to speak well about Europe is a weapon of mass construction."
"We have expressed clearly our gratitude for the ‘Marshall Plan’ which has come to us from Europe and we have tried to generate hope."
"Because there is much talk here about problems and complaints, but our duty is to generate hope and responses to the problems of the people, not to complain."
"I must say that we need to reflect on what must be done, but we must not stop."
"If we stop, the ‘no’ syndicate will say that it has won and that is a risk we cannot accept."
"I will end by saying to the President-in-Office of the Council that it should add two things to its list: we must defend the euro and we must work actively within the Doha Round, which is where globalisation is going to be debated this year."
"Mr President, next week’s European Council summit will be one of the most important in the history of European integration."
"We all realise that a wrecked Constitution would leave Europe as it was before the start of the ratification process."
"If we wish to avoid Europe getting bogged down in a long-term crisis, the Council will have to be vigorous in taking the lead."
"There are two possible solutions available to us now."
"If the French President and the Dutch Prime Minister say that they will resubmit the document for approval, then we shall continue with integration."
"If they are unable to do so, we shall create a political basis by separating the first and second parts of the Constitution from individual common policies."
"The Convention, of which I was a member, came to the view that if the EU were to achieve effective reform, it would need not only to organise relations between institutions and incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also to consolidate existing agreements, including policies."
"However, neither the Convention nor the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference had the political will to separate these two problems from each other."
"We are here, Mr President, because France and the Netherlands rejected the Constitution."
"Debate in those countries revealed dissatisfaction with many current European policies, and not with the institutional solution that the Constitution would have brought about."
"Citizens were forced to decide on both questions at once, however."
"The European Council should therefore take independent decisions on the separation of the constitutional framework in Chapters 1 and 2 and its submission for ratification."
"The first and second parts of the Constitution are a balanced document upon which consensus was reached within both the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Everything now depends on whether or not the European Council can find the will to take a courageous step forward."
"If we cannot, we risk the acute crisis we are facing with regard to the ratification of the Constitution becoming a chronic crisis affecting the entire integration project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ratification is an ongoing process, and the right and duty of every state."
"This is why the process must not be halted merely because two countries have said ‘no’."
"I would urge the Members of this House who have today called for a halt to ratification to respect democracy and the sovereign right of each state to take autonomous decisions on this issue."
"As a Polish citizen, I too should like to have my say on the matter."
"I should like to have my say on the Constitution, and I do not believe that anyone should deprive me of this right, or tell me that France and the Netherlands have already decided on my behalf and on behalf of all Poles."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"Still bearing in mind the outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the second point I should like to make is that the Polish people have been very much alarmed by the tone and direction of the debate in these countries."
"I am not merely referring to the omnipresence of the proverbial Polish plumber."
"This debate, which in fact was only incidentally concerned with the European Constitution, prompted us to ask ourselves the following key question. If this referendum had taken place before the recent enlargement, would we, and by we I mean the 10 new Member States, still have joined the EU?"
"Have we joined an EU based on solidarity, or a selfish EU that is locking its doors?"
"I hope to hear answers to these questions after the forthcoming summit, which I believe will get to grips with this tricky situation."
"Mr President, we have been inundated with a multitude of analyses, interpretations and speculations ever since the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"An oft-repeated claim is that the victory of the ‘no’ camp in these countries was a public protest against the recent EU enlargement, and that the failed referenda are a form of punishment for what happened one year ago."
"Continuing in the same vein, the conclusion drawn from this is that the brakes must be put on enlargement, and that accordingly we must wait until the EU has ‘digested’ the new Member States, much as a boa constrictor might swallow and digest a rabbit."
"People have already expressed doubts, both in this Chamber and elsewhere, as to whether allowing Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU on 1 January 2007 was a wise move."
"The decision to open negotiations with Turkey in October is quite openly being called into question, and Ukraine’s European ambitions are being written off."
"Of course, no one can be forbidden from expressing these and similar opinions."
"It would be a grave mistake, however, if they were to form the basis for restrictive political decisions, and there are at least three reasons why this is the case."
"Firstly, we must not go back on the commitments we made, and that were made to the citizens of the EU candidate countries."
"I would remind the House that we must not only abide by principles when it suits us, and when they are in any case redundant, but also when we encounter difficulties in doing so."
"Secondly, every enlargement carried out to date has been an economic success."
"Thirdly, the European Union is not intended to be an elite, members-only club."
"It should be quite the opposite, namely an open area of democracy, respect for human rights and minorities and peaceful methods of conflict resolution."
"In my opinion this last point is of particular significance, as it represents both the essence and the mission of the European Community."
"Unless this mission is accomplished, not only will the Constitutional Treaty be killed off, but also the EU itself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of Europe and its integration always were, are, and will continue to be very complex processes, in which two steps forward are often followed by one step back."
"In the past year, we have made two steps forward – simply consider the unprecedented and successful enlargement of the European Union to include 10 new members."
"The outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands are, of course, a step back."
"It is an enormous disappointment, and one I feel myself, since I come from one of the new Member States."
"Neither in France nor in the Netherlands, however, does this mean the end of the integration process, and I am convinced that this does not necessarily mean the end of the European Constitution."
"I believe and expect that the European Council will send out a clear message to the effect that the other Member States should also be able to express their views on the European Constitutional Treaty."
"The score so far is 10 countries in favour and two against."
"I think that the people of Poland, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Denmark should have the right and the opportunity to say whether or not they want the European Constitutional Treaty, and only then, on that basis – as provided for in the Constitution – should the Council decide next year what to do with the document."
"I would like to say one more thing regarding the Financial Perspective."
"I believe that a compromise will be reached on 16 and 17 June allowing Europe to move forward with the help of financial resources, which are, of course, necessary if we are to achieve our goals and realise our ambitions."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from a legal point of view, this treaty, as everyone knows, has failed."
"Politically, the need to bring it into force is even more urgent than ever before."
"That is why we have to ask ourselves how we can help to advance the ideas outlined in the treaty."
"From this point of view, I wonder how wise it is now to expose the treaty to a series of public executions in the form of referenda."
"I think it would be much wiser to take time to reflect, so as to give the treaty a chance."
"This time should be used to clarify a few questions."
"Now is not the time or place for answers or magic formulae; now is the time for questions."
"One question is: have we in Europe perhaps reached the limits of integration?"
"Are we not in the process of transferring more and more competences from the Member States to the Union, only for them to be managed there in procedures that are democratically rather dubious and in any case opaque and highly bureaucratic, to the extent that they are impossible for any citizen to understand?"
"You might go to the Commission, examine all of the draft directives lying around there, and only find one in which a clear distinction is drawn between what needs to be regulated in Europe and what is best left in the hands of the Member States and their regions."
"I would bet that there is not one single directive in which this kind of subsidiarity culture is fostered."
"We must turn our attention to these issues."
"The second question is this: have we perhaps reached the limits of enlargement?"
"No one knows how far the enlarged Union should extend. Ukraine, Belarus, Morocco, Israel – in the past all of these countries have been discussed."
"This lack of a boundary breeds uncertainty, and uncertainty breeds rejection."
"That is another reason why the voters said ‘no’."
"Seen in this light, giving Turkey candidate status was a failure of historic proportions on the part of the Union, and one about which we need to think long and hard."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the events taking place serve as a lesson for the future."
"This method of ratification has proved to be a mistake and one referendum on a single day would have been better."
"If we had had more courage then, we would not be in this situation today."
"The June European Council, as has been mentioned, will now have to be able to read the signals resulting from the ‘no’ vote in the referendum and find an exit route."
"It is increasingly clear, however, that there are two possible solutions in play: the first – as we have also heard in this House – is less Europe: it should turn back, slow down, stop enlargement, culminating in the foolishness that I have even heard in my country about the euro."
"The second is to relaunch a fresh challenge that proposes more Europe – I would say the real Europe."
"Yet if we do, however, want this second solution to prevail, as I do, we have to be able to innovate and change, and denounce the fact that we are paying for the hold-ups of recent years: we are paying for the hold-ups of Nice and of Lisbon, and the lack of resources to match our ambitions."
"Moving forward is therefore right, as it is right to denounce the part played by national selfishness."
"That setback must inspire us, however, to determinedly address the unresolved difficulties, and then Europe will genuinely be able once again to harbour hopes of tackling afresh those fears, uncertainties and anxieties experienced by our citizens today."
"– Mr President, the question is actually always: national populism or European, social, shared responsibility?"
"That is why I would like the Council to take as its motto, ‘recollection, not reversal’."
"I would ask you to produce a code of conduct for all of those who sit on national executives or European legislatures, so as to put an end to the culture of blame and double moral standards."
"They should say the same in Brussels as they do at home."
"They should be prepared to shoulder their share of responsibility rather than allocating blame."
"They should provide information, rather than ignoring the public’s questions and fears."
"As well as drafting this code of conduct, I hope that you will open the door for a limited period of reflection, and that you will produce an information and communication strategy that will open a democratic debate with the public, so that the ratification process can continue successfully thereafter."
"– Mr President, the situation that we are now facing is called crisis."
"It would be futile and dangerous to deny it."
"Being clear, however, does not mean making gestures."
"We must not give up so easily."
"Each country has to decide on the Constitution according to its own constitutional rules."
"In the meantime, we must reflect on the consequences of the apparent absence of unanimous ratification so as to establish as quickly as possible a new consensus for a political Europe, which we must not give up on."
"Nevertheless, what Europeans have expressed by their vote or by their attitude needs close analysis and it calls first for changes in European politics and in the way they are conducted."
"Europe has to get out of the somewhat schizophrenic state in which it operates on a daily basis."
"Decisions are made at supranational level but debates are exclusively at national level."
"Henceforth, the debate in each country should focus on the common issues and on European interests, as was the case in the French referendum campaign."
"For the time being, Mr President, the European Council has to bring stability to the system as it is and show that it has clearly heard the message. For me, that means, as a priority, persuading the Central Bank to lower its key interest rate, as this is essential for growth."
"We need to put in place real policies for industry and research and move from discussion to decisions and from decisions to action on asylum and immigration, on justice and common policy. We need too to postpone the start of negotiations for the accession of Turkey in order to introduce into the terms of negotiation the notion of a privileged partnership."
"Mr President, we can overcome the crisis and move forward if we act democratically."
"Let us make the European policies that the people demand of us."
"– Mr President, a great many people in Europe are dissatisfied."
"They feel overwhelmed by too many laws and uncertain in key areas of their lives: on the labour market, in the various different social security systems and in terms of how safe and secure they feel."
"People react how and where they can."
"They say ‘no’ to the political establishment in elections and they say ‘no’ in the referenda on the European constitution."
"In this situation, we politicians must respond calmly and perceptively. Neither ‘business as usual’ nor quick-fire responses and over-reactions are called for."
"It would in any case be wrong to make the constitution a scapegoat."
"It is not the problem, but at best a way of resolving our problems in Europe and with Europe more effectively."
"We European politicians should therefore take the trouble to consider how we can turn this situation round."
"I agree with those who want to suspend the process of ratifying the treaty for a certain period."
"This could put a stop to the negative domino effect."
"However, the decision-making process should then be re-started, perhaps even in a coordinated form, with the remaining decisions on the constitution all being made at the same time."
"I would like to see a week for Europe next July."
"Mr President, I do not find it easy or pleasant to speak today."
"I have put a lot of thought into the position my group should take and the position this Parliament should take with regard to the ratification process."
"I believe that Europe has always made progress on the basis of consensus."
"I have observed today — as has been said — that, despite the fact that 10 Member States have ratified it, despite the fact that many Europeans have said yes to the Constitution, there is no consensus to move forward."
"I note that the text of the Constitution is not being debated, but rather the political context."
"I therefore believe that the worst thing we can do is not to look carefully at the reality and not to concentrate on what the people are asking for."
"The people are asking us to listen, to debate and to hold dialogue."
"I believe, today as I did yesterday — perhaps more firmly than yesterday — that the Constitution is necessary for Europe; and since I believe that it is necessary and that we must save it, the most logical thing — and this is the position of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats — is that the ratification process be delayed."
"I believe that, if the Heads of State or Government take a unanimous decision in this regard, we will all have time — perhaps one year until the end of the Austrian Presidency — to consider what we should do about the Constitution, how we should explain these things to the people, how we should re-establish contact with them."
"It is at times like these, these difficult and unpleasant times, that the importance of people becomes clear, when we must not just do nothing and see what happens, but rather we should do what we believe to be most useful in order to implement something that we believe to be necessary."
"I believe that the Constitution is necessary."
"And since this is a difficult situation and a painful decision, my group, which has reflected carefully, believes that the best option is that of delay at this time."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all the Members for their observations, their advice and the views they have expressed."
"I should like first to congratulate Parliament. Long may it last!"
"If there were a fresh vote today on the Constitution, it would be clear that, in this Parliament, the Constitution is not dead. It is very much alive."
"That is the task before us all."
"It is a very difficult task, but one that we must carry out with determination and with tenacity."
"All of those who have been members of the Convention have, to some extent, been deluding themselves because we really, honestly and sincerely believed that this Convention was very much in tune with public opinion and with the hopes and wishes of our fellow citizens."
"We wanted to change the way of drawing up a text, a treaty and then, finally, a Constitution."
"Today we have to recognise that, although the Constitution has some excellent qualities, it did not quite meet those expectations or make those innovations."
"The first conclusion I would like to draw is that the democratic debate that has been started in Europe and that has opened up because of this sort of crisis, the importance of which should not now be exaggerated, must, at all events, continue."
"Once again, whether or not we call for a postponement and that is an important question that I shall refer to the President of the European Council when I speak to him on your behalf to convey the different attitudes and the different analyses that you have expressed in your debate – reflection must not be restricted only to chancelleries."
"This will not provide a way out of the present crisis."
"Whether there is a postponement or not, we must, above all, avoid adding confusion to the current uncertainty, and that uncertainty is very real."
"We must make clear decisions, we must tell the people, with the people, what are the ways out we have open to us and what we think is best."
"I agree that we have to recognise that it is up to each sovereign nation – and, as I am from Luxembourg, I feel directly involved, since our referendum will be taking place very soon, on 10 July – to decide, if it wishes, immediately and without waiting, to carry on as if nothing had happened."
"That is an option, and maybe that is the way we should continue."
"Be that as it may, if we do take a decision, we must take it with clarity and not in confusion."
"The democratic debate must be extended to our countries and to our Parliaments."
"It must be carried on with the very lifeblood of our countries and with the unions and management."
"We have to make up for the time that has been wasted for so long."
"There must be a European debate in tune with the debates at national level because that is the only means of emerging greater and stronger from this challenge."
"I know of no magic formula. I am completely in agreement with the President of the Commission when he says that we need to find a new political consensus, here, in this Parliament above all, but also in our Member States."
"Europe must be an issue, but it must also be the subject of a basic consensus between all democrats and between all those who believe that Europe is the solution and not the problem."
"We must first reach agreement on the essentials and then open up the political debate, whatever its tendency, move it forward and carry it through to a conclusion."
"I believe, Mr President, that when you go to the European Council you will be listened to because you have conducted a very useful debate."
"I believe that your message will serve to clarify the thinking of those who have to make a decision next week."
"Thank you again. You may not have provided a solution yet, but you have, perhaps, shown the way towards a solution."
"Mr President, I too should like, first of all, to congratulate Parliament."
"I believe that we have indeed had a serious debate."
"I recognised that, although we started from different viewpoints, a genuine intellectual effort was nonetheless made to recognise that there is a problem and to analyse it seriously and responsibly."
"At the close of this debate, however, it is equally clear that there is no magic solution and that all of us recognise the very great complexity of the problem."
"The situation may be complex and may be difficult, but we have no choice but to accept a truth, handed down to us through political science from antiquity, and that is caution."
"I know that, today, we live in a society where, because of media coverage, we are at the mercy of the constant demand for news and urgency. However, we are responsible political men and women and we need to show caution."
"That too is a great political virtue. That is why we must, perhaps, give ourselves the time and the conditions for a proper analysis, an in-depth analysis, and for a proper debate and a collective solution."
"Nonetheless, I think it is possible to draw some conclusions from today’s debate."
"It was clear to me, and this has been reinforced by the conclusions drawn by the President-in-Office of the Council, that a favourable reception was given to the idea of a more intensive dialogue, both within the European context and within the national context, a dialogue that goes even beyond the political institutions."
"If we can agree on this principle, the idea that Europe does not utterly disregard the negative results in two countries as important as France and the Netherlands, that Europe listens and that institutions and politicians listen and want to understand what is happening and to come up with solutions is an important one."
"I think that, on this point, there has been, all things considered, fairly general agreement in favour of this idea."
"I think I can say that there was also agreement in favour, too, of recognising the responsibility shared by all those involved and the need to work together in order to find a new consensus that will allow Europe to move forward."
"There is a third idea which, I believe, is more or less generally accepted, and that is the idea that we must avoid paralysis."
"We have an institutional problem."
"Certainly, no one spoke in favour of paralysing the European project, no one said that now, because of what has happened, Europe was going to come to a stop and was not going to continue with the programmes that are in the interests of the people who are our citizens: programmes for growth, employment, security and the fight against crime."
"We have to move forward."
"The people expect definite answers, beyond institutional debate and constitutional discussions."
"If one accepts that, if one accepts the idea of a refusal to paralyse Europe, if one accepts the idea of a genuine European debate, the idea of recognition of our shared responsibility with a view to a new consensus in Europe, one is entitled to expect the European Council to be able to find this new dynamic consensus, along with a strengthened resolve to advance our common cause. Independently, however, of the new vision for Europe that we need, we must also find specific answers for specific problems."
"What, then, is the first real problem that we face?"
"It is the European budget, the need to find a consensus, in a spirit of compromise, on the financial perspective."
"I believe that would be a very powerful signal for the European Council to send to all Europeans, the signal that Europe goes on."
"Of course, there are difficulties, but we are, I repeat, capable of overcoming those difficulties."
"The debate is closed."
"– The mask has slipped!"
"Following the victories of the no campaigns in the French and Dutch referenda on the so-called ‘European Constitution’, it has become clear that for the political forces still running the EU in a brotherhood – the Right and the ‘socialists’ – and for the interests that they represent – the large economic and financial groups – the referenda have only taken place so that the people can say yes to what suits those forces and interests."
"There is a great deal of confusion among the rank and file."
"Some want to continue the ‘ratification’ process in order ultimately to impose fresh referenda on those insolent citizens (until they say yes), whilst others facing referenda and expecting no votes – and solely for this reason – want firstly to know how to avoid the same fate as the French and Dutch votes."
"In other words, nobody wants this hot potato, until such time as a magic formula has been discovered to save the ‘European Constitution’, be it revamped or otherwise."
"This will take time."
"In Portugal, the Socialist party, the Social Democrat Party and the Coalition, despite having been overtaken by events, are still pressing ahead with holding a farcical referendum on the so-called ‘European Constitution’, which has twice been rejected, on the same day as municipal elections, which will stifle any chance of open and meaningful debate."
"There is therefore only one appropriate course of action: to bury the ‘European Constitution’ once and for all."
"I would like to welcome Mr Voronin, President of the Republic of Moldova, and the delegation accompanying him."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, when Romania joins the European Union, Moldova will become a direct neighbour of our Union."
"The Union, therefore, Mr President, is working actively to strengthen relations with Moldova, as I have said before."
"The action plan between the European Union and Moldova that we have recently implemented is a good instrument for moving these relations forward."
"Mr President, I wish you a fruitful visit to our Institution"
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had ..."
"Mr Bonde, I have cut you off because this is not the time to make statements."
"If you have a point of order, please tell me which Rule you are invoking."
"Mr President, on a point of order, it is Article 100 of the Rules of Procedure, on interpretation of the rules."
"Are you invoking Rule 100 on interpretation of the Rules of Procedure?"
"Please wait a moment."
"Mr President, there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure ..."
"Mr Bonde, you do not have the right to speak under Rule 100."
"It does not refer to any point of order."
"Mr President, this concerns the way in which we interpret the Rules of Procedure."
"I arranged with the Secretary-General to have a one-minute explanation."
"That is normally enough for a group leader."
"Alright, Mr Bonde, explain to me the problem you have with Rule 100."
"Mr President, the problem is that there are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 25 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EUR 10 million in regional aid to his friend."
"Moreover, we wrote in our motion of censure that we would withdraw said motion if we were given a reasonable explanation."
"We were given an explanation, but Parliament’s President has in the meantime decided that, contrary to the wish expressed in the motion itself, we must vote on the motion."
"We are satisfied that, in future, motions of censure are to be accepted from the moment they are submitted with 74 signatures, whereupon they will automatically be put to the vote, but the motion was submitted under the old rules, and some of us will therefore choose to abstain from voting when the motion is put to the vote."
"That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commission’s answer, but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate, and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts ..."
"Thank you, Mr Bonde."
"I note that that is in no way a point of order. Please sit down."
"Please do not indulge in parliamentary filibustering."
"What you are raising is in no sense a point of order."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the vote in the temporary committee on 10 May, we had around 620 amendments to deal with and vote on."
"On the basis of the 620 amendments in the temporary committee, I had tabled 44 compromise amendments to the committee, of which 41 were adopted."
"I should like to ask you to take account of the following when you vote: because of the vote, there are three technical corrections that need to be made to ensure that the text and the table of figures are consistent."
"Technical corrections need to be made to the figures in paragraph 50, indents seven and nine."
"In the seventh indent, the figure of EUR 4.5 billion should be replaced by the figure EUR 4.7 billion."
"The figure of EUR 2.5 billion in the seventh indent should be replaced by the figure of EUR 2.7 billion."
"In the ninth indent – and this is a further technical correction that is required – the figure of EUR 1.5 billion should be replaced by the figure of EUR 1.2 billion."
"These are the technical corrections required to ensure that the text and table are consistent."
"Then I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 6 to paragraph 31."
"If the second part of Amendment 6 is adopted, I would ask you to accept it as an addition to paragraph 31."
"This is the part of the amendment that reads, ‘considers that allocation of funding should fall under the ‘normal’ EU budget and thus under the discharge authority of the EP’."
"That is all on this amendment."
"Thirdly, having held further talks just now, I should like to ask my group, contrary to the voting list, to support Amendment 19 to paragraph 50, second indent, tabled by the Socialist Group."
"This is after all only a slight nuance, which does not change my intention as rapporteur."
"We take note of your comments, which will of course be incorporated into the text being put to the vote."
"Please allow me to make a few brief comments on the importance of this Parliament’s vote on this resolution."
"We are all aware that over the coming days the European institutions have the serious responsibility to reach an agreement on the Union's priorities for the coming years and to provide the financial resources necessary for them."
"Parliament has established its position, which we have just voted for by a large majority."
"During our debate yesterday, President Barroso told us that, despite certain differences, he is comfortable with Parliament's proposal, because what we have just voted for and what the Commission is proposing are not so different."
"I believe that the Member States must do whatever they can to reach an agreement on 16 and 17 June, and I believe that we can trust in the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Minister Schmit has taken the view that Parliament's approach is realistic and consistent."
"I believe that we are in a position to call upon the Council also to demonstrate realism, ambition and consistency so that the European Union can continue to operate."
"Finally, everybody should be aware that if there were no financial perspectives, the Union would operate on the basis of the annual budgetary procedure laid down in Article 272 of the current Treaty, which provides Parliament with very significant room for manoeuvre."
"Parliament would use it, but since that would lead to conflicts we do not want to see between the two arms of the budgetary authority, we would once again urge the Council to reach an agreement Parliament can accept."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the referenda in the two countries that have just said no to the Constitutional Treaty, a more democratic strategy seems necessary."
"It is time to prove it, in the matter currently concerning us."
"First of all, I shall ask that the Council be invited, as proposed in paragraph 4 of the resolution, to indicate the positions of the national delegations, duly named, within the framework of the legislative process, instead of keeping them secret, including from the European Parliament’s rapporteur, and this with the peculiar notion of protecting the effectiveness of the Institution’s decision-making process."
"Secondly, the text seeks to make the debates of the Council public, when it is acting in a legislative capacity, and this would enable us, in particular, to know what it thinks of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"For example, I gather that the opinion of the European Parliament concerning the framework decision on racism, which dates from 2002, that is to say from three years ago, has still not been examined – or, at least, it had not been last week – by the ‘Justice’ Council."
"Thirdly, as indicated in paragraphs five and six of this resolution, the text seeks to include the European Parliament when the European Union concludes international agreements, since these agreements are not even referred to the national parliaments."
"Finally, I would point out that the European Parliament has already asked, during the preceding session, to be included, within the framework of the codecision procedure, in the creation of the future Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"Finally, we can only deplore the disastrous financial perspective for this area."
"As the rapporteur and on behalf of the committee that it is my honour to chair, I call upon the President of the European Parliament to submit these demands to the next European Council and to the future British Presidency."
"When the new Commission was appointed, we had asked for a review of the regulations concerning transparency."
"We were told that it was too soon."
"I can only conclude, in the light of the international ballots, that it is perhaps too late."
"Someone has to take responsibility for that."
"Thank you, Mr Cavada."
"Your requests will be duly dealt with by the Presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are two reports left: the Gaubert report and the Bowis report."
"It is 1.15 p.m."
"If you are in agreement, and only if you are in agreement, we could postpone the vote on these two reports until tomorrow."
"If those Members of the European Parliament who are members of the did not take part in the vote on the motion of censure, it was not because of political sympathy with the Commission but because the motion was ill presented and ill conceived."
"We would have been quite prepared to censure Mr Barroso for his political actions and, in particular, for the obstinacy that allows the Commission to disregard the very clear vote expressed recently both by the French people and the Dutch people."
"When, however, one calls into question a person’s worthiness, one has to be sure of where one stands and one has to be prepared to see matters through."
"Mr Bonde’s tacit withdrawal of his motion of censure, just before it was voted on, shows that he was in no such position."
"Consequently, we feared that hastiness might undermine the motion of censure, which has to be reserved only for the very serious circumstances for which my group has decided to use it in future."
"There are 90 of us who, as MEPs, have signed a motion of censure on the Commission, because it was the only way we had of getting the President of the Commission to come here to Parliament and explain the connection between a gift of a holiday worth between EUR 20 000 and EUR 25 000 and a subsequent decision to provide EUR 10 million in regional aid to his friend Spyros Latsis, 54th on the list of the world’s richest people."
"We wrote in our motion of censure that we would withdraw said motion if we were given a reasonable explanation."
"We were given an explanation, but Parliament’s President has in the meantime decided that, contrary to our wishes, we must vote on the motion."
"We are satisfied that, in future, motions of censure are to be accepted from the moment they are submitted with 74 signatures, whereupon they shall automatically be put to the vote."
"The motion was submitted under the old rules, however."
"Some of us will therefore choose to abstain from voting when the motion is put to the vote."
"That does not mean that we are satisfied with the Commission’s answer, but we are pleased about the undertakings given during the debate, and we shall pursue the matter in the Committee on Budgetary Control and go on fighting for complete openness about gifts and about membership of the Commission’s 3 000 secret working parties."
"Today's vote on the Motion of Censure was a farce."
"The Parliament voted, with a massive majority, to pat Mr Barroso on the back and tell him what a splendid job he is doing."
"It tells him and the other Commissioners that they can accept any amount of hospitality, from anyone, without there being any question of being held to account."
"The Motion was called only because of Barroso's refusal to come clean over hospitality, and the intransigence and blind obedience of the major political groups."
"Well, despite the strong arm tactics and bullying we managed to have a debate, which is a small victory for transparency."
"The silence of Mr. Barroso, on the very central and direct question on the Latsis Group and the EU relations, no doubt proves there are no longer business links between them."
"However due to a re-interpretation of the rules we are forced into today's vote which was never our intention."
"So be it."
"The European Parliament may have confidence in Mr Barroso, but other recent votes out there in the real world suggest that the peoples of Europe have lost confidence in his project."
"As a signatory of the Motion of Censure, my intention, as declared in the Motion, was to ensure that Commission President José Manuel Barroso should come to the parliament to explain the lavish hospitality which he had received from a Greek shipping magnate. This objective was achieved, and like most signatories I should then have been very happy for the Motion to be withdrawn."
"Apparently this was not possible for procedural reasons."
"Since I did not wish the Motion to be voted at all, it seemed that my most logical course of action would be to abstain on the vote."
".Governmental officials are required to keep their hands clean, whether they are employed by the European Union or by local communities."
"They have to avoid conflicts of interest such as personally rewarding links with companies."
"In Mr Barroso's case, being the President of the European Commission, doubts about such corporate links have arisen."
"Therefore we signed a motion of censure with the explicit and exclusive goal to initiate a debate in the plenary session."
"Although this debate has already taken place on the 25th of May, we have no reasons to be satisfied with Mr Barroso's replies yet."
"We strongly believe that a majority of MEPs indeed has made it too easy for Mr Barroso to take the criticism seriously."
"In the meantime we have received fresh information about Mr Barroso's corporate involvement."
"Although this information has been insufficient yet for bringing this motion of censure to the vote, it might as well become sufficient later."
"If we would have had the freedom to withdraw or postpone the motion of censure, we would have done so."
"As it seems, though, that it is no longer possible to withdraw this motion, we have decided to abstain from voting today."
". I am unable to vote in favour of the Motion of Censure before us."
"The Commission and its President have been involved in very important work in the context of the debate on the Financial Perspective. Consequently, the purpose of this attack on him, which is devoid of any ethical basis, is simply to undermine a Community institution."
"Those responsible have an outlook that errs not by going against the grain but by simply being against, without bringing any positive proposal to the table."
"Ethical requirements go hand in hand with a responsible attitude, which is clearly not the case with this Motion of Censure."
"The reason I voted in favour of the Böge report was because I believe it is necessary to demonstrate the EU’s ability to take action through its institutions after the failed referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"As an equal to the Council, Parliament clearly formulated its political priorities in relation to the Financial Perspective."
"Thanks to the rapporteur, a framework has been created with the utmost professionalism which provides real added value, and which sets out feasible and acceptable financial thresholds that will eventually be transformed into specific tools and programmes."
"The fact that cohesion funding will be maintained at 4% of GDP is of great importance for the new Member States, as they stand to receive a substantial amount of funding for cohesion and structural measures."
"At the same time, emphasis is laid on a fairer distribution of contributions by net payers, in keeping with the spirit of solidarity."
"The Böge report represents an acceptable compromise between the generous proposal by the Commission and the inadequate proposal by the Council."
"The challenge that the Council faces is to enable negotiations on the Financial Perspective to be concluded while Luxembourg still holds the presidency, and at any rate no later than by the end of this year, by means of its unanimous approval at the June summit."
"Mr President, in relation to the Böge report I speak on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group: Mrs Doyle, Mr Mitchell, Mr Coveney and Mr Higgins."
"We congratulate Mr Böge on his report and we are happy with its broad thrust."
"However, I have to register our concerns about the financing of agriculture."
"We voted with our Spanish colleagues, so the onus is on the Council and not the Member States to meet any shortfall that arises."
"In the light of a recent reform of the common agricultural policy, the current position of Parliament, which would suggest cofinancing, will not be viewed very well by our farmers and rural dwellers."
"I believe that it sends out the wrong signal, at a time when public confidence in Europe is suffering, and that the common agricultural policy is damaged by any mention of cofinancing."
"We have therefore voted to that effect."
"I am pleased with the position adopted by the European Parliament on the financial perspectives and I now only hope that the Council will do its duty and reach an agreement on the 17th."
"But several of us have abstained on a matter of principle, and that is that we do not accept –– not even hypothetically –– any reopening of the 2002 agreement on the common agricultural policy."
"We want it to remain closed until 2013, as has been agreed."
". In light of:"
"1. the political context and the need to involve the various European partners in building a stable financial framework that will ensure sustainable development and job creation;"
"2. the need for the European institutions to give a clear sign that they are committed to seeking solutions to the citizens’ problems;"
"3. the need to channel efforts into reaching an agreement with which most of Europe’s 453 million citizens can identify, thereby ensuring unity in diversity;"
"4. the fact that cohesion policy represents the EU’s internal solidarity and that, despite current limitations, this principle has at least been upheld;"
"the Portuguese Socialists in Parliament voted in favour of the Böge report on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013."
"Tough prioritising of the European Union’s resources is crucially important to bringing about the changes needed by Europe."
"Issues concerned with enlargement and with forging close links between EU countries need to be given priority, as well as the fight against crime and the work on making the EU into the world’s most competitive economy."
"Aid for the weakest regions must be given priority, as must the ambition substantially to increase the EU’s research budget."
"Priority must also be given to the role of the EU in relation to the climate issue and to fighting poverty and infectious diseases."
"We do not accept an increase in administrative costs of 3% per year."
"Low taxes on work and enterprise are one precondition for turning Europe into a successful economy."
"These require room for manoeuvre in the Member States’ financial policy."
"We therefore believe that the levels of commitments and payments adopted by the European Parliament are too high."
"In order to reduce the EU’s budget, we wish to revise the agreement from 2002 concerning agricultural expenditure and to carry out an overhaul of regional aid, with priority instead being given to the poorest regions."
"For these reasons, we have abstained in the final vote, rather than voted against Parliament’s proposal, significant parts of which we are able to support. We cannot, however, give our support to the unduly high level of expenditure, especially as the way in which it would be distributed would not coincide with our priorities."
"Mr Böge’s report represents Parliament’s mandate for negotiation with a view to the next financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"I voted against this report for the following reasons."
"1."
"The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty showed that some of the nations of Europe had doubts about the effectiveness of European socio-economic policies."
"I am convinced that the European Union has to have an ambitious budget that gives to the Community’s authorities the means of carrying out their task."
"The Böge report, which fixes the payment appropriations at 1.7% of the Gross National Income, does not measure up to this challenge."
"2."
"The emphasis on budgetary restraint undermines the European commitment towards farmers."
"It also threatens the viability of the common market organisation (CMO) for sugar, the reform of which it will not be possible to finance."
"I do not accept that farmers should become the victims of national self-interest, implicit in the Böge report."
"3."
"The introduction of joint financing, which opens the way to renationalisation of the common agricultural policy (CAP), is, in my opinion, unacceptable."
"It signals a departure from the only public policy that is genuinely European, at a moment in our history when Europe needs to become stronger by sharing its strengths."
"Giving in to national misgivings would further widen the gap between Europe and its nations."
"Mr Wohlin’s written reservation concerning Mr Böge’s report, together with Mrs Goudin’s speech in Parliament on 7 June 2005, helpfully sum up why the June List has chosen to vote against this report."
"We support the Swedish Government’s and the other five countries’ demand that the EU’s budget should not exceed 1.00% of gross national income, be it in payments or commitments."
"The EU must fulfil its commitments towards the ten new Member States, but room is made for this expenditure within the present expenditure framework."
"The difference between our demand for 1.00% and the European Parliament’s (and the Commission’s) proposal lies in the fact that the EU-15 (with the exceptions of Greece and Portugal) have, in particular, to forgo aid from the Cohesion Fund."
"The June List welcomes the initiative in terms of cofinancing and hopes that this will open the way to future renationalisation of, for example, agricultural policy."
"We also support the idea of a correction mechanism to compensate those countries that, under the present system, account for a disproportionately large proportion of the EU’s income."
"The correction mechanism will hopefully also be an alternative to the British rebate."
"By rejecting the Constitution, both France and the Netherlands have shown that they prefer less, rather than more, supranationalism."
"A Swedish veto in the Council against a bad compromise is a better alternative than a new long-term budget."
"A vote against this report is an emphatic vote in favour of increased subsidiarity."
". We say no to the proposals tabled by the Commission and Parliament on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, firstly because, politically and financially, they reflect the objectives enshrined in the so-called ‘European Constitution’, such as the primacy of competition, the reinforcement of ‘fortress Europe’ and the militarisation of the EU; and, secondly, because they are woefully inadequate in financial terms if we want to foster ‘social and economic cohesion’ and to meet the social, economic and environmental challenges of the enlarged EU."
"We say no because we are opposed to any move to help the most economically developed countries – or rather their large economic and financial groups – to derive, once again, the lion’s share of the political and economic benefit from the EU, serving their interests ahead of the interests of Portugal and the Portuguese people."
"We say no because what we need is to make a clean break from the EU’s neoliberal policies and, on the basis of cooperation between equal sovereign States, to foster sustainable economic development, create jobs and combat persistently high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality."
"We therefore reject the report by Mr Böge. Instead we advocate the alternative resolution tabled by our Group on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, containing proposals that defend Portugal’s interests."
". Explanations of vote."
"We voted against Amendment 26 because its wording implies that the EU's Northern Dimension should be reformulated as the Baltic Strategy."
"We are in favour of the creation of a Baltic Strategy for the European Union, but it should be part of the Northern Dimension."
"We would have liked those who tabled the amendment to agree to an oral amendment, which would have clearly highlighted the importance of the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Strategy as a vital part of it."
". Natura 2000 finds that it has no budget!"
"The major omission from the financial perspective is, once again, nature conservation."
"In the course of numerous debates, however, each Member of the European Parliament acknowledged that Natura 2000 was an integral part of European Union policy, that the first experiments in managing sites had produced very positive results and, better still, they had made it possible to lay the foundations for sustainable development in areas of important biological value."
"The environment, having previously been kept in check, was turning out to be the trump card for new development based on a realisation of the importance of the natural heritage of our countries."
"The report mentions the EUR 21 billion needed to continue to run Natura 2000 for 2007-2013 but there was not a single line of the budget that referred to this figure in the forecasts of expenditure."
"An amendment adopted in plenary even managed to remove Natura 2000 from the funding for fishing."
"This indicates that there is no policy in a position to contribute to the setting up of Natura 2000."
"Does this mean that Natura 2000 will be nipped in the bud by the financial perspective?"
"The only remaining hope for nature conservation now rests with the LIFE+ fund."
"The European Parliament will need to redeem itself by including a share for Natura 2000 in this financial instrument for the environment."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against this report because it falls short of proposing the financial reform that is necessary in order for the EU taxpayer to receive better value for money."
"Now is not the time to ask for more money from Member States when the public perceives the EU budget as a 'black hole'."
"Instead, the EU should do less but do it better."
"Consequently, we support actually capping the EU budget contributions by Member States to 1% Gross National Income."
"The EU must manage the funding it receives in a more transparent and cost-effective manner, targeted towards stimulating economic growth and prosperity across Europe."
"Finally, the British Government be allowed to abandon the UK rebate for any short-term alternatives."
"Currently, the UK receives receipts per capita that are probably the lowest in the EU, receiving less, in terms of infrastructure and agricultural subsidies, than states such as France and Italy."
"Indeed, Britain is already the second largest contributor to the budget and without the rebate, it would make us the largest."
"Hardly an example of giving value for money to the British taxpayer!"
"."
"It is because there is more to agriculture than the production of food that its maintenance in all the Member States is an important task for the European Union."
"Economic and rural development benefit from it, and a healthy natural and cultural landscape is guaranteed."
"Farmers must continue to be guaranteed financial support through the common agricultural policy, and the EU’s long-term financial planning must reflect this."
"The accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for 2007, will make the financial situation more acute."
"No provision is as yet being made for more funding to be allocated to the CAP in order to take account of this enlargement; on the contrary, the draft envisages a reduction in, or capping of, resources."
"The accession would further reduce the funds set aside for farmers in the existing Member States, and so, should the CAP’s financial resources prove insufficient to meet the need, contributions would have to be sought from the individual Member States, which would be obliged to find the shortfall for their own farmers."
"Far from adding up to the renationalisation of agricultural policy, this would mean that its funding would be secure in the long term."
"If the benefits of the common agricultural policy are to be retained, it may in future be necessary to ask the Member States to bear their share of the costs, for it is not acceptable that farmers should foot the bill for the European Union’s enlargement, and that funds for other policies should be quarried from the agricultural budget."
"I am abstaining from voting on this report for the following reasons."
"- I am in favour of a stronger, more political Europe."
"It is difficult for the European Parliament to put forward a figure for the general budget that is below that proposed by the Commission."
"It is difficult to want more Europe without an adequate budget."
"I feel it necessary, therefore, to give some pointers to the Heads of State or Government who will make the final decision on the level of the financial perspective."
"They must give to Europe the means of achieving its goals"
"- Joint financing of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rejected."
"It introduces ideas that could prove destructive to one of the founding policies of the European Union and moves it towards renationalisation."
"It does nothing at all for the European credit deficit. Instead it transfers responsibility for part of the cost onto the Member States and/or their territorial communities without ensuring that they actually have the means to pay."
"It is a false solution for those who refuse to take decisions in favour of a better distribution of public support for agriculture and for a more in-depth review of the CAP that would lead to more sustainable agriculture."
". As members of the Dutch Socialist Party, we have no fundamental objections to the possibility of the European Union having the maximum of 1.26% of the gross national product, as laid down in the treaties, at its disposal."
"Money spent collectively on democracy, the environment, the provision of public services, social security and international solidarity is money well spent."
"A society that omits to set aside resources for this purpose is permanently in crisis."
"Although we have no sympathy whatsoever with those who want to reduce taxes by rolling back the state, we are critical of the EU on account of the way it spends money, which is sluiced around unnecessarily to regions in the richest Member States, with much of the agricultural funds ending up with the big farmers and in export subsidies, and the disaster fund suddenly being extended to include a terrorism fund."
"The European Parliament costs a great deal of money unnecessarily, with vast amounts being reimbursed in expenses and on account of its permanent commuting between two cities."
"Many of the cross-border issues for which the EU could be useful are not tackled, and many of the funds disappear into shadowy spending and fraud. As long as this situation persists, we have little reason to actively oppose those who want to reduce spending to 1%, even if we condemn their often selfish views and arguments."
".– It is an insult to debate the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, when their declared aim is to implement the new Constitutional Treaty which has been rejected, condemned and is dead."
"The peoples of France and the Netherlands condemned on the basis of their experience of life the European and government policy which brings austerity, unemployment, inflation and uncertainty through capitalist restructurings as promoted in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013."
"This is the direction they are taking, in order to safeguard the profits of and reinforce European capital and the plutocracy in each country, strike at grass-roots rights and reinforce the militarisation of the ΕU and, of course, there are numerous appropriations for propaganda and for diverting the workers from their real interests."
"Infighting between the imperialists is worsening and the margins for manoeuvre are narrowing and the rejection of the 'European Constitution' is a good and optimistic message."
"The positive outcome of these referenda for the peoples of the ΕU, which – and this is your pseudo-democracy – you disdain in your stand, cannot be reversed by a decision on the financial perspectives which the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against."
"However, it does show the workers the path of insubordination and disobedience to the policy of the ΕU and opens up prospects for the fight for a Europe of peace, grass-roots rights and socialism."
". I would like it to be noted that I am in favour of retaining the British rebate."
"This should be the case until there is a radical reduction in the amount of money that is paid to agriculture."
". I abstained from voting on the report before us, because I feel that what it proposes is somewhere between what I advocate (the Commission’s proposal) and a position that could not be further from mine (the 1% of GDP option)."
"Given that the proposal in this report has moved away from the Commission’s position (both the Prodi Commission and the current one), and would lead to an unjustified and unacceptable reduction in overall amounts, I am unable to vote in favour."
"Nor can I vote against the report, however, because what it proposes is more favourable than what the Presidency of the Council had proposed – according to what is in the public domain – and certainly more than what the six largest contributors to the Community budget are proposing, namely to reduce the Union Budget to 1% of Community GDP."
"My vote should therefore be seen as a vote in favour of continuing talks so that the EU’s obligations on cohesion and solidarity can be met, and so that the financial needs arising from the enlargement and from a broader range of powers can be met, without that resulting in directing losses for the other budget headings, such as the Structural Funds allocations."
".– Restore confidence, make Europe into something better, not bigger – this is one of the key messages the majority of citizens of France and the Netherlands delivered to their leaders last week."
"This is also one of our priority tasks: to redefine our project and our very identity, and to make better use of the resources we want to devote to it."
"People are saying today that the double ‘NO’ has revived the chances for governments to agree on the financial perspective, as it is so obviously urgent to restore confidence and strengthen the European project."
"And I wonder if this perspective is really such good news for those who, like me, want an ambitious budget to make tomorrow’s Europe a successful one."
"How can we hope to achieve our ambitions in terms of research and development, the environment, employment and the protection of backward regions, how can we succeed with enlargement if the ‘club of 6 skinflints’ does not allow some concessions?"
"A Europe of 25 Members cannot succeed with less money than when it only had 15!"
"Since the two referenda took place, promises have come thick and fast: a better Europe, a relaunched, pro-employment Europe, and so on."
"These are merely gratuitous promises if not backed up by the budget."
"This is why I voted in favour of the Böge report – a report full of ambition both in its figures and in its aims."
". I voted against Amendment 3 because the Lisbon strategy was originally based on a tripod of social, environmental and economic issues."
"In its review both the social and environment legs of the Lisbon Strategy have been demoted in favour of an EU brand of competitiveness."
"This is a recipe for social and economic stagnation and environmental disaster."
"I voted against Amendment 28 because it would allow the EU to backtrack on commitments of support to farmers by forcing countries to co-finance schemes such as the Single Farm Payment."
"Irish farmers are already struggling to survive in an economic climate that has been made artificially difficult."
"It would only increase our farmers’ difficulty."
". I voted in favour of this report because I agree with its objectives and am confident that the proposed solutions are workable."
"It is nowadays widely accepted that combating money laundering – the crime of real criminals – is one of the best ways of tackling large-scale organised crime, be it terrorism or otherwise, given that it is one of the most serious attacks on the democratic rule of law."
"Against this backdrop, I endorse the objectives tabled in the report before us."
"I believe that interinstitutional cooperation has, moreover, resulted in a solution that is reasonable, balanced and potentially workable."
"Current rules on excise duty are sometimes unclear and difficult to apply."
"They lead to unnecessary additional work for private individuals and companies."
"We therefore welcome the Commission’s overhaul of the rules governing products subject to excise duty."
"At the same time, we are critical of quite a few of the Commission’s proposed solutions."
"We therefore chose today to vote against the European Parliament’s legislative resolution which, to a large degree, also supported the worse parts of the Commission’s proposal."
"We believe that only those products transported by private individuals themselves should be regarded as private imports and thus be exempted from taxation in their own countries."
"It must be possible for both tobacco and alcohol to be exempted from the general rule that excise duty must be paid in that Member State in which products acquired for private use are consumed."
"The reason for our attitude is that tobacco and alcohol are damaging to public health and should not therefore be treated like any old products."
"We also object to its becoming possible for private individuals themselves to transport large volumes of mineral oils."
"We believe that it should be possible to have separate excise duties on products that damage our environment."
"In that way, it will be possible to direct people’s choices so that these are environmentally more friendly."
"What is more, transport and modes of transport are safer for being managed professionally."
"Current rules on excise duty are sometimes unclear and difficult to apply."
"They lead to unnecessary additional work for private individuals and companies."
"We therefore welcome the Commission’s overhaul of the rules governing products subject to excise duty."

"In that way, it will be possible to direct people’s choices so that these are environmentally more friendly."
"What is more, transport and modes of transport are safer for being managed professionally."
"For public health reasons, I have chosen today not to support Mr Rosati’s report on amending the directive on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty, such as alcohol and tobacco."
"Neither the Commission’s proposal nor the European Parliament’s report safeguard public health to the degree I believe is desirable."
"Rightly used, and in conjunction with other measures, indicative guide levels can play an important role in establishing whether products are held for commercial purposes or for the personal use of private individuals."
"With a view to limiting the harmful effects of alcohol and working to reduce total alcohol consumption, I believe that the guide levels should remain."
"Special efforts should also be made to harmonise excise duty levels with the express objective of reducing the harm caused by tobacco and alcohol."
"Through this proposal, both the Commission and the European Parliament wish in practice to remove the opportunities that exist for importing limited quotas of alcohol and tobacco."
"The June List therefore chooses to abstain from voting on the committee’s amendments because a ‘no’ vote would entail support for the Commission’s proposal."
"The Swedish, Finnish and Danish Governments instead want the indicative levels to be halved and regarded as upper limits for private imports."
"The June List thus supports the Swedish, Finnish and Danish position in the Council."
"Fortunately, the area concerned is one in which Sweden still has a veto in the Council, so this proposal should not be a threat to the existing legislation."
". Although I appreciate the concerns raised by the issue at hand, especially as it concerns an issue as sensitive as taxation, on this particular aspect I am in favour of a more liberalising solution, one that makes an effective contribution towards establishing the internal market."
"This is especially true inasmuch as the issue at stake here is consumer activities rather than business activities, as has been clearly stated."
". May I inform the President that the E.P.L.P voted to abstain in the final vote of the above report."
"The E.P.L.P believes that although a single market for products purchased by individuals is essential, other issues affect decisions over excise duty charges."
"Moreover, this report on distance purchasing ignores the related concept of e-commerce."
"Secondly, Member States should be allowed to set excise duty rates themselves."
"Maximum harmonisation infringes this right."
"Thirdly, minimum indicative levels act as a reasonable guide in the UK for personal consumption and help the UK authorities to fight fraud."
". We are about to embark on the second stage of implementing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In meeting the citizens’ concerns for more freedom and more security, a legal, and more importantly, political and institutional, balance must be struck."
"This is with particular regard to three crucial questions:"
"- credibility: I am aware of the difficulties and delays that have come to light in a number of areas."
"This demonstrates that there is much to do in order to raise the level of trust among the Member States."
"I do not agree, however, that the best course of action is to develop initiatives outside the Community framework, such as Schengen+ (between seven Member States), which undermine the development of mutual trust among the Member States."
"- legitimacy: The low levels of democratic legitimacy are appalling."
"Parliament must be genuinely involved in drawing up legislation."
"- effectiveness: Objectives, priorities and responsibilities must be clearly set out, whilst ensuring that efforts are not duplicated and not spread too thinly."
"Lastly, maintaining current legislation in the expectation that the Constitutional Treaty would be ratified has served to exacerbate the existing democratic shortfall."
"There are a number of aspects that should have, but have not, been addressed, such as the democratic supervision of Europol and Eurojust."
"The June List believes that police cooperation and legal cooperation should be intergovernmental, that criminal law should not be harmonised at EU level and that no European Prosecutor’s Office should be set up."
"Immigration and asylum policy must go on being conducted at national level in order to avoid creating a Fortress Europe."
"Moreover, the Member States themselves should determine how their democratic institutions are to be designed, taking account of the Copenhagen criteria and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"We cannot, therefore, support the resolution."
". In order for a large, open area without borders, characterised by freedom of movement, to become a reality, there must be strong cooperation and trust among the various Member States, and among the political authorities, the police authorities and indeed the legal authorities."
"I do not believe that every proposal in the report before us is essential, necessary, useful or desirable."
"I voted in favour, however, because I feel that at the heart of this report is the conviction and the awareness that without cooperation, without trust and without a certain Community element in certain areas of internal policy, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives of the area of freedom, justice and security, especially as regards preventing and combating crime and terrorism, which is one of its most significant aspects."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the resolution on an area of freedom, security and justice."
"We are, however, aware of the fact that parts of the resolution concern an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and do not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark’s position."
"Mr President, the Moraes report is yet another of those documents that are full of good intentions, yet invariably achieving the opposite of what they actually hope to achieve, with constant talk of racism and discrimination, although those terms are not precisely defined."
"It does, of course, become a problem when these terms occur in repressive legislation, which is what is being recommended here."
"That is how Belgium’s largest political party came to be condemned partly on the basis of a text on female circumcision."
"According to the judge, that text was not published to improve the situation of women in Islam, but to stigmatise Islam."
"In that way, freedom of opinion is crippled and problems become unmentionable, which is not, of course, the way to get them solved."
"The report speaks, and I quote, in terms of ‘profoundly racist, anti-Semitic, islamophobic and homophobic statements and actions by prominent politicians and members of government’."
"The reality is, however, that nearly all anti-Semitic incidents can be traced back to Islamic immigrants."
"The reality is that so-called discrimination is often the result of a lack of willingness to integrate on the part of immigrants."
"The reality is that the indigenous population has never been consulted democratically about the question whether they want to live in a multi-cultural country, and that is something that must change as a matter of urgency."
". I voted against the Moraes report because of the unacceptability to me of Paragraphs 22 and 24."
"I cannot accept the promotion of equal matrimonial and other rights for same sex couples."
"I believe a Member State has the right to reject such partnerships as not equal to heterosexual relationships."
"I strongly support the family unit being based on the natural order of complementary sex couples and I value the benefit to children which results."
". Some of the provisions setting out the rights of sexual minorities in the final version of the Moraes report on the protection of minorities are inherently risky. The reason for this is that the overly broad concepts used in the report could result in too wide an interpretation of these rights."
"The wording of paragraph 24, which calls on the Commission to eliminate obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples, could serve as a basis for the recognition of certain legal rights held by gay couples. Only a small number of EU Member States give legal recognition to the latter."
"This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States."
"Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable."
"The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraph 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula."
"This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools."
"A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/78/EC)."
"Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining ‘the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefs’."
"Worded in such a way, this right of parents is a universally recognised in international law."
"In view of these decisions by Parliament, I have decided to vote against the report and the resolution."
". It is crucial that we adopt an integrated and consistent approach to the fight against discrimination and xenophobia and that we derive maximum benefit from exchanging experiences and best practice."
"Equal treatment and respect for diversity are in the interests of the whole of society."
"We have adopted a series of directives aimed at ensuring that every citizen is provided with effective legal protection against all forms of discrimination."
"Yet whilst we have created a strong legal framework to combat discrimination, the big problem that remains to be addressed is that of ensuring that it is implemented effectively and efficiently."
"The protection of minorities is of major importance, especially following the last enlargement, which gave rise to a larger number of Member States with a huge cultural and linguistic diversity."
"Community legislation and policy must be in a position to support the efforts made by these Member States to address the problems faced by minorities, such as promoting their inclusion and involvement."
"All forms of discrimination are unacceptable, but we cannot force any Member State to change its legislation to accept situations that run counter to their moral and cultural traditions."
"The subsidiarity principle must be upheld and the responsibility shared by the Union and the Member States on this issue of human rights must be fulfilled."
"It is important to have an efficient anti-discrimination policy, as well as effective protection of minorities."
"These are, however, issues that, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, it is up to each Member State to deal with, so they should not be decided about at EU level."
"The June List believes that it is the Council of Europe and the European Court of Justice that should take care of political and/or legal supervision."
".– The parliamentary group of the Panhellenic Socialist Party at the European Parliament will be voting in favour of the Moraes report."
"As the report states, equal treatment is a fundamental right."
"At the same time, it notes that the Member States of the Union have different definitions for ethnic, national and religious minorities and groups within their borders on the basis of their legislation and/or international conventions."
"The constitutional and legal structure of the Member States and the relevant provisions of international law cannot under any circumstances be construed as being contested or affected by this report."
". The wording of paragraph 24, which calls on the Commission to eliminate obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples, could serve as a basis for the recognition of certain legal rights held by gay couples. Only a small number of EU Member States give legal recognition to the latter."
"This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States."
"Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable."
"The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraph 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula."
"This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools."
"A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/87/EC)."
"Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining ‘the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefs’."
"Worded in such a way, this right of parents is universally recognised in international law."
"In view of these decisions by Parliament, I have decided to vote against the report and the resolution."
". – The report 'on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged Europe' contains everything except the basic fact that the discrimination in the EU against women, young people, ethnic immigrant minorities, the disabled etc. is the result of the anti-grass roots and unfeeling policies of the ΕU, on the one hand, and has a very deep, class-based nature, on the other."
"It does not cut across the social divide; it mainly affects the poorer, grass-roots sections of society."
"It refers to numerous forms of actual discrimination in the workplace against women and young people, but passes in silence over the high rates of unemployment and the inhumane, flexible forms of employment applied mainly to young people and women, as a result of Lisbon-type strategies."
"The report passes in silence over the scandalous discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic States, despite the fact that the Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly raised the problem in the European Parliament."
"The people subject to discrimination should not delude themselves; only their fight, in cooperation with consistent, working-class movements, with the fighting grass-roots movements, can put the brakes on their marginalisation and exclusion from the social and political rights of which capitalism and its political exponents have deprived them."
". The protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies often swing between two extremes – there is either a shortfall, in terms of policies and protection, or a surplus, in terms of solutions that clearly go beyond their stated objective and become models, which should not be imposed on the Member States and to which I am generally opposed."
"This is precisely what has happened in the report before us."
"The group to which I belong tabled a number of amendments that would have turned the report into a series of acceptable and positive proposals. Those amendments were unfortunately not adopted, and I therefore voted against the report."
"I feel that on issues such as these, I repeat, both shortfall and surplus are detrimental."
"The right to be different should not be confused with imposing equality."
"They are not the same thing and do not produce the same results."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on reform of the UN."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I said this morning that one of the items on the agenda for the European Council was reform of the UN, and in particular the summit in September of this year, during which we hope this reform can be introduced."
"As we have already discussed and emphasised, the European Union attaches very great importance to that reform."
"On a number of occasions we have expressed our support for the contents of the report of the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, presented on 21 March of this year, and the preparatory reports on which it was based."
"These reports are in line with the general approach set out in the European security strategy, and open up some promising avenues towards a stronger and more effective multilateralism."
"The European Union supports the global concept of collective security recommended by the Secretary-General, recognising that threats to peace and security are not only represented by war, international conflicts, riots, organised crime, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, but also by poverty, under-development, deadly epidemics and environmental damage – in particular the issue of global warming."
"The European Union gives its agreement in principle to the package of measures presented by the Secretary-General, while at the same time maintaining an open mind."
"It intends to play a leadership role in the preparatory process for the September summit."
"The Union believes that significant efforts must be made to obtain the best possible results at the summit across a wide spectrum of issues."
"It is crucial to maintain a balance between the Secretary-General’s three major objectives of development, security and human rights."
"The challenge is, therefore, to achieve a critical mass of reforms within a consistent long-term approach, while at the same time holding out the possibility of further progress later on."
"We in the European Union are accustomed to these step-by-step approaches, with recourse to transition periods."
"As regards development, the European Union fully shares the Secretary-General’s view on the interdependence of the various areas involved."
"It would also emphasise unambiguously that development is an end in itself, not merely a means to achieve security."
"The Union is firmly committed to implementing the Millennium Declaration. It emphasises the link between achieving the Millennium goals and the implementation of the results of UN international conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and other spheres."
"I am not even going to reiterate the goals we set during the last General Affairs Council on the issue of increasing development aid up to 2015."
"The Union would like a certain number of matters of vital importance for the achievement of the Millennium goals to be taken into due account in the conclusions of the summit."
"We also attach particular importance to joint and collective action to combat AIDS."
"We want to reflect jointly on the link between environmental viability, security and the elimination of poverty."
"With regard to the various security-related aspects, the European Union strongly supports the idea of creating a peace consolidation committee."
"This is a priority for the Union, and an agreement on this issue at the September summit is vital."
"This proposal serves to plug a gap."
"During the migration from a state of war to a state of lasting peace, this peace consolidation committee could help intensify the UN-led planning activity in support of a lasting recovery, while at the same time strengthening the institutions which guarantee the rule of law and good governance."
"In parallel, it could play a significant role in the prevention of subsequent conflicts, which is often an important factor in cementing a lasting peace."
"This peace consolidation committee would be a permanent body which could assist the Security Council and Ecosoc during the various phases of the conflict."
"The link with Ecosoc is particularly important in relation to development."
"The committee should also help to ensure that reconstruction and peace-keeping strategies are consistent."
"In relation to the prevention of terrorism, the Union supports the global strategy proposed by the Secretary-General both in his report and in his Madrid speech."
"We need to emphasise that terrorism is unacceptable in all circumstances, irrespective of the underlying causes invoked."
"The Union would point out that the five pillars of the Secretary-General’s proposed approach coincide with the strategy which the Union has been developing since the 11 September 2001 attacks, and which it subsequently reaffirmed following the tragic events in Madrid."
"The European Union also supports the Secretary-General’s recommendations in relation to non-proliferation and disarmament – recommendations which, in general terms, coincide with the approach in the European strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"As it will only be possible to achieve results through a collective effort, the Union is ready to take initiatives in that direction, in a multilateral context, and to raise these issues during its regular contacts and political dialogue in order to convince its partners to take account of these recommendations as well."
"The Union believes that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represents the gravest and most immediate threat to international peace and stability."
"Universal guarantee agreements and additional protocols should now be the norm in terms of nuclear verification."
"Additionally, negotiations for a treaty to halt the production of fissile material should be brought rapidly to a successful conclusion."
"The Union also intends to take an active part in the development of binding international instruments to regulate the marking, tracing and illicit dealing in small-calibre arms and light weapons, issues we have already had the opportunity of discussing during sittings of this Parliament."
"The Union reiterates its hope that adoption of the principle of the responsibility to protect can become one of the major priorities of the summit."
"Violations of human rights, impunity and breaches of the rule of law remain among the main factors threatening peace and security, while at the same time hindering the development process."
"The Union supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to adopt and apply the principle of the responsibility to protect the potential or actual victims of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other mass violations of human rights."
"Finally, as regards the use of force, the Union believes that the concept and principles proposed by the Secretary-General represent a good basis on which all parties should be prepared to work."
"The criteria proposed are political rather than legal in nature and should reflect a broad international consensus, which should prove helpful to members of the Security Council in their deliberations which could potentially lead to the use of force."
"I should like to applaud the importance accorded to human rights and the rule of law in the Secretary-General’s report."
"The Union supports any proposal to reinforce democracy and to place human rights at the centre of the UN's system."
"We insist on the need to reinforce the system of human rights, in particular by incorporating them into all the activities of the UN system, which would strengthen its capacity to react at any time to breaches of those rights."
"We also support the appeal to strengthen the office of the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights and to allocate sufficient funding to reinforce his ability to discharge his mandate."
"The Union therefore agrees with the establishment of a permanent Council for Human Rights, as it could help to enhance the importance attached to human rights within the UN system."
"Sixty years after the war and after the creation of the United Nations, the time has come to give fresh impetus to multilateralism, to reform the United Nations system, a system vital for global security, harmonious development of all nations and the consolidation of peace."
"I believe we have a real opportunity."
"The European Union must play an active part in that reform and I count on Parliament to support the Council and Commission in that endeavour."
". Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss UN reform before the crucial UN Summit in September."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, on his report."
"The September 2005 UN Summit, to be held on the 60th anniversary of the UN, is an opportunity that must not be missed."
"The summit represents an opportunity to take decisions leading to a more efficient United Nations and one that is better equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century."
"In the last three weeks President Barroso and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have both been to New York, where they held constructive discussions on the summit preparations with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, his deputy, Louise Fréchette, and the President of the UN General Assembly, Ambassador Ping."
"During those talks, all the parties underlined the need for continuous and strong EU leadership in the preparations for the summit, in order to achieve substantial results in September."
"The Commission, together with the presidency and Member States, is thus reaching out to partners, both in New York and in capitals throughout the world."
"The active involvement of Parliament in mobilising other parliamentarians around the world on the summit agenda would also be extremely useful."
"On 3 June we received the draft outcome for the summit, which provides us with a good starting point but nonetheless requires a strong European Union input if we are to achieve ambitious results during the September summit."
"I am glad to see that the views expressed in the resolution tabled by this Parliament are similar to those of the Commission in many respects."
"As the UN Secretary General's report correctly states and as is underlined in Parliament's resolution, progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) requires urgent attention."
"A serious boost to common actions is needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015."
"On 24 May the European Council agreed the Commission's ambitious proposals to achieve collectively 0.56% of GNI for ODA by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015."
"This is an important step forward for international solidarity and a clear sign of the European Union's commitment to a successful summit."
"We hope that it will provide a strong impetus for others to follow our example."
"Allow me to address a few of the UN reform proposals on the table that are of particular interest for reinvigorating the effectiveness of the United Nations."
"The Commission has been actively engaged in the discussions on the proposed Peace Building Commission, which could fill the very real gap that currently exists within the UN institutional machinery for dealing with the period between the end of a conflict and long-term sustainable development."
"I welcome the resolution's support for the Peace Building Commission."
"The Commission supports as broad a mandate as possible for the Peace Building Commission, including support for democracy, functioning institutions and strengthening the rule of law."
"Its work should consolidate peace and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts."
"In terms of its membership, both UN Security Council and ECOSOC membership should be represented, as well as major donors and contributors to peace building, international financing institutions, and key UN agencies, funds and programmes."
"The European Community's longstanding, worldwide and sustained peace building efforts are well known."
"I am therefore glad to inform you that, in the preparatory work for the summit, the European Union has decided to press for the participation of the European Community in all meetings of the Peace Building Commission."
"I trust that Parliament will be able to support that position."
"The Commission strongly welcomes the UN Secretary General's proposals relating to human rights A substantial reform of the current UN human rights architecture, including the replacement of the ailing UN Commission on Human Rights by a standing Human Rights Council, is essential if the system is to be made more efficient and credible."
"The ultimate objective is to make human rights protection and promotion effective worldwide."
"I am therefore delighted to see that we agree on the proposed Human Rights Council."
"The proposed election of the Council by the General Assembly should extend a sense of ownership to the wider UN community."
"Ownership must, however, be balanced by responsibility and the Secretary-General's view that States seeking membership of the Council should demonstrate a 'solid record of commitment to the highest human rights standards' is a welcome requirement, also in view of the obligations deriving from membership of the Council."
"Obviously the issue of reforming the Security Council is one of the high-profile elements of the current UN reform debate."
"I note with interest the proposals made in the resolution for the establishment of an 'EU' seat."
"Whilst Security Council reform is naturally an issue of great importance, it must not be allowed to stall the whole process of vital reform of other UN institutions or other important areas where progress is needed."
"I would call upon all Member States of the UN to make every effort to ensure such paralysis does not occur."
"The Commission fully supports better environmental integration across the UN system, including the establishment of a UN Environmental Organisation, and is delighted to see that the European Union is coming together on this."
"I shall conclude by stating my satisfaction at the degree of concurrence that exists between us on many of the key topics at the heart of this issue."
"Furthermore, I wish to underline the Commission's determination to continue to work towards achieving good results in September and ensuring implementation of the summit's outcome."
". Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner Borg, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Union is enduring and debating one crisis after another, the affirmation of belief in effective multilateralism and in a strong United Nations is a credo around which most of this House, along with the Council and the Commission, can unite."
"This September, in New York, the European Union should send out a clear message to the effect that we want reform and institutions that work better, and that we encourage Kofi Annan to proceed down this road."
"I see this as a typical example that we could put before those members of the public who think that the nation states might achieve more."
"The challenges that we face, though, leave us no alternative to action on a global scale."
"If we are to combat terrorism, to address the problems of failing states, if we are to deal with the world’s shifting climate and to campaign for human rights and democracy around the world, then we need a strong United Nations."
"So it is, then, that in the report to be put before the plenary tomorrow, the House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs has limited itself to responding to the High Panel’s proposals."
"Rather than drafting a new report on the UN in succession to the one we adopted last year, we have got to grips with what the High Panel has proposed, and one topic that has been very much on our minds in doing this has been that of collective security."
"Reform of the United Nations should be underpinned by the principles of prevention, awareness and shared responsibility."
"Something else that had a high priority for us was freedom from want, in the shape of a renewed development policy, something that ties in very well this year with the fifth anniversary of the year 2000’s Millennium Goals."
"The third thing that matters to us is that the institutions be renewed and made more representative and more efficient, and so we have reiterated our call for a seat for Europe."
"We know it is not realistic to expect to achieve this by September, but, even if Europe does not get a seat, we want it to be more present."
"If there are to be new seats of whatever kind, we want them to go to the European Union, which will then appoint its representatives in the Security Council."
"That would be a small sign that things were going in the right direction."
"The United Nations cannot be reformed by its Secretary-General; that is for the states to do."
"It is for that reason that we appeal to the European Council for the states represented within it to join together in supporting Kofi Annan and his programme of reform."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a globalised economy calls for globalised politics."
"A stronger United Nations is the right response to the challenges that the international community faces in the 21st century."
"I am glad of the general agreement in the House, and grateful to Mr Laschet for his report."
"We may be in different groups, but we take a similar view of things."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament see it as important that reforms should not be limited to the institutions, but should also aim to strengthen the UN in the performance of its tasks and in its mission."
"One prominent objective for the coming years is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; we have to succeed in halving the incidence of poverty, illiteracy and the major diseases by 2015."
"If we manage that, we will have made a contribution to the world’s peace and stability."
"The UN’s role in peace missions and in conflict management needs to be enhanced."
"A large number of proposals have been made as to how this might be done, ranging from an anti-terrorist convention to the delegation of the rights contained in Chapter VII of the UN Charter to recognised regional organisations such as the African Union or the European Union."
"Why should peoples not resolve the conflicts on their own continents themselves, before the men in blue helmets arrive from elsewhere?"
"Let me turn to the need for stronger institutions."
"The Security Council is the sensitive issue here."
"We are agreed that Europe should, in the long term, have a seat on it."
"It may be that a mechanism is already being devised for its non-permanent members whereby the European Council would mandate Member States to perform this duty on the European Union’s behalf and in consultation with its institutions."
"The UN also needs to be made more democratic."
"The demand is also being made for a Parliamentary Assembly within the UN; let us seize the opportunity, for it is one that does not come often."
"Now is the time for the package to be wrapped up!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 was a very difficult year for global organisations, and so 2005 will be all the more decisive for the United Nations."
"Never before has there been such a great desire for fundamental renewal of the organisation; never before, too, has reform been so urgently needed."
"Like Mr Leinen and Mr Laschet, who have already spoken, I rejoice in the broad consensus that we have here: the clear affirmation of belief in the Millennium Development Goals is something we can all echo, just as we can all aim to improve the synergy between conflict prevention, peacemaking and peacekeeping."
"We are agreed on the need for better resources – and more of them – for this, and on the need for a more rapid response to events in crisis regions, with clear rules for deployments in them."
"To address acute dangers such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is a need not only for clearly defined and internationally recognised rules, but also the political will to act."
"It is in this respect that the international legal standard that is coming into being, and according to which we have a duty to defend others, constitutes a quite crucial step forward."
"Reform of the UN’s institutions will be the most difficult hurdle to overcome."
"Its General Assembly must become more productive; rather than mounting, year in and year out, repetitively vacuous debates without concrete results, it must get back to debating things that really matter."
"ECOSOC, too, must make a markedly better job of performing its tasks."
"The Security Council, too, is in need of reform."
"On 24 June, the Committee on Foreign Affairs put before the House a resolution it had adopted on this subject."
"While united in our desire for a permanent seat on it, we do know – particularly after the failure of the referenda – that the legal and institutional framework conditions for such a seat will not be in place before mid-September this year."
"Is this a reason to delay the reform?"
"No, it is not; the world will not wait for the EU, and so all our Member States must, for the United Nations’ sake and for multilateralism’s sake, give the reform their backing, even though not all of them will be able to have a seat in September."
"The mechanism to which Mr Laschet referred is one that we have devised together; it involves the European seats being allocated in close consultation with the EU."
"I might add that this debate – particularly after the failure of the French referendum – should be being held in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity to implement fundamental reform of the United Nations is an historic one, one in which Europe can and must play an important part, and so it is a very good thing that there is a large majority in this House giving its backing to the High Panel’s report on reform of the UN and to Kofi Annan’s report, which is derived from it."
"Implementation of this report and completion of the reform are matters of importance in terms of world politics, and I was very glad to hear that both the Council and the Commission are committed to this."
"There are four major and crucial aspects of this reform in which we must make progress."
"The first is the reform and extension of the UN Security Council, accompanied by the clear and unambiguous definition of the UN’s exclusive right to exercise force."
"It would be a very good thing if the discussion on the expansion of the Security Council were to enable Europe to get a seat on it, resulting in a real structural change in the way in which Europe’s policies are represented."
"The second is the process of transforming international development policy into an international structural policy in the true sense of the word."
"The essential means to this end is the reinforcement and upgrading of the United Nations’ Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC; and close cooperation between it and the Group of Twenty really could plant the seed and lay the foundation of a new World Economic Council, which would be capable of steering the global economy in the direction of a sustainable policy."
"Thirdly, the UN’s environmental programmes need to be transformed into a real UN environmental organisation, one that is sustainable and well organised."
"This is a major task."
"The fourth point is an important one: the Human Rights Commission should be upgraded to a permanent council on human rights elected by the General Assembly."
"Security policy, development policy, environmental policy, human rights policy – these are the four pillars in which we need to make progress."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at 60 years old, the United Nations is younger than I am but I genuinely hope that it has a longer life than mine and ours and that it can witness development, democracy and justice for the people of this world."
"The devastation of the Second World War, the horror and the uniqueness of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazis, the deaths of millions of people and soldiers, not to mention the unpunished crime of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought forth a hope and a commitment: that the peoples of the United Nations could be certain of having a vehicle to make war history."
"That is now a long time ago."
"The UN has lost its effectiveness and the major countries have striven to see it go under – one need only think about the preventative and humanitarian wars, which in reality have been trials of lethal weapons, virtually weapons of mass destruction."
"Reform, or rather, a refounding of the United Nations is crucial."
"The Organisation has to return to a situation in which it is able to maintain peace by means of justice, promote disarmament, combat poverty and uphold democracy."
"Upholding democracy also means guaranteeing transparency and participation, not only by national governments, but also by the people and civil society."
"Mr Laschet’s report is important, as is the ability of our Parliament to strive towards strengthening and coordinating the United Nations."
"I agree with his proposals: strengthening the commitment towards human rights, protecting nature and the environment, combating poverty and strengthening the European Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC)."
"Those are all fundamental commitments, also in terms of achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"Mr Laschet was speaking about ‘freedom from want’ and about the need to encourage Kofi Annan and obviously to forcefully resume the Agenda for Peace issued by Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992."
"Finally, I would like to highlight a fundamental issue, that is, the complete anachronism of the Security Council and its anti-democratic nature, which is symbolised by the right of veto."
"I believe that it is important to strive towards abolishing it and for the European Union to be represented by one voice, together with the other continents."
".– Mr President, we are in a fairly extraordinary situation this afternoon, discussing a project which is devoid of substance in a forum which has no right to debate it."
"I will ignore the vacuity of the project, reform of the UN: when I first had the honour of serving my country in the UN, in 1992, the issue of UN reform was already under discussion."
"The story is old hat!"
"The fact is that the UN is based on a Security Council which, in turn, is based on five permanent members, who have taken the UN as far as it could go – often for the better but sometimes for the worse."
"As for Europe, it is represented in the UN by non-permanent rotating members and by two major powers holding a right of veto, namely Great Britain and France."
"Moreover, no alternative architecture appears possible."
"However, that is not the worst aspect."
"This Parliament has no power to debate this subject, or even – as Mr Laschet has said in somewhat derisory fashion – to send messages to New York."
"That is absolutely meaningless."
"Our separatist French delegation will not take part in the vote tomorrow as a sign of protest against the determination of this Parliament to act as if it could encroach on the States’ prerogatives, and, worse still, to act as if there had been no referendum, or, in other words, as if the Constitution was not dead."
"I solemnly warn you against a collective abuse of power: we are behaving as if, one day, there could be a Constitution, or a common foreign and security policy, or a European foreign minister."
"These things will never happen!"
"The people do not want them."
"And if you want to impose them by force, you would be basing the future development of Europe on a , thereby rendering all our decisions illegal and eliciting an appropriate – and undoubtedly violent – response from our citizens."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in mid-June the offensive of the so-called ‘G4’ will be launched, which intends to put forward a proposal for a resolution to the General Assembly that will increase the number of permanent members to 11, thus leaving the other 180 members of the UN to compete for the non-permanent seats."
"Approval of that proposal will increase the disparity among the Member States of the UN and will pose the problem of extending the right of veto, with the attendant risk of paralysing the Security Council."
"At European level, Germany’s entry into the Council would conversely mean abandoning once and for all a project of a Europe endowed with a serious and effective foreign policy."
"Italy, which has always been committed to the European Union having one single seat, is now leading the UFC group, which is opposed to the G4 proposal, hoping for the Council to be restructured on a regional basis."
"It is only by means of this type of reform that the European Union would obtain the role that belongs to it at international level."
"National egoisms need to be put to one side if we are to offer the European Union a credible political future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the absolute necessity to reform the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular."
"In order to be effective, however, a reform has to be agreed upon by the largest number of countries possible, it has to enjoy a broad consensus, it has to reflect the growing importance of regionalism in international relations, and it cannot be rushed through."
"We condemn plans to reform the Security Council like the so-called ‘G4 plan’, as Mrs Angelilli pointed out, which would result in weakening the main body of the United Nations and freezing it in its current difficulties."
"We believe that all countries have the right to serve in the Security Council, by means of periodic elections guaranteeing that the many regional experiences are represented."
"In this spirit, we have asked for separate votes on paragraphs 19, 20 and 21, in order to remove a number of ambiguities in Mr Laschet’s nonetheless excellent report."
"Much is said, including in this House, on the issue of a European seat."
"In order for something like that to exist, however, a common European foreign policy is required, and I believe that we are still very far from reaching that objective."
"There is no doubt, moreover, that the recent twin ‘no’ vote on the Constitution has made the passage even more difficult."
"One day the European seat will be obtained but here and now we rule out permanently delegating one Member State to represent the Union, as that would discriminate against the other Member States, even though Italy would in that case have the full numbers required to be able to stand as a candidate."
"The United Nations is currently undergoing embarrassing revelations and scandals that are damaging its reputation."
"When we talk about reforms, therefore, we must not only consider the Security Council, but also, as this report rightly does, the United Nations in its entirety."
"Having been powerless and crippled for many years by the rivalry between the superpowers, the United Nations has once again to find new energy and new life."
"– Mr President, as a French citizen I feel bound to begin this speech by rejecting the comments I have just heard from one of my fellow citizens. The demise of a draft Constitution is not the end of all the Treaties binding us together!"
"Europe has done enough to earn the right to send a collective message."
"Laschet, my congratulations on your good report!"
"If there is any abuse of power – that was indeed the word used – it is by taking the salary of a Member of the European Parliament and then biting the hand that feeds you, ignoring all the efforts we have been making for sixty years."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I support this Laschet report."
"In these dark days for Europe, I am happy to see this rare moment of convergence between the Council, the Commission and our Parliament."
"I am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is customary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and I am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate."
"Mr President, I should like to give you a message for the Presidency."
"We can try to reform the United Nations, but it would be better to start by reforming ourselves."
"I am certain that the 700 or so colleagues who are absent are not merely enjoying a siesta. They are at work in their offices."
"Our work is badly organised."
"We need one or two major debates in plenary session each month in this building and, apart from that, everything should be discussed in committees."
"These debates should be dignified affairs."
"It is impossible, with only a couple of minutes available, to make an analysis or express a line of thought."
"I would therefore say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – begging your pardon for representing a Parliament of which I am basically a little ashamed – that my main concern is that by defending this good report and all the good work we do together in Europe, you might be aiming at the wrong target."
"There are too many responsibilities, too may targets."
"It is true that Europe has its reasons for wanting a seat on the Security Council."
"It is true that the time is not ripe and this is virtually out of the question at present."
"I would advise you not to waste too much time on it and to focus on what is reasonably possible, on what would generally make a difference and on aspects where our work, and in particular the Laschet report, can be constructive."
"I would quote Article 2 and chapter VII on the transfer of the right to invoke the Charter to regional organisations."
"This is a great innovation."
"I would also cite the transformation of the Trusteeship Council into a Council for Failed States."
"Finally, I would mention the introduction, in Article 17, of a reference to global public goods."
"As I have overrun my allotted time, I will stop here."
"This is all absurd; we are all saying more or less the same thing."
"Do not aim for the wrong target."
"Concentrate on the innovative aspects – and only on them – and we shall have done a good job."
"Mr President, like my colleagues, I believe that –– as is the case with the European Union –– if the United Nations Organisation did not exist, it would have to be invented."
"That is a fact."
"And it is also the case that the United Nations must be reformed, just as we are doing in the European Union."
"In the specific case of the United Nations, an in-depth and immediate reform is clearly urgent, fundamentally because the Member States are currently subjecting it to a twofold restriction, of a budgetary nature, firstly, and secondly, of a political nature."
"The reports by the high-level panel and by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, provide, I believe –– and here I agree with Mr Laschet –– an excellent starting point for analysis and debate, and I would therefore also urge the Commission and the Council to take them sufficiently into account."
"It is important to remember the anti-war mobilisations, in particular those that led us to question the importance of a war in Iraq."
"I believe that, at this time when world military spending has risen to one billion dollars per year while at the same time the States do not provide money for the Millennium objectives, this review is more necessary than ever."
"Mr President, the recent Brok report argued that the EU as a whole should play a major role within the UN."
"The PPE-DE Group amendment to the report demanded that the EU should be guaranteed a seat in the UN Security Council."
"That word ‘guaranteed’ is incompatible with the UN High-level Panel’s view that no change in the composition of the Security Council should be regarded as permanent in the future."
"In both of the Panel’s proposed models for reform of the Security Council, the current permanent members would retain seats."
"That is not what the Eurofanatics want to hear. They want the EU to take over the seats of France and the UK."
"However, even Mr Brok’s report conceded that an increased role for the EU was pending the entry into force of the new Constitutional Treaty."
"The Constitution is dead; the EU has no legal personality;"
"Europe is not a nation and the EU, therefore, has no place in the United Nations."
"Mr President, we must never forget that the collective interest is the national interest, especially in a world full of terrorism."
"One of the most important functions of the United Nations is the delivery of its aid to the less developed world."
"Corruption and a lack of transparency erode public support."
"A fundamental reform is needed of what the United Nations does with its aid delivery."
"For the first time, Internet technology has made it possible to bring transparency into the raising of international aid funding in the donor countries and the delivery of aid in the recipient countries."
"We must be able to see how the aid is being spent, brick by brick."
"A closer involvement by citizens through the Internet will create a new driving force for the effective delivery of aid and for holding governments, the United Nations and other NGOs accountable."
"Civil strife and gross violations of human rights are the principal obstacles to United Nations development objectives."
"One civil war can undo decades of development effort."
"It is therefore essential to give our full backing to the work of the international criminal courts and to make it clear that anyone who commits crimes against humanity will be personally called to account for his or her action."
"The United Nations must be able to anticipate and prevent."
"It must be a peace-builder and a peacekeeper."
"On 24 February, this Parliament passed a unanimous resolution demanding that Nigeria surrender to the United Nations international court the former President of Liberia, who has been charged with war crimes by the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone."
"Why has the United Nations Security Council failed to reinforce this demand with a mandatory resolution under Chapter VII?"
"The United Nations Commission on Human Rights must be replaced with a stronger human rights council, with membership barred to nations with poor human rights records."
"Finally, the United Nations must return to its roots."
"It must reform a stagnant bureaucracy."
"It must sweep away a dysfunctional committee."
"It must focus on an active United Nations parliamentary assembly, a good governance and democracy promotion unit."
"It must become the three pillars: peace and security, justice and human rights, and development."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Laschet on his excellent report and the UN working group that was also involved in drafting it."
"Reform of the UN is indispensable, as it is the only multilateral organisation able to take up the gauntlet of the challenges of the new era effectively and successfully."
"Part of this process of reform will involve reviewing the number of members on the Security Council and its scope and the means and adjusting them to meet the new challenges."
"The only possible way of solving its problems is to adopt an integrated approach, which takes economic, social, development, security and human rights dimensions into account."
"We must not forget that efforts to reform the UN and the common security and institutional reforms aimed at promoting the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, closely complement one another."
"I therefore welcome the development ministers’ decision creating resources for this purpose."
"Successful realisation of the aims set out in the Millennium Development Goals is crucial for Europe in a globalised world."
"Reducing poverty, effectively eradicating starvation and meeting drinking water needs are all vitally important issues and postponing efforts to find solutions is not an option."
"The dangers are imminent and complex; successful implementation of reforms is more urgent now than it has ever been."
"– Mr President, I shall devote these few words to an extremely important issue, namely the reform of the United Nations programme for human rights."
"I am delighted to see – not only here in Parliament but also in the Commission and the Council – that the general outline of a reform of the UN’s instruments assessing human rights is emerging and, moreover, that it corresponds to the work now being undertaken, by which I mean the package proposed by the UN Secretary-General and also the action plan which has just been submitted to Kofi Annan by the High Commissioner, Mrs Louise Arbour."
"These are extremely interesting approaches which, moreover, are echoed in the excellent report by Mr Laschet."
"The transformation into a permanent council is obviously a revolution in the UN’s system of human rights."
"Why?"
"Because it will provide us with a body able to apply permanent pressure on countries violating human rights, and, as we have just said, these violations are a permanent threat to security, development and peace."
"That is an absolutely vital reform."
"With regard to the increase in the resources available to the High Commissioner’s office, I believe everyone is in agreement."
"I think we shall also have to look at the substance of the activity of this Council and at the way it works: in that area, the reference that the European Parliament’s report makes to peer group assessment – namely assessment by other countries – which is a transparent, just and equitable appraisal system for all countries, helping to avoid the charge of double standards, appears an absolutely fundamental one."
"Mr President, the EU Member States have different views on how the UN system should be reformed."
"Allow the Member States to discuss this matter with other UN members."
"This debate should not be conducted within the framework of EU cooperation but in a broader international context."
"It is clear that an EU strategy for reforming the UN system is largely aimed at safeguarding European, rather than global, interests."
"The motion for a resolution points out that the objective is that the EU countries should in the long run speak with a single voice in the Security Council."
"We are unsympathetic to this proposal."
"Clearly, the countries of Europe have different foreign policy positions."
"This emerged, in particular, in connection with the Iraq war."
"France and Great Britain are examples of countries that often have different approaches to foreign policy issues."
"Would it be at all possible to speak with a single European voice in the Security Council?"
"Would the voices of small countries, such as Sweden, be heard at all?"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, for the work he has done."
"It is difficult to achieve a broad consensus between the different groups and delegations on such a complex issue as the reform of the United Nations."
"This reform involves many important issues."
"I will restrict myself essentially to three aspects."
"Firstly, the need for effective multilateralism in order to deal with the problems of the international community."
"No single country or single group of countries can say everything, but rather we need a multilateral approach, and multilateralism requires representative and effective institutions."
"Hence the importance and the need for a reform of the United Nations."
"Secondly, the reform of the United Nations Security Council, the body that is essential to maintaining international peace and security."
"Its representativeness must be increased and its operation improved, but I do not believe the best solution to be the so-called ‘model A’, that is to say increasing the number of permanent members, an idea which I believe to be rather anachronistic."
"One essential objective clearly taken up in Mr Laschet’s report, is that the European Union itself should sit on the Security Council of the United Nations."
"This objective is entirely consistent with the idea of a common foreign and security policy, and it will be even more so if the constitutional treaty enters into force."
"But if the model that is finally accepted in New York is that of allowing new permanent members, I believe that the new seat should be for the European Union."
"I find it particularly striking that, at a time when so much is being said about a common foreign and security policy, or a future foreign affairs minister, this issue, surprisingly, is not being debated in the Council of the Union; the European Union's presence on the United Nations Security Council is not being debated in the Council and, today, the representative of the Council – I do not know if he is listening – appears not to have mentioned this issue."
"Given the fundamental importance of the reform of the United Nations Organisation, and in particular of its Security Council, I believe that it should be approved on the basis of the broadest possible consensus."
"A reform of this significance should not be implemented on the basis of just a two-thirds majority, because that is not reasonable."
"A greater consensus is needed."
"Thirdly, I am pleased that the report stresses the fight against terrorism and, in this regard, I will not just emphasise Resolution 1373, but also the importance of assisting the victims of terrorism."
"Resolution 1566 has also taken a first step in this direction."
"We must continue to improve and to make progress in this direction."
"– Mr President, the post-war balances reflected institutionally in the UN have now been overturned."
"New international problems and challenges threaten world peace and stability."
"The international system is governed by the omnipotence of the United States and its unilateral perception of how to resolve international problems."
"The legitimising role of the UN has been reduced, while its efficacy and credibility have been dangerously weakened."
"Mankind needs a new, democratic, multilateral system which will express contemporary geographical and political realities."
"That is why the reform of the UN system is a necessary precondition to a world of peace, freedom, democracy, growth and justice."
"The report by the UN Secretary-General and his proposed reforms are a bold response to the challenges of our times."
"The report by Mr Laschet also moves in this direction."
"However, no reform will be able to achieve its objective unless the UN regains its lost credibility as regards the application of its resolutions."
"Crucial resolutions on peace and stability have not been applied on the pretext of serving the current international economic situation and the interests of the major powers."
"Up to now we have been witnessing selective sensibilities in the application of UN resolutions and I think that this is a serious omission in Mr Laschet's report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kofi Annan stated that environmental damage, water shortages and the effects of climate change were now killing more people than terrorist attacks."
"The UN’s proposed environmental reforms, although given a mention, are not yet equal to the challenges facing the planet, despite the fact that the UN has a responsibility to organise the resources to combat predicted disasters, which will turn millions of people into ecological refugees."
"Who will provide a home for those dispossessed nations whose land has been swallowed up by the sea?"
"What authority will defend nature in the commercial decision-making of the WTO, a body which has already shown that it gives scant consideration to environmental damage?"
"Because the environment is not a commodity, because environmental standards must take preference over trade, because legal relationships must be clarified when settling conflicts between the WTO and multilateral agreements on the environment within the United Nations system itself, the UN environmental programme must be transformed into a global environmental organisation, in order to protect our shared public asset, the earth."
"With international institutional recognition, no one will again be able to evade his responsibility to the planet and to future generations."
"A motion for a resolution(1) to wind up the debate has been tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2)."
". Mr President, as I have said before, we share many of the views of this Parliament on the reform of the United Nations."
"We all agree that a strong and effective United Nations is for the benefit not only of the European Union but also of the international community as a whole."
"We can support many of the proposals in the Secretary-General’s report."
"As I have stated, our priorities are to secure greater success in the achievement of the Millennium Goals."
"We are equally committed to seeing progress in the field of post-conflict situations and, therefore, we support the proposal for a peace-building commission as an instrument that will fill an existing gap between post-conflict situations and long-term sustainable peace."
"Our commitment to human rights is unwavering and the proposals on the table for a human rights council will get our full support."
"Equally, we will support the creation of a UN environmental organisation, which will further consolidate the central focus of our actions in the field of the environment."
"On climate change, we believe that the summit should call for more collaborative efforts to achieve the objectives of a UN climate change convention."
"The summit should endorse the UN Secretary-General’s proposals to ensure concerted global action to mitigate climate change and develop a more inclusive international framework for climate change beyond 2012."
"The Commission wholly endorses the contents of the UN Secretary-General’s report on the proposal for a comprehensive convention on terrorism and calls for Member States to agree a definition of terrorism."
"The UN Secretary-General rightly underlines in his report that the accumulation and proliferation of small arms and light weapons continue to threaten the international security, human safety, as well as socio-economic stability."
"The summit should echo the UN Secretary-General’s appeal for consensus on the legally binding convention on the marking and tracing of small arms and to expedite negotiations on an instrument on illicit brokering and the supply of arms."
"The Commission further hopes that the summit will lead to the start of negotiations on an international arms trade treaty."
"With regard to the proposal to set up a democracy fund, this could provide added value."
"It would make a real difference if it were used to jointly identify key priorities, general programming and to provide political guidance for those eligible countries seeking to strengthen democratic practice."
"Work now needs to be undertaken to facilitate the emergence of a consensus on the modalities of this fund."
"The Commission underlines the need to restore the political stature of the General Assembly, asserting its role as the main universal deliberative body."
"The Commission is also particularly interested in the ECOSOC reform."
"We support a radical reform to render the body more operational and would like to see its role in all the pillars of sustainable development reinforced."
"Some Members raised the issue of Security Council reform."
"This is clearly an important and central issue."
"However, it should not be an issue that hampers our ability to take actions in a range of other areas that I have highlighted."
"I have again noted your repeated appeal for an EU seat on the Security Council."
"In conclusion, let me state that reform of the United Nations is not an exercise in institutional change for its own sake."
"Our aim is to enhance the ability of this global organisation to meet the challenges of the 21st century in the interests of meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations."
"Seeking to consolidate the areas of agreement that exist between Parliament, the Council and the Commission further enhances our chances of achieving sound results in the reform of this important body."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the Commission for having quickly replaced me during that short absence."
"I believe that the Council will take account of the suggestions, ideas and proposals emerging during this Parliamentary debate and also contained in this draft report."
"The Presidency will obviously communicate the essential aspects of this debate to the future Presidency, because the European Union must now define its position clearly in advance of the September summit."
"I believe, as many of you have said, that the UN is an essential building block of a globalised world."
"To solve the world’s current problems, we need a strong and effective multilateral system."
"It is for that reason that this reform must not be reduced to a handful of details or a few national interests."
"The European Union is best placed – or should be best placed – to show that multilateralism provides the answer to problems which can no longer be solved on a purely national basis."
"I should also like to come back to the proposal concerning a fund for democracy."
"The United Nations human rights system needs root-and-branch reform."
"Too often – and we have discussed this on a number of occasions – developments which are almost absurd occur in the Commission on Human Rights."
"For that reason, to restore greater credibility to the protection of human rights within the UN system, reform is absolutely essential."
"And I believe that this is yet another area in which the European Union can be at the forefront of reform, encouraging it and achieving positive results and solutions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations."
"Mr President, a few months ago, we debated the strengthening of transatlantic relations."
"It followed the visit of President Bush to the European institutions and came after what could be termed the ‘relaunch’ of those relations."
"We are now in the preparatory phase for the forthcoming Euro-Atlantic summit, due to take place at the end of this month."
"It is important that this summit should achieve concrete results so that the relaunch of dialogue, achieved during President Bush’s visit, can become a reality."
"For that reason, I should like to raise a number of points which appear of particular importance for the development of stronger transatlantic relations."
"Firstly, there is the issue of Iran, which was an important item on the agenda during President Bush’s visit."
"Not only have the Americans supported the European initiative, they have also agreed to open negotiations with Iran with a view to its membership of the World Trade Organisation, and Iran’s WTO membership is today an integral part of European strategy."
"I therefore believe that on this extremely sensitive and delicate issue, we have been able to show that cooperation between the US and Europe can provide solutions, and above all that it can produce a consistent strategy, which is, incidentally, first and foremost, a European strategy."
"The Union and the US are organising, and will jointly chair, a conference on the reconstruction of Iraq, to which I referred this morning."
"This decision was announced during the visit of President Bush."
"The announcement gave us the opportunity to show that we had left our disagreements on Iraq behind us."
"The US and the Union have the same aims for that country, namely to help the Iraqi Government in its huge reconstruction effort and, above all, in reinforcing its security."
"It will be a conference at ministerial level with over 80 delegations, a large number of which will be from the region concerned."
"The Iraqi Government, which will be at the very heart of that conference, will therefore have an opportunity to set out its plans and discuss the economic, political and security aspects with the international community represented there."
"In relation to Sudan, the European Union did not merely insist that those responsible for crimes against humanity should be punished, but also that they should be punished through the International Criminal Court."
"As you know, the Union is one of the leading bodies supporting that Court."
"For us, the case of Sudan is an important precedent."
"The Court was set up for precisely that type of situation."
"If the matter were not referred to the International Criminal Court, however, that would create an unfortunate precedent which it would be difficult to overcome in the future."
"After several weeks of intense negotiations, we reached a solution acceptable to everyone, enabling the situation in Sudan to be referred to the International Criminal Court – and this without a US veto."
"Here was yet another situation in which the European Union exercised a wholly positive influence in transatlantic relations, at the same time rendering multilateral action more effective."
"Political dialogue between the European Union and the US has also become more frequent and more strategic on economic issues."
"However, we must stress that major problems remain."
"We are all aware of the case of Boeing and Airbus, and hope that, in the context of the forthcoming summit, we can still reach a satisfactory solution, thereby avoiding this matter being referred to the WTO and thus putting a damper on future Euro-Atlantic relations."
"Additionally, a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun."
"It is true that discussions on the lifting of the embargo on arms exports to China have revealed a lack of debate on strategic changes in Asia."
"The start of this dialogue, therefore, must show our common interests and help the Union to strengthen its own strategic thinking on that important region, now emerging both as a political and, above all, as an economic force."
"In the US Congress, a European Union Caucus has recently been created."
"We hope you will seize this opportunity and take advantage of the increasing interest in the European Union on the part of your US counterparts."
"Dialogue between legislators is important and should be strengthened, particularly in view of the importance of the Senate in the sphere of foreign policy."
"I therefore believe that the development of relations between this Parliament and the US Congress must be a goal of particularly high priority."
"Mr President, these examples show the healthy condition of transatlantic cooperation in the last few months."
"It is vital to work with our American partners on the challenges now facing us."
"These various examples show that we can overcome our differences and adopt a shared approach."
"Major preparatory work is therefore now underway for the forthcoming EU-US summit, due to take place in Washington on 21 June."
"We are counting on a substantial and strategic summit, because it will be focused on vital issues of international relations."
"At the beginning of this month, the troika met the US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice, for that purpose."
"We are working on a number of draft declarations: the Middle East, international peace and security, the promotion of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights, but also Africa, the environment and economic relations."
"In the same way as last year, we are hoping to use these declarations as a basis on which to work."
"During the summit, we shall deal with the most important strategic issues, in particular the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Kosovo situation, but also – and we have just debated it – reform of the United Nations."
"We can only reform the United Nations with the support of the US, and we know that there is still a long way to go on this issue."
"Like us, the Americans undoubtedly support the proposal to create a peace-building commission, but it now has to be given a more concrete and, above all, operational remit."
"The European Union is ambitious in the field of economic relations, as I have just said."
"The next EU Presidency – our Presidency will be over by then – will advise you of the results of this summit."
"I am confident that the strong revival in transatlantic relations, achieved during the visit of President Bush, can continue during this summit and that we can achieve solid results which will place the future of these transatlantic relations, a vital pillar for the European Union, on a sounder footing."
". Honourable Members, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address Parliament shortly before our yearly EU-US summit, which will take place in Washington on 20 June."
"I would like to say at the outset that we share many of the views expressed in your motion for a resolution and welcome the support of the European Parliament for the strengthening of transatlantic relations."
"Transatlantic relations are at a turning point."
"We are witnessing a new era of transatlantic unity."
"This was most recently confirmed by the Condoleezza Rice, when she said that, rather than sitting back and analysing the state of the transatlantic alliance, we are putting the alliance to work."
"This is a timely and welcome development."
"As global partners, the EU and the United States must take the lead in building a prosperous and safe world and in promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"We must work together to forge a common strategy to deal with global problems wherever possible."
"That is the message our leaders will doubtless seek to convey at the upcoming June summit."
"President Bush’s successful visit to Brussels last February was a sign of the United States Administration’s desire to reach out to Europe and work together in partnership with the European Union."
"It was an important signal that we have put the problems of approach that arose over Iraq behind us and that we are ready to work together in a constructive manner as allies."
"The United States is increasingly adopting a more open attitude to the European Union and listening more carefully to our concerns."
"Even where there are differences between us, we are learning how best to talk through them."
"A good example is the recently launched European Union-US Strategic Dialogue on East Asia, a forum in which to discuss the security challenges in the region, including those related to the rise of China."
"Coordination also continues on United Nations reform, though much work still needs to be done."
"The EU-US summit on 20 June will focus on three global themes: promoting democratic governance and human rights around the world, increasing economic prosperity for our citizens and championing security and development."
"I would like to say a few words on each."
"Promoting democracy and freedom is the essence of President Bush’s foreign policy in his second term."
"European Union foreign policy, which is firmly based on the principles of the United Nations and the European Security Strategy, also aims to promote democracy, together with human rights and the rule of law."
"The promotion of democracy remains key in the wider Middle East and in the Mediterranean region, where transatlantic cooperation has increased substantially over the past 12 months."
"Shortly after our summit in Washington, we and the United States will co-host an international conference in Brussels on Iraq."
"This is an important signal of unified international support for the government and people in their difficult task of working towards stabilisation and reconstruction."
"In addition we have been in daily contact over Lebanon’s election process, and together we will continue to support the Lebanese people as they consolidate democracy."
"In Israel and Palestine, our cooperative approach within the Quartet is also intensifying."
"On economic prosperity, the European Union and the United States have the most integrated economies in the world and benefit from the largest trade and investment relationship."
"But we can do more, and we want to."
"To move this agenda forward, we have spent nine months consulting all stakeholders on the obstacles they encountered and distilled the result in the recently published Commission communication, ‘A stronger EU-US Partnership and a more open market for the 21st century’."
"The communication contains a set of pragmatic proposals for boosting EU-US trade and investment and thus promoting competitiveness, growth, and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic."
"There are three basic strands to our proposals."
"First, regulating the transatlantic market, including areas such as services, investment, procurement and competition; second, promoting knowledge and innovation; and third, instituting smarter and safer borders for swifter trade and investment."
"In the field of regulatory cooperation, the idea is to find ways for regulators to engage with each other at an early stage to avoid unnecessary conflicts and costs, and to promote convergence."
"The second strand, on promoting knowledge and innovation, is crucial for generating economic growth and jobs."
"New technologies, in particular e-commerce, Internet governance and mobile telecommunication services, generated considerable interest amongst the stakeholders consulted."
"The third strand of our package is striking the right balance between heightened security requirements and the continuation of open trade and passenger transport."
"Our communication also addresses the overall structure and goals of transatlantic relations."
"The question we address is what the political profile of our relations should be 10 years after the signature of the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda and fifteen years after the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration."
"In essence, we must make sure that the structure and the goals of transatlantic relations are adapted to today’s challenges."
"We would also like to see legislators – the European Parliament and United States Congress – build stronger ties."
"For this reason we suggest enhancing the Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue and making it a fully-fledged transatlantic assembly."
"The Commission stands ready to assist as necessary, but an initiative of this nature naturally has to come first and foremost from this House and from the United States Congress."
"Championing security and development is the third theme of the summit."
"As we continue to identify measures to enhance the security of our citizens against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is worth remembering that such phenomena have claimed many more victims beyond our borders than within them."
"This reinforces our determination to work with the United States to spread the benefits of security in all its facets and to help release peoples everywhere from the daily tyranny of terrorism and violence."
"The European Union and the United States should combine skills and experience in the field of conflict prevention and crisis response and bring to bear the full range of civilian and military tools at our disposal."
"We should consult routinely on current and potential crises."
"We should strengthen cooperation in post-conflict assistance and reconstruction."
"We should prepare, through joint training and exercises, and we should work together to improve international capacities to respond to crises and to prevent future crises from erupting."
"The European Union is anxious to cooperate with the United States on crisis management, both civilian and military."
"We also recognise the need to tackle poverty, disease, corruption and instability, which terrorists seek to exploit and intensify."
"Our common agenda should prioritise the Millennium Development Goals."
"In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the Parliament’s motion for a resolution and, as I have indicated previously, we largely agree with it."
"We are taking an ambitious, forward-looking approach in developing our relations with the United States and are working actively in the areas mentioned in the draft resolution."
"We have a challenging agenda in front of us."
"We are looking forward to your support, and the support of United States Congress, to accomplish it."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, at a time like the present, when this European Union of ours is weakened, I believe that we have to make clear what great importance we attach to transatlantic relationships, the improvement of which does, in many ways, help us in turn to manifest more clearly our capacity for action."
"What makes the summit so very significant is that it resolves certain issues at the same time as setting certain processes in motion."
"On economic issues, solutions must be found, and agreements reached, with greater speed, for the two great democracies on opposite sides of the Atlantic are still, economically speaking, the world’s great powers."
"If they are capable of stimulating growth – and it is very important that they should, from the point of view of combating unemployment and improving the global situation as a whole – then they should do so within the bounds of a multilateral framework."
"That is important not least in terms of the overall political situation."
"We know from the unresolved developments in the world, and from the hazards and pressures that they bring, that it is only together that democracies can find solutions to these – not only on the basis of Nato, but also on the basis of what the European Union has come to acquire by way of powers and responsibilities in foreign and security policy, in legal and internal policies, and also in the sphere of economic policy."
"It now remains for us to find a suitable framework for this, one in which we can properly develop this policy in future, and the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement we have proposed can play a crucial part in creating one."
"I was interested to read in the Commission communication that there was no political support for this, apart from in the US Congress and in this House."
"The Commission, though, appears to regard the support for it in both these places as irrelevant."
"After all, consideration should be given to whether we might now be able to take a bold step forwards, and, instead of seeking the solution in the detail, mandating the Summit to examine, over the next 12 months, ways in which we can make progress in these areas."
"The Americans have treaties with almost everyone on the face of the earth, as does the European Union, but there is no treaty between the United States and the European Union."
"We should give some thought to the possibility of concluding one, thereby putting things on a better footing, instead of spending 30 years in the belief that the Airbus/Boeing dispute was at the heart of all we did and said."
". Mr President, we too are hopeful that the European Union, despite the uncertainty about the future of the Constitutional Treaty resulting from the ‘no’ votes in the Netherlands and France, will be able to stand united before the United States at the next Summit."
"The world has not ground to a halt and some of the issues, in respect of which it is essential that the United States and the European Union reach agreement, cannot wait until our internal problems have been resolved."
"Although there is no denying that the atmosphere between the United States and Europe has improved, that does not mean that all conflicts are in the past."
"The EU must ensure that it manages to put across its issues to the US."
"The joint resolution that we will be adopting tomorrow contains a whole list of things that we believe should be on the agenda."
"I should like to single out three of them."
"First of all, there is the question of how to deal with globalisation."
"Although it is impossible to sum up the debate on this subject in two minutes, it is clear that the joint economic weight of the European Union and the United States has given both of us influence and great responsibility."
"How can we incorporate the issues surrounding fair trade, the environment and a more social dimension into our position on economic globalisation?"
"Secondly, I am deeply worried about the spread of nuclear arms technology following the failure of the conference to review the non-proliferation Treaty."
"In essence, despite lengthy and careful preparations, the participating countries failed to reach agreement, not least because of the line taken by the Americans."
"It is possible that the Treaty, the legal basis for the non-proliferation regime, and therefore a , has been considerably weakened, the implications of which cannot be overlooked."
"I would therefore call on the EU Member States and the US to table measures that can help restore confidence in the non-proliferation Treaty as a matter of urgency."
"Closely related to this is, thirdly, the UN’s reform which will be debated in the autumn."
"I am pleased to establish that the President of the Council is aware of the importance of this agenda item."
"Although the need for reforms is being felt generally, the position of the United States is as yet unclear."
"I consider this agenda item to be a test of American views about the multilateral system and even about the future of the UN system as a whole."
"I sincerely hope that the European Union will receive promises of a constructive US position."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following a depression during the previous EU legislature and the previous US administration, the skies over the Atlantic Ocean seem to be brightening up."
"President Bush’s visit to the EU and a number of Member States seems to be heralding a new era."
"Needless to say, we would have been keen to welcome President Bush to this Chamber, but we have not given up hope of this happening yet."
"More importantly, though, we seem to be united in terms of conditions to put an end to a difficult time in EU-US relations and to lay the foundations for renewed cooperation that must be based on mutual respect, equivalence and the determination to frame our joint efforts in the multilateral perspective of the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and NATO."
"It goes without saying that unilateral initiatives that could lead to trade conflicts must be avoided."
"The fact that we have entered a time of reflection and possible review after the referenda in France and the Netherlands must not be allowed to adversely affect the proceedings of the forthcoming Summit."
"Ten years after the new transatlantic dialogue was laid down, it is high time we expanded it."
"This expanded dialogue must also leave room for us to express our concerns about the unacceptable conditions in the prison of Guantanamo Bay or about the restriction of personal freedom and privacy that can be the result of unilateral security initiatives."
"Both the US and we set great store by the worldwide spread of democracy, prosperity and human rights, although our views of how that should be done can differ."
"That does not mean that ours are inferior."
"Facing, as we are, enormous challenges in terms of world poverty reduction, combating fatal diseases, peace in the Middle East, a peaceful settlement to the so-called frozen conflicts, I hope that both the Americans and the Europeans will be able to join forces effectively."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group, too, is glad that, after the ice age that temporarily characterised transatlantic relations, things are evidently now being put back on the right track."
"I think that the partners on opposite sides of the Atlantic have to understand just how very much they need each other if the values they share are to be defended and caused to prevail throughout the world."
"This means that the transatlantic summit is very important, for it will – it is to be hoped – help us to make progress."
"I would also like to say how glad I am that our American friends have not, following the failure of the EU’s Constitution to gain acceptance in France and the Netherlands, shown any pleasure in our misfortune."
"I am sure that many of us expected a different reaction, and that this is something we have to regard as a good sign."
"There are, nevertheless, a number of defects in the motion for a resolution as presented, and it is for that reason that my group has tabled amendments to it, which I would now – briefly – like to present."
"One area they touch on is that of climate change."
"Only today, we read in the news reports that not even Tony Blair has managed to get the United States to make concessions where climate change is concerned; our American friends are still, lamentably, blocking the way to effective protection against climate change, at a time when we are becoming aware of just how strong the connection is between combating poverty on the one hand and protecting against climate change on the other."
"Finally, let me turn to human rights and international law."
"In the US, Senator Biden has yet again highlighted how important it is in terms of our American friends’ public image that the prisoner of war camp in Guantánamo should be closed down."
"Just now, we have again been reading about the mutiny of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib."
"Both these camps, along with other illegal camps around the world, must be closed down as a matter of urgency, for they are a disgrace that flies in the face of the United States’ values."
"If we want to combat poverty, I see it as very, very important that we should not revert to competing to see who can invest most in armaments."
"Rather than allowing our age to be characterised by the setting of new records in spending on rearmament, we must do everything we can to discharge our responsibility to the world at large."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the Council report, the Commission report and also the motion put forward by the majority of the political Groups are all aimed at seeking agreement with the United States at any cost, even by removing principles that have always underpinned the foundations of the European Union."
"I am talking about respect for human rights, for instance: the Guantanamo affair is not an isolated case, as demonstrated, for example, by the Abu Ghraib situation – which absolutely no one has mentioned – and the kidnapping of free citizens, as documented by the major European newspapers, which was carried out by the US Secret Service on European Union soil."
"We do not see anything and we do not say anything at all on the matter."
"There is also no mention of condemning preventative war, which is completely at odds with international law."
"Building transatlantic relations is achieved, moreover, by continually paying tribute to all forms of liberalism, and even – I heard it said by the Commission representative – by proposing to put services on the market of transatlantic relations, which up to now – fortunately – have been excluded from International Trade Organisation agreements and are still considered to be services for accessing rights, and not goods for generating profits."
"Mr President, as the Council only knows too well, the European Parliament remains opposed to its intention to abandon the arms embargo in respect of the People’s Republic of China on the basis of the human rights situation, see paragraph 7 of the joint draft resolution."
"Although I support this position, it is too restricted because it completely overlooks the eroding military balance in the state of Taiwan as well as the general regional stability in East Asia."
"These are geopolitical developments which give the US cause for concern about a possible European lifting of the arms embargo against Peking."
"If, as appears to be the case, Brussels wants to give Washington sole and short-term responsibility for peace and security in the Far East, then a fresh crisis in transatlantic relations is looming in the distance in succession to Iraq."
"I hope that at the EU-US Summit on 20 June, the Council will prove this sombre scenario wrong."
"How can it do this?"
"It can do it by joining with the Americans in taking responsibility, in taking real responsibility for geopolitical stability in Asia."
"After all, as China’s key trading partner, the European Union ultimately owes it to itself to do this."
". Mr President, the main basis for the EU’s relations with the United States should be healthy economic competition."
"The European Union will only reap the rewards of such competition if the European economy is not held back by various curious notions relating to the state, society and taxation."
"Similarly, we will only reap the rewards of cooperation with the United States if cooperation is based on a US-friendly foreign policy."
"The United States acts as a stabilising force in global politics."
"Without it, the world would turn into one great battlefield."
"Anti-American sentiments, which are expressed particularly frequently by French politicians, are not conducive to neighbourly relations between Europe and the United States."
"Two years ago, President Chirac told the countries supporting US intervention in Iraq that they had missed a good opportunity to shut up."
"Now that President Chirac and his predecessor, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, have plunged Europe into utter confusion as a result of premature support for the Constitution, thus shattering the vision of future common European policies, we in turn can say to the French President that he has missed a good opportunity to shut up, or, in his native tongue, ‘’"
"Mr President, we have talked about transatlantic relations many times in the past."
"There was a debate only last January, which was followed by a resolution, and we now have a Euro-Atlantic Summit in Washington at the end of June, to name but a few. That is all useful and interesting of course, but there is still room for improvement in those relations, primarily by way of a change of mentality."
"For example, we are all agreed that the fight against terrorism on the one hand, and the promotion of democracy and peace in the world on the other, can only be successful if our partnership with the United States is reinforced, based on the western values we share."
"When it comes to translating the principles into practice, though, things invariably go wrong."
"A perfect example is the European Council’s intention to remove the arms embargo against China."
"The US’s opposition to those plans is entirely appropriate."
"There is absolutely no point in paying lip service to democratisation in the rest of the world if, in practice, we do exactly the opposite by accommodating the wishes of a Chinese regime that is still as dictatorial as in the days when it crushed the protests on Tiananmen Square."
"We as Europeans should therefore search our own hearts from time to time."
"In this part-session, I have heard the situation in Guantanamo Bay being discussed in various debates."
"Far be it from me to deny that we have a problem there, but constantly harping on about this issue does, however, reveal a certain level of hypocrisy on our part, certainly if we take the European shortcomings in fighting terrorism into consideration."
"We can only be delighted about the positive outcome of the subsequent visits of President Bush and Condoleezza Rice to Europe."
"We must continue on this path, but if we talk about respect, then that respect should be mutual."
"– I should like to begin by congratulating the authors of the report on achieving a rare feat: they have drawn up a document that might prove very useful for the Washington Summit of 20 June."
"I should also like to raise two points."
"First, I should like to point out that, during the cold war, Europe was the theatre of strategic operations and that the perception of threats was the same on both sides of the Atlantic. This changed after the end of the cold war, German reunification, the collapse of the Soviet Union and 11 September."
"The theatres of strategic operations have changed, but the real difference is in the perception of threats on both sides of the Atlantic; and if the perception of threats has changed, then so too must the strategies and operating methods."
"Whereas in Europe we have developed a multilateral concept of soft power, in other words diplomacy, economic sanctions and political sanctions, the United States has become more inclined, after 11 September, towards hard power, namely the idea of unilateralism and of ‘with others if possible, by ourselves if necessary’."
"The two concepts and perceptions of threat on either side of the Atlantic have thus grown apart."
"Attempts are ongoing to strike a balance whereby soft power becomes less soft and hard power less hard, and, more importantly, the perception of threats and the means of combating those threats are consistent and complementary."
"This is the key objective of any transatlantic summit."
"There is a second objective, which concerns the area of trade, both on a bilateral level, but also in particular with regard to its concerted attack in the area of globalisation and the World Trade Organisation."
"It is appalling that social dumping and environmental dumping, which jeopardise jobs in Europe and are at the heart of unfair competition, can be allowed to continue unchecked in the world and to continue to act to our detriment."
"Unless the EU and the United States can join forces on this issue, it will be very difficult to prevent this from happening, and the consequence will sooner or later be a form of protectionism that will itself be unbridled."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are, primarily, two things at issue here."
"One is the need for the United States of America, and Europe, to use the wealth they have created to help those less well-off to achieve similar prosperity."
"I believe that the British Presidency is planning to do something about this shortly, and we can play our part in it, even though we may disagree about one thing or another."
"We also need, not only to take pride in the democracy and freedom that we have established in our own countries, but also to offer them to others as instruments of development."
"I quite deliberately say ‘offer’ rather than ‘impose’, for offering is what we have done in Europe itself, in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans – which I mention because I have just been told that a large party of visitors from Macedonia is present – and it is surely what we intend to do in the Middle East as well."
"We regard the Middle East as a very unstable region and a very important one."
"We, Americans and Europeans alike, agree that everyone who lives in these countries needs democracy and development – free development in particular – as a means towards peace."
"This makes it particularly important that Europe and the USA should cooperate with one another."
"Let me reiterate, though, that the approach to be adopted must be that of enabling people to establish freedom and democracy in their own countries, without feeling that these have been imposed upon them."
"It is also important – and here I would cite Iran as an example – that we join together in preventing new dangers and new risks from rearing their heads."
"Here, too, though, I would strongly advocate doing this, not by way of threats, but through negotiations, thereby, I hope, arriving at something we can all regard as a success."
"Mr President, it is indeed good to hear the Council and the Commission restate so firmly the European Union commitment to renewing transatlantic cooperation."
"There are many areas of work in which the shared values of both partners directly coincide."
"The United States of America has recently taken the lead in openly encouraging the establishment of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula."
"The European Union has set up the unique Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quieter, in-depth work, helping to establish the rule of law and rights-based legislation in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean."
"Dialogue between these two key actors is not enough."
"Our whole world is now riven by conflict and insecurity, from weapons of mass destruction, which sadly do exist, to the continued act of genocide in different countries."
"Our citizens and the world’s citizens are in danger."
"Full-scale cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America, as well as with other key democracies such as India, is a prerequisite for peace."
"Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism, terrorism and more terrorism, democracy and common values; it is always these same phrases that we hear in relation to our big brother observing us from across the Atlantic and from space, monitoring us from bases in Germany, Italy, Hungary and Turkey, from African, Asian and Latin American countries, from nuclear submarines, from pilotless aircraft and from who knows where else."
"We should therefore start work on a resolution on mutually beneficial, balanced and forward-looking relations."
"We must beware of sensitive topics, however."
"Inhumane and degrading conditions in certain US prisons must be kept secret."
"It is essential to make loud declarations of cooperation in the war on terror and bioterrorism and to attempt to uncover the sources of funding for terrorism."
"What do we not mention in our resolution?"
"The sources of modern arms for terrorist organisations, cooperation in removing nuclear weapons from the Middle East and ending support for terrorists in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Western and Central Africa."
"It is certainly no easy matter to tell a stronger partner one’s views openly and clearly."
"We may criticise Turkey and Russia, however, and perhaps even Bangladesh."
"You will undoubtedly be aware that literacy and universal health insurance are among the values of European civilisation."
"What a shame that our partner does not recognise the same values."
"Which of you, ladies and gentlemen, will propose these common values in the next resolution?"
"Do you not know that illiteracy affects millions across the pond, and that universal health insurance has yet to be successfully introduced?"
"According to public domain research, thermonuclear fusion is an ordinary task for civilisation, which should be resolved together."
"If we are allies, let us not shrink from pointing out these tasks and encouraging our partner to resolve them."
"Mr President, the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which we recently commemorated, reminded us of the historical significance of the assistance we received from the United States."
"At the time Europe was weak in both economic and military terms, and without such assistance it would have been unable to defeat the Nazis or to put up at least partial opposition to the Communist dictatorship."
"As things stand today, the EU is incapable of ensuring its own security unless it engages in military and political cooperation with the United States."
"Instances in the past when we joined forces, excellent examples of which include Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and, more recently, Afghanistan, should serve as a blueprint for our future military and political cooperation."
"The significance of this cooperation is plain to see in Central and Eastern Europe, and NATO enlargement is proof that this region is regarded as a credible partner."
"A sense of security is particularly important for countries whose history has been one of great suffering, such as Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland."
"These countries were deprived of their sovereignty for many decades because they had no partner prepared to perform the duties of an ally without hesitation."
"Economic cooperation is of course an inherent feature of harmonious political cooperation."
"It is in Europe’s vital interests to prevent an economic war with the United States, and after all we are currently the two largest trade partners in the world."
"This should be the line taken by Parliament in the run-up to the June summit, and we should send out a clear message that our policy is underpinned by credible partners who share our values."
"Mr President, I do not intend to follow Mr Kohlíček’s example and discuss illiteracy in the USA, or to dwell on the fact that America has a dubious track record on certain issues."
"Instead, what I want to say is that Europe and America belong to the same family."
"Members of the same family often have differing opinions, but a family should always put up a united front."
"Our opinions on Iraq may well differ, and indeed they do, but in strategic terms we are allies."
"Hysterical anti-Americanism is not in Europe’s interest, and it is not in the interest of the USA to treat Europe like a younger brother."
"There are two tasks facing us today that we must tackle together."
"The first of these is the fight against terrorism, and the second is the peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict."
"We must not forget that Asia is gaining ever more importance as a political and economic power in the shadow of the bizarre rivalry between America and Europe, and the conclusions we should draw from this are as follows. Instead of waging a nonsensical economic war, what is needed is close cooperation."
"We may well have grounds for complaint about the USA’s economic perfectionism, but we should still be more flexible on economic issues."
"We should never forget the other continents are happiest when they see us fighting."
"I believe that the new EU Member States, and in particular my own country, Poland, will know exactly what I mean."
"Mr President, the atmosphere has changed significantly since the visit of George W. Bush to Brussels a few months ago, but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised."
"It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you could show, when you are in Washington with the Commission, that we can make a real step forward in EU-US relations."
"Clearly there are a whole range of issues of a political and security nature on this agenda to which you have referred, particularly the political challenges dealing with democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you would listen to my contribution, because I would like to draw your attention to one particular issue on the economic side."
"It is through the economics that we must drive this particular relationship."
"That is where the businesses want the remaining barriers to trade and investment to be removed."
"That is where an OECD report released this week shows that if we go for growth and remove these barriers, we could be adding 2 to 3% GDP per capita in Europe as a result."
"I would therefore like the summit to be able to set out an ambitious agenda, a vision of how these remaining obstacles can be reduced and removed, to have a route map, to be able to have a clear timetable so that we would be able not only to stimulate our economies, but to bring Europe and America closer together."
"To do that you are going to need the cooperation of this House."
"You have spoken about the cooperation between this House and that of the US Congress, the significant support in this House for this concept, and also for a broader partnership framework between the United States and Europe."
"It is up to you, to Mr Juncker as President-in-Office of the Council, and to Mr Barroso, to take the leadership and to make sure we do not miss out on this opportunity for a strengthened European-American relationship which will not only be good bilaterally, but will also enable us to face the multilateral global challenges, a relationship without which they will not be resolved."
"Mr President, let me immediately pick up on the point raised by Mr Elles and referred to by my colleague Mr Swoboda, that being that both Europe and the United States bear a great responsibility in global terms and that it is only by acting together that we will enable the less well-off countries to be integrated into the global economy."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on its statement, for it has taken a bold step."
"Politically, we have had a rough ride, and it was for a long time unclear what, if anything, we could achieve in the course of preparations for this summit."
"Written and oral statements have been made, and these take us a step further."
"By these I mean particularly the proposals for cooperation in the negotiation of specific agreements, in the field of new technologies and, most especially, in research and safety."
"All these things are right, proper and important."
"I am especially glad that the Commission has ventured for the first time to use the term ‘transatlantic market’ and also to find a way of describing what it is – still rather cryptically, it has to be admitted, but it is going down the right road."
"This is something that this House has frequently addressed in its resolutions."
"We are very well-advised to acknowledge the reality of what we already have, which is an integrated market."
"I might add that the OECD study to which Mr Elles referred not only says that we will achieve growth if we press on with integrating the market only within Europe – from which, according to the study, Europe will derive greater benefit than the United States – it also says that we must do this throughout the world, which is an extremely important point."
"If we benefit from this, then the other countries will do likewise, and so we should take very careful note of what this study has to say."
"I would, though, like to congratulate the Commission on the study it initiated."
"It is a good job of work and will enable us to make progress."
"Now for my last point: here, too, we see the Commission taking on board a proposal from this House; in this instance, that we should work together more closely in the sphere of inter-parliamentary exchange."
"Mr Jonathan Evans will be saying more about that later."
"It is an important point, and I propose that we should have further discussions of everything the Commission is proposing – which the Summit will, I hope, take on board – in an inter-parliamentary context."
"Mr President, we are seeing real improvements in the climate of cooperation between Europe and America, which is good news for those of us in Europe who are friends of America."
"One can only hope that the good news will continue."
"There are further hurdles to overcome, however."
"One of the most significant obstacles we are currently facing is the restrictions on entry into the United States imposed on the citizens of certain EU Member States, or in other words visa restrictions."
"Many people in Europe regard practices of this kind as discriminatory, not least because they amount to unequal treatment of EU Member States."
"This view is particularly widespread among the public in countries such as my own, Poland, and the other Central European countries whose citizens continue to need visas to enter the United States."
"I would also remind the House that the changes we recently made to the reciprocity mechanism mean that the EU’s visa policy is coordinated at Community level."
"It is now the Commission, and not the Member States or the Council, which takes the decision to impose sanctions on a third country."
"It is therefore also the Commission’s duty to ensure that all citizens and all EU Member States enjoy equal rights."
"I hope that this issue will be raised during the forthcoming summit."
"The second issue I should like to address is the need for cooperation between the European Union and the United States in support of democracy and human rights, in particular in the post-Soviet space."
"Europe and America must speak with one voice on this issue, as they did during the Orange Revolution or when Dr Condoleezza Rice and Mr Solana made their recent declaration on support for the Belarussian opposition."
"Words are not enough, however, and what is needed is joint action."
"It is an unfortunate fact that Europe is lagging behind America in this respect."
"We are less flexible than the Americans and too slow and bureaucratic in the way we take action."
"This is particularly true in the case of the Commission."
"I believe that our attention should be focused on ensuring that the European Union and America speak with one voice and take joint action on issues relating to the promotion of democracy and human rights."
"Mr President, one of the most important aspects of transatlantic relations is the European Union’s cooperation with the United States in support of democracy and human rights throughout the world."
"The resurgence of democracy we are seeing in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa means that the European Union and the USA must coordinate their action to promote democratic values, to monitor free elections, to encourage the formation of political parties, trade unions and independent civil society organisations and to defend the freedom of the media."
"In this new global era, we need a new vision of an international political order based on democracy and human rights."
"At this moment in time, both the United States and the European Union must avoid a repeat of the genocide and ethnic cleansing that has taken place before the eyes of the whole world."
"A new agreement is needed to achieve this goal."
"Its aim should be to bring about closer cooperation between the European Union and the United States in support of freedom, peace and security."
"Wherever necessary, it should also provide for joint preventive action to forestall humanitarian or environmental disasters."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our resolution echoes the United Nations’ Millennium objectives."
"The United States and the European Union are jointly committed to implementing this vital programme to reduce world poverty."
"The US and the European Union co-manage the Bretton Woods institutions."
"This shared responsibility is based, in particular, on that tradition, that tacit agreement which allocates management responsibility for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to Europe and the US respectively."
"We should not forget that the IMF was created to preserve the stability of the international monetary system."
"It has a very different role today."
"All developing countries are effectively dependent on the IMF, on its loans and its benevolence, for the finance needed for their sustainable development."
"We cannot ignore the outcome of this policy."
"Apart from the fact that the IMF has partly failed in its role of monitoring global economic stability by failing to anticipate – or indeed by actually provoking – a number of regional and international financial crises, we need to assess with the US the negative impact of the conditions, based on the Washington consensus, which the IMF imposes on countries requesting its assistance."
"Finally, in the area of global reform of the multilateral system, the agenda for the transatlantic discussions should also include the return of the Bretton Woods institutions into the United Nations system."
"Mr President, the debate has shown that there are numerous challenges to be faced, jointly and with solidarity, by the US and the European Union."
"We also know that there are still many problems in defining better-coordinated positions."
"These have been mentioned."
"With regard to global warming, our positions are still a long way apart and we know that, without the US, the Kyoto agreement is doomed to failure."
"This is therefore something to be discussed with the Americans, with the aim of finally getting them to share this multilateral approach to global warming."
"Reform of the United Nations system is another thorny issue, and no true UN reform is possible without US support."
"In terms of development policy – as we have already heard, in part, in relation to the Bretton Woods institutions – the Americans, with the Europeans, can really change course and move towards the Millennium objectives in order to generate a new momentum."
"A lot of work still has to be done in all these areas."
"However, we have made considerable progress in dealing with major crises and serious international problems such as the Middle East, Iran or Sudan."
"These are all areas where progress has been made through joint action by Europe and the US in searching for solutions."
"I also noted a remark made by many of you that we should, nonetheless, perhaps be thinking about developing the framework for transatlantic relations."
"It is slightly curious that two partners who, in principle, are so close to one another, do not have a framework, but rather, in practice, base their relations and cooperation on a mere declaration."
"Is this possibly because they such close partners?"
"That is perhaps a point worth further reflection."
"However, I believe that in future we must seriously consider whether it is time to provide a more precise and defined framework for transatlantic relations."
"In any event, it is clear from your debates that the forthcoming summit is an important meeting, a meeting which must consolidate the progress made, which must continue to develop our relations in those areas where we have so far been unable to find common ground, and which must also cement the improvement in transatlantic relations which we have seen since the start of this year."
"The Luxembourg Presidency, in any event, attaches great importance to this summit and we are very keen for it to be a success – a success for Europe."
"This is important because Europe also has to prove to the Americans that it is still capable of action and that internal problems are not restricting its ability to act in the international arena."
". Mr President, as I have said before, there is a reinvigorated willingness to strengthen EU-US relations."
"This stems from both sides of the Atlantic."
"In the political field we have seen cooperation on issues dealing with Iraq, Iran, Sudan, the southern Caucasus, Central Asia and Belarus, not to mention the broader Middle East and the Mediterranean."
"On the economic front, much is in place already, but clearly more can be done and we are working together to move in that direction."
"It is true that difficulties arise in the field of trade, but it is also true that our difficulties can hopefully be solved more frequently through dialogue."
"With regard to the Boeing-Airbus issue, it is unfortunate that last week the United States decided to leave the negotiating table and request a formal dispute settlement procedure in the WTO in respect of alleged subsidies provided to Airbus."
"In turn, we decided to resume action in the WTO on the subsidies given to Boeing."
"Commissioner Mandelson’s preferred solution since he took up office last November has been to settle the dispute through negotiations."
"A negotiated solution may still eventually be reached following the WTO rulings, but at this point in time the Commission has to protect the interests of Airbus against Boeing."
"Despite the regrettable escalation of this dispute, I am confident that recent developments will not affect our bilateral and multilateral cooperation."
"On the issue of security measures, both the EU and the US have taken many steps to increase security."
"However, we must try to minimise their impact on trade and travel by developing global security standards and enhancing our customs cooperation."
"At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her explicit support for the Commission’s communication and the study on EU-US relations which we commissioned."
"On your repeated call for a transatlantic market to be completed by 2015, the Commission very much shares the objective of further enhancing our already flourishing bilateral EU-US economic relationship."
"Indeed, through the 1998 transatlantic economic partnership and the 2002 positive economic agenda, the Commission has been pursuing the same goal, i.e. identifying and possibly eliminating obstacles, particularly in the field of regulations, and ensuring the smooth functioning of this relationship."
"Equally, the recently published communication aims to boost EU-US trade and investment, and the creation of a regulatory cooperation forum foreseen by the communication would address regulatory obstacles."
"A transatlantic market is already an economic reality, while the elimination of obstacles to trade and investment is an incremental process and we are taking steps in that direction."
"On globalisation, we intend to commit ourselves to concluding the Doha Development Round Agenda within the next 12 months at the EU-US summit."
"On visas for the citizens of the ten Member States not benefiting from the US visa-waiver programme, I can assure you that we are continuing to urge the US at all levels to recognise the new economic, social and political realities in the ten Member States which acceded to the European Union last year and which should be treated the same as the other Member States."
"We welcome in this context the new US visa roadmap for Poland and the planned extension to the other Member States which joined at the last enlargement."
"This is an important step in the right direction."
"On climate change, we are negotiating with the US on an environment declaration."
"We would like to see a substantial commitment to working towards a long-term international regime on climate change post-2012."
"We will, therefore, be working to relaunch a high-level EU-US dialogue on the environment."
"With regard to your call for an EU-US partnership agreement, I acknowledge that we maintain Treaty relations with the majority of third countries around the globe, yet have no such treaty with our most important partner."
"Because we already have solid cooperation, we do not see a need for a transatlantic agreement that would involve long formal negotiations without changing much in substance."
"It needs also to be stressed that the transatlantic difficulties of the past were political and not institutional in nature."
"The elaboration and defence of consistent EU positions vis-à-vis the US do not depend on the existence of a treaty-based structure."
"That being said, there is a strong case for reviewing our existing structures and revamping and modernising the new transatlantic agenda of 1995 to adapt it to current needs."
"Finally, and in conclusion, I should like to underline again that you are fundamental actors in this strategic alliance and we rely on your support to implement our common agenda."
"The communication encourages the setting up of a transatlantic assembly."
"Such an assembly could be held in conjunction with the summit."
"I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Uzbekistan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Uzbekistan remains extremely serious, with President Karimov continuing to reject calls for an international inquiry into the recent tragic events."
"According to the various reports, over 500 Uzbek refugees are still in Kyrgyzstan."
"The European Union’s efforts are currently focused on two aims, namely to put pressure on President Karimov for an international inquiry, and to assist the refugees in Kyrgyzstan."
"In the longer term, however, we cannot neglect the need to promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the region, as well as to push ahead with internal reforms in Uzbekistan."
"At the start of the events in Andijan, the Presidency published a statement, dated 14 May 2005, expressing serious concern at the situation and inviting the parties to refrain from violence and to find a peaceful solution."
"The Council followed developments in Uzbekistan closely and discussed this issue at the highest level."
"On 23 May 2005, it adopted conclusions on the situation in eastern Uzbekistan."
"These conclusions sent an urgent, clear and relevant message to the Uzbek authorities."
"The Council expressed its grave concern at the latest developments in eastern Uzbekistan and roundly condemned the excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces."
"The Council urged the Uzbek authorities to comply with their international obligations in terms of democracy, the rule of law and human rights."
"It also invited them to allow the humanitarian agencies and other international organisations immediate and unfettered access to the region concerned."
"Additionally, the Council stressed the need to deal with the underlying causes of instability in the country through in-depth internal reforms to be implemented by the Uzbek authorities."
"The Council will coordinate its action with the OSCE and other members of the international community such as the Russian Federation and the USA, in order to provide its support to the reform process."
"The Council’s message to the Uzbek authorities is therefore clear: we stand ready to help you, but only if a peaceful and lasting solution can be found to the present situation, and if internal reforms are implemented to deal with the deeper causes of the country’s instability."
"On 1 June 2005, the local British presidency in Tashkent approached the Uzbek Foreign Minister, Mr Ganiev, asking him to request the Uzbek authorities to reconsider their rejection of an independent international inquiry and to draw his attention to the country’s international obligations."
"The invitation by the Uzbek authorities to EU ambassadors resident in Tashkent to observe the national investigation into the events in Andijan, an inquiry to be conducted by the Public Prosecutor and the Uzbek Parliament, is not acceptable as a valid alternative to an independent international inquiry."
"The Secretary-General/High Representative, Mr Solana, decided to send his personal representative on human rights, Mr Matthiessen, to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan."
"His mission had to be aborted because the Uzbek authorities refused to grant him a visa."
"The Council views this episode as a very disappointing – indeed worrying – development in relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan."
"Despite President Karimov’s continuing refusal to demands for an independent international inquiry into events in Andijan, the Council will continue to insist and, in conjunction with the OSCE, the UN and other international organisations will coordinate the operational procedures for such an inquiry, in the event that the Uzbek authorities reconsider their decision."
"The Council will take appropriate measures in the light of the reply from the Uzbek authorities and the results of the possible inquiry."
". Mr President, the Commission fully subscribes to the Council declaration which clearly and unambiguously sets out our concerns over recent events in Uzbekistan."
"We have been shocked by the appalling loss of life."
"We are concerned by the resulting movements of people away from the violence over the border with Kyrgyzstan and by the reported excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces."
"It is clear to the Commission that the people of Uzbekistan urgently need to work towards a peaceful and sustainable solution to the present situation."
"The Commission notes the suggestion made by the Uzbek authorities in relation to the international inquiry contained in the letter of 31 May from President Karimov to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a copy of which was sent to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"It is essential that the Uzbek authorities immediately allow a full independent international inquiry into the recent events."
"The Commission considers it important that dialogue is maintained and that it is possible for diplomatic envoys to transmit messages to Uzbekistan."
"Even before the shocking recent events, the Commission was working to bolster Uzbekistan’s fragile reform process."
"We have to be realistic about what can be achieved, but I believe that working, for example, with the Uzbek Parliament to help create a modern legislature is crucial to improving the lot of the Uzbek people."
"What we have seen in Uzbekistan in recent weeks, following the events in Andijan – not only the appalling loss of life, but the response by the authorities to international criticism and the reported crack-down on human rights groups and defenders – only underlines how important it is to keep the reform process alive."
"This would be the worst possible moment to pull out or to isolate the country."
"At the same time, however, this does not mean business as usual."
"The Commission has already sent a delegation of officials to Uzbekistan to investigate what more we can do to support reforms and importantly, to improve living conditions in the Fergana Valley."
"In the coming weeks, we shall be finalising our proposals to be implemented under the TACIS programme."
"Our existing poverty reduction programme for the Fergana Valley works in all three countries – Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – amongst which the valley is divided."
"There is some scope within our existing resources to do more and the Commission is determined that the opportunity is not missed."
"In the meantime, we will continue to work to the TACIS technical assistance programme to promote social and economic reforms, both at the governmental and grassroots civil society level."
"While pushing for a fully independent investigation into the events that have already taken place, we must not lose sight of how those who took part in the unrest may yet be treated."
"It is clear that the authorities regard all participation as criminal."
"In this context, the Commission is looking at a range of projects, including improving the management of prisons and treatment of detainees."
"The Commission commends the cooperation between the authorities in Kyrgyzstan – who have been faced with a very difficult humanitarian situation – and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees."
"We therefore welcome the recent decision to relocate the asylum seekers, who currently number 475, away from the border region."
"."
"Mr President, much as I welcome the response from the Council presidency and from Commissioner Borg to the effect that they want to exert more pressure on the Uzbek Government and that they also want to target aid more directly towards Uzbek refugees, that cannot conceal the fact that the explosion of violence and the uprising in Uzbekistan are the result of a mixture of abject poverty, heavy political pressure on the part of the state and Muslim fundamentalism."
"The brutality with which the Uzbek Government has responded is setting the earth smouldering in Uzbekistan."
"In that light, the European Union cannot afford to remain on the fence, for we, including the European Parliament, have a solid relationship with that country."
"After all, we also have a cooperation delegation for Central Asia."
"Every year, the European Union spends EUR 10 million in aid to Uzbekistan, including a sum for the Uzbek parliament."
"In the 2005 budget, I tabled an amendment against this with the intention of freezing part of the budget."
"Unfortunately, the amendment was rejected by a majority of one vote."
"That is odd, since the majority of political parties in Uzbekistan were forbidden to take part in the parliamentary elections."
"What is now needed is for the European Union to exert more pressure to get reforms implemented and the legal structure improved."
"In addition, all aid that passes via the government or parliament should be frozen, for European resources should not be used to fund state repression."
"Civil society and NGOs also need to be supported, and the freedom of the press and religion guaranteed, for it is too crazy for words that churches, among others, should be obstructed and harassed despite being completely unconnected with religious fundamentalism, let alone terrorism or anything else."
"In the long run, the political pressure will need to lead to more political freedom and fresh elections."
"This is essential, for Uzbekistan, albeit still a poverty-stricken country, has a growing economy."
"It is crucial to stability in the region that economic growth should go hand in hand with true democracy and freedom of expression of opinion."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Parliament’s motion for a resolution, which echoes the Council’s position of 23 and 24 May of this year."
"I shall not revert to the account of recent events in Uzbekistan, but I should like to reaffirm the need for a rapid and determined response by the European Parliament to the extremely serious situation for the local population, and particularly for the refugees."
"In view of the tragic events in Andijan, I would firstly stress the overriding need to set up an international commission of inquiry as soon as possible, to clarify what happened and oblige the Karimov government to face up to its responsibilities."
"Additionally, the Union must act with the NGOs and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that refugees on the Kyrgyzstan border are well treated."
"The European Parliament must also urge Uzbekistan to implement in-depth reforms and put the country on the path to true democracy and economic development for the benefit of all of its citizens."
"The proliferation of arbitrary imprisonment and the use of torture and execution must stop, once and for all."
"Respect for freedom of expression, and freedom of the press, but also freedom of NGOs, are preconditions for the smooth running of our partnership and cooperation agreements."
"I should like to emphasise that the ferment of popular demonstrations and confusion in Uzbekistan is rooted in depressed economic and social conditions, in poverty and in powerlessness in the face of corruption."
"Should we use a stick and carrot approach?"
"If the Tacis programme, with scrupulous monitoring of the allocation of funds, is to continue, we can remind the Karimov government that partnership and cooperation agreements are subject to strict compliance with the clauses on democracy and respect for human rights."
". I will speak now as a member of the ALDE Group and as president of the Central Asia delegation."
"Honourable Members, today I urge you to show your support for a general resolution condemning the particularly violent reprisals undertaken by Uzbek President Islam Karimov [against protesters] in Andijan."
"The President ordered the shooting of people who merely wished for true democracy and real change."
"In actual fact, this is a recurrence of the events at Tiananmen Square, and we must present a fair and adequate evaluation of these events."
"The nations of Central Asia suffer continuous violations of human rights, and restrictions imposed on the activities of the opposition and mass media."
"The development of a civil society in that region is insufficient."
"Uzbekistan is a country with the most stringent authoritarian regime in the region."
"The country lacks an independent and fair system of courts and freedoms of expression and religion; the activities of opposition parties and civil society are prohibited, the freedom of press is banned and reprisals and torture by the militia are widespread."
"Although the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan raises some hopes for a long-term democratic process, the latest events in the Uzbek town of Andijan and the following reactions of neighbouring Central Asian republics are a matter of great concern to us."
"The events in Andijan are the expression of the resistance of the Uzbek nation against oppression."
"The European Parliament cannot stay aloof."
"We need to know what has happened and what is happening now in order for adequate measures to be taken."
"We demand an independent investigation of the events."
"We urge America to renounce the deployment of its military forces in Uzbekistan, which requires huge payments that essentially contribute to the further strengthening of President Karimov’s regime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: the priorities of our Parliament should continue to target the prevention of violence and bloodshed."
"We must spare no efforts in strengthening civil society and the freedom of speech."
". Mr President, Mr Schmit, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 May, insurgents and protesters were on the receiving end of brutal treatment from the Uzbek army."
"The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, having interviewed 50 witnesses, all of whose statements concurred, described the result as ‘a massacre’."
"The extent of the shooting was so enormous and its character so random and disproportionate, that it would not be unreasonable to describe it as butchery."
"I am in total agreement with the remarks of both the Council and the Commission, and certainly with Mr Borg when he says that we cannot continue as if nothing has happened, as if it were ‘business as usual’."
"We in the European Union must give a strong message to this dictatorial and highly authoritarian regime, and so I agree with those Members who insist on more political pressure, on speeding up reforms, on stopping aid from passing via the government or parliament and allowing only grant aid via NGOs; this international enquiry must be mounted, otherwise we cannot simply continue the cooperation and partnership agreement we have concluded with Uzbekistan."
"Mr President, Uzbekistan is the most populated and culturally the richest of the five central Asian post-Soviet newly independent states."
"Uzbekistan has no historic traditions of democracy or good governance, having been ruled in the distant past by Khanates, followed by Tsarists and Soviet Russia, only to find itself unexpectedly a sovereign state in 1991, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union."
"Inevitably the then existing Uzbek nomenclatura filled the power vacuum; hence the composition of the current regime."
"There can be no doubt that President Karimov has ruled in an authoritarian way and human rights abuses have been common, particularly against the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of the then Taliban in Afghanistan but now largely defeated or replaced by the nominally peaceful, although still fundamentalist, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which rather surprisingly has offices in the European Union to gather funds and recruit supporters."
"During the recent debate on the Coveney human rights report, I tried to strike a balance between the stick of Uzbekistan-bashing and the carrot of more dialogue with the Uzbek President if he continues to cooperate with fighting international terrorism and delivers on his commitment to give independence to the judiciary, freedom to the press and punishment to those responsible for torture and human rights abuses."
"Sadly, no sooner had we adopted this report than the Andizhan tragedy occurred."
"The full story is still very confused."
"Who were these 23 prisoners bounced out of prison by armed insurgents?"
"Who took civilian hostages to negotiate with the regional governor?"
"Who called the crowds out to protest?"
"And who gave the orders for the troops to shoot innocent protestors?"
"I of course deeply regret Mr Karimov’s refusal of an international inquiry and so I call upon the OSCE to involve the little-known Moscow mechanism last used with Turkmenistan, also an authoritarian regime, to impose an international inquiry and to report with or without Uzbekistan’s consent."
"This method, to my mind, is more likely to produce a result than any other."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I welcomed the Council and Commission statement, I would like to say immediately that, in the joint motion for a resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow, I have found an unacceptable paragraph acknowledging the role carried out by Uzbekistan in the fight against international terrorism."
"I find the very idea that the West and Europe consider Islam Karimov an ally to be genuinely concerning, because no one who uses terrorist methods against his own people can be considered an ally."
"I believe that Parliament and the Commission ought to firmly insist on the creation of an international commission of inquiry that can clarify who was responsible for the massacre."
"I believe that the dispatch of official international observers on the ground should also be called for, with the aim of preventing or, at least, impeding continued acts of repression, opposition arrests, attacks against journalists and terrorist violence of the State against the civilian population."
"Europe has to be able to clearly distinguish itself in the eyes of the Uzbek people, both from the reason of state of the Russian and Chinese Governments, and from the outright cynicism of Washington, which continues to pay out millions of dollars to Karimov in exchange for military bases."
"This is not the first time such tragic events have occurred in Uzbekistan, and we must make every effort to ensure that they will not be repeated."
"If this does not succeed, it could lead to destabilisation not just in Uzbekistan, but also in the wider region of Central Asia."
"Demands for an independent international investigation have already been expressed by the UN through the High Commissioner for Human Rights, by the European Union through its Council and by the OSCE through the Chairman-in-Office of that organisation."
"In this light we can of course merely support the decisions of the European Council."
"The European Union and others that wish to participate in resolving this extraordinarily complex and challenging issue must be entirely clear about the causes, the course and the consequences of these tragic events."
"I believe that alongside the investigation that has been demanded any number of times, there must be a comprehensive analysis of the sources of any further potential destabilisation in Uzbekistan."
"I am convinced that the exceptionally complex state of affairs cannot be attributed simply to terrorism or religious fundamentalism."
"We should not allow ourselves the luxury of superficial diagnosis, since that could lead to mistaken policies."
"Certain other elements of instability have already been mentioned here today."
"What is essential for the European Union is that we should make every effort to ensure that within a democratic framework Uzbekistan can arrive at stability and introduce reforms, which would lead to a simplification of the internal political dialogue and then take the country to a higher level of democracy and economic progress."
"Mr President, it is vital that this country, with its enormous wealth, particularly in terms of gas, should not be destabilised."
"That is not in our, or anyone’s, interest."
"We have to concede that there are fundamentalist elements in that country, but they must not be used as a pretext for keeping the Uzbek people in a straightjacket, because that is precisely what is happening."
"The government of President Karimov uses this spectre, this more or less genuine threat from fundamentalists, as a way of keeping his oppressive regime in power."
"I believe that we must keep up the pressure on the Uzbek Government and on President Karimov."
"We must urge him to accept an international inquiry and clearly show our solidarity."
"From that point of view, the resolution you are about to adopt is important."
"We must make it clear that the European Union will not tolerate the attitudes and policies seen in recent weeks."
"Far from destabilising the country, this solidarity must be a way of stabilising it in order to foster democracy, because that is our aim."
"I believe that no other pretexts, even serious ones, such as the issue of fundamentalism, can prevent us from bringing strong pressure to bear on that government, one of the most dictatorial regimes in the entire region."
". Mr President, we need to remain engaged with the Uzbek authorities if we are to seek reforms in the areas of human rights and democracy."
"The Commission also remains active in the humanitarian situation."
"We are in close contact with the UNHCR in order to have an assessment of the situation with those who have fled to the border area."
"ECHO is monitoring the situation on the ground and, should the need arise, the Commission would be able to quickly mobilise humanitarian assistance."
"As I said in my introductory remarks, we believe that we must remain engaged with TACIS programmes, which deal essentially with democratic and economic reforms, these being at the root of the problems that have arisen."
"The Commission has already allocated EUR 3 million of assistance to the Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory for poverty reduction, cross-border cooperation and avoidance of an escalation of tension in this volatile area."
"We will keep up the pressure on the Uzbek authorities to institute necessary reforms and establish a democratic society."
"We will continue to call for an international inquiry into recent events and to press President Karimov to reconsider his position."
"On the issue of the partnership and cooperation agreement, it is our belief that any suspension of this agreement would only serve to cut off the institutional contacts with the authorities."
"Whilst we are convinced of the need to keep up the pressure on the Uzbek authorities to allow an international investigation and to take real and concrete action in the field of human rights and democracy, we believe that we must remain engaged in a channel of communication in order to remedy the situation effectively."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral questions (B6-0241/2005 and B6-0232/2005) to the Council and the Commission by Bart Staes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on cooperation within the budgetary authority on the allocation and possible use of the monetary payments resulting from the agreement Commission – Member States/Philip Morris to combat fraud."
". Mr President, Mr Schmit, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to explain the background to these two questions by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The European Union and Member States lose many hundreds, if not billions, of euros every year due to the loss of excise, VAT and customs revenue from the illicit black market trade in tobacco products."
"Every container of smuggled cigarettes is costing the European and national authorities lost income to the tune of EUR 1.5 million."
"During 1995 and 1996, the European Parliament took the lead in the fight against this type of fraud and set up an enquiry committee, which, with John Tomlinson as chairman and Edward Kellett-Bowman as rapporteur, catalogued the problems that occurred during transit and proposed solutions to them."
"The enquiry committee went to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam where it carefully studied the fraud techniques which criminal organisations, often of a Mafia-like nature, used to evade normal tax obligations."
"Let me reiterate that these practices are characteristic of the Mafia, and, over the past few years, they have claimed people’s lives; murders have been committed, officials intimidated and bribed, and in some cases, politicians were working hand in glove with the criminals."
"The excellent work by the enquiry committee, the research work of our anti-fraud services Uclaf and Olaf, the Cigarette Fraud Task Force and the careful cooperation between customs and police services are now resulting in major networks being rounded up."
"In November 2000, the Community lodged a civil complaint before the Court of New York against Philip Morris and Reynolds on account of suspected involvement in the smuggling of cigarettes into the European Union."
"Ten Member States joined this lawsuit between January and April 2001."
"The bare facts that were brought during the debates before the court against Philip Morris forced the tobacco giant to sign a settlement with the European Commission."
"This multi-annual agreement was signed on 9 July 2004 and aims to fight the smuggling and counterfeiting of cigarettes in an effective manner."
"At the same time, it puts an end to the legal dispute between the European Union and Philip Morris."
"The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris will be paying considerable amounts – as high as USD 1.5 billion – into a bank account managed by the European Commission over a 12-year period."
"It represents a departure in terms of anti-fraud policy and ensures that Philip Morris and the European authorities can combine their efforts and work together more closely."
"It is likely that this innovative approach will lead to similar agreements being concluded with the other two main tobacco giants 'British American Tobacco' and 'Japan Tobacco' within the not too distant future."
"The budgetary authority in the European Union has two arms, namely the Council of Ministers and Parliament."
"As Members of Parliament, we are extremely anxious about the way in which the Commission and Member States will handle this unexpected, but considerable windfall."
"According to high-level officials within the Council, the lion’s share of Philip Morris’s funds will end up in the coffers of national Member States."
"Apparently, 10% will go to the Commission, while the ten Member States that joined the lawsuit will receive 90%."
"Can the Council and the Commission confirm this distribution?"
"In this context, it does indeed look like the Member States are behaving like grasping opportunists and mediocre accountants."
"To me, the 10%-90% split seems to underestimate the efforts on the part of the Commission and Olaf, for what will happen with those funds?"
"In actual fact they should mainly be used to combat fraud."
"I am very aware that the so-called earmarking of certain funds for specific activities is considered undesirable by the budgetary authority, but it strikes me as only fair that the Council and the Commission make the political commitment to this Parliament to using a considerable proportion of this sum to fight fraud and counterfeiting."
"Is the Commission prepared to suggest an action plan and a proposal for a budget line to tackle this issue?"
"So much can be done, including more cross-border cooperation, more computers at borders, more and well-trained inspection staff, reinforcement of customs services, investments in tracing and tracking, more effective follow-up policy and extra manpower for Olaf."
"Let us therefore focus on spending funds and not solely on splitting them up."
"This is not just about whose money it is; we should also look for value for money. I am also expecting a progress report from the Commission, possibly behind closed doors, about the negotiations with British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco."
"Finally, only on this basis and on the basis of the agreements we conclude can we continue the debate."
"From the Council, we expect ideas that transcend the bookkeepers’ mentality and proposals on spending this money wisely."
"What is the response to this from the Council and the Commission?"
"Firstly, I should like to point out that the Council attaches great importance to the protection of the European Union's financial interests."
"I can also confirm to the honourable Member the Council’s full agreement with the need to step up the fight against all types of contraband which have developed in recent years."
"In that context we should also welcome the agreement between the Commission, ten Member States and the Philip Morris company."
"However, with regard to the allocation and use of the amount you refer to, and which appears fair to me, I should point out that this is an agreement entered into by the Commission and ten Member States, which means that the Council, as an institution, is not a party to the matter."
"However, I can tell you that discussions between the Commission and these ten Member States on the allocation of the funds have already begun."
"I can assure you that, in the excellent spirit of cooperation between our institutions, the Council will ensure you are kept fully informed of developments on this matter, on the basis of information supplied to us."
"You raise the question of allocating part of that amount for the benefit of the Community budget."
"If part of the funds reverted to the Community budget, the amount involved would have to be entered as revenue, in accordance with applicable budget procedure."
"If these funds were used for actions to combat fraud, as you are proposing, it would be up to the Commission, if it felt it appropriate, to submit proposals on which the European Parliament and the Council – the two branches of the budgetary authority – would have to give a view once that proposal was submitted."
"The Council has noted, as you emphasised, that the agreement includes the possibility for Member States to use these funds to finance actions to combat fraud."
"The Council would like to point out that – since we are dealing with the combat against national fraud using funds which would revert to the national budgets – these funds are the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for its support and efforts, which culminated in the conclusion of an anti-fraud agreement with Phillip Morris International on 9 July 2004."
"This includes the payment of USD 1.25 billion to the European Community and participating Member States over 12 years."
"The agreement underlines the importance of anti-fraud policies and is regarded as a major success for the Commission and OLAF."
"Since the agreement was signed, the Commission has pointed out that all the other Member States should also join it."
"Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland have recently signed and we hope that the other Member States will soon."
"We also sincerely hope that the Phillip Morris agreement can serve as a model for a similar agreement with other companies."
"The Commission, on behalf of the European Community, and the ten Member States that concluded the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeit Agreement with Philip Morris International, will decide how the funds are to be shared out."
"Discussions are ongoing and the Commission has repeatedly stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the distribution of the amounts to be allocated."
"In this regard, we are grateful for Parliament’s support in seeking an adequate share for the Commission allocation."
"The agreement is intended to contribute to the fight against smuggling and fraud."
"It specifies that the monetary payments may serve as a source of additional funding for anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit initiatives."
"However, it does not include specific obligations for their use."
"In the Bösch report on the fight against fraud, adopted only yesterday, Parliament asks the Commission and the Member States to use the payments accruing from the agreement to fund measures to prevent and combat cigarette smuggling, including anti-counterfeiting activities."
"Funds received by the European Community under the agreement will be entered in the Community budget as non-earmarked funds, in accordance with the rules of the Financial Regulation applicable."
"The Community legislator and the budgetary authority can, however, decide to adopt a new programme or to widen the scope of an existing programme."
"The Commission considers that the Community is entitled to receive a fair share of the funds, reflecting the principles of the Community’s own resources system."
"The Commission has been discussing the distribution of the funds with the ten Member States and is confident that a consensus will be reached soon."
"In December 2004 Commissioner Kallas sent a letter to the ministers of finance and has convened two meetings on the subject."
"A final agreement has not yet been reached."
"The question of the share that should be allocated to the Community budget is dependent on the solution that is found to the division of funds between the Member States."
"The Commission actively continues to seek a final consensus."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, smuggling and evading the payment of duties are problems which affect all the EU Member States."
"For understandable reasons, the problem of the illegal circulation of excisable goods is particularly topical."
"According to calculations by the Member States, in 2003 the EU budget suffered a loss of approximately 200 million euro solely as a result of the illegal trade in cigarettes."
"Losses to the Member States’ budgets are much greater."
"Of course, both the Member States’ taxation authorities and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have done a lot to combat the illegal trade in cigarettes."
"In this connection, the initiative to combine forces in the fight against the illegal trade in cigarettes at European Union level, bringing in the legal cigarette manufacturers, is to be welcomed."
"The cooperation agreement concluded by the European Commission and various EU Member States with Philip Morris International is the first example of this cooperation."
"The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris International will improve its cigarette distribution system and will provide more detailed information to the Member States’ law enforcement and tax authorities, which is necessary for effectively combating the illegal trade in cigarettes."
"In addition to this, over a 12-year period Philip Morris International will pay 1.25 billion US dollars into the EU and Member States’ budgets."
"The European Parliament considers that, ideally, all these resources, or at least the major part of them, should be channelled into combating and preventing the trade in illegal tobacco products."
"The European Parliament, as one of the branches of the EU budgetary authority, considers that Parliament should participate in the decision-making on the distribution and use of these resources."
"We consider that those Member States which have not yet subscribed to this agreement, especially the new Member States, ought to seriously weigh up the possibility of joining."
"More precise information and extra financial resources will make it possible to combat more effectively the illegal trade in cigarettes and to improve collection of excise duties."
"Similar agreements could also be concluded with other tobacco companies, and it is to be hoped that this precedent might also encourage the signing of similar agreements with manufacturers of other excisable goods, such as alcohol."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, our man on the Committee on Budgetary Control, for this initiative."
"The Commissioner has already made reference to the fact that we have devoted our attention, in a report that this House adopted yesterday, to the subject of cigarette smuggling, which is one of the really big problems that the European Union currently has to contend with."
"One reason for this is that, when the finance ministers find that the money has run out, the first brilliant idea they come up with is that of increasing the duty on tobacco."
"This means that illegal cigarettes start coming into the country, and so they still end up with less money than they had before."
"What is happening is that the Member States – some of them, I have to say, in full knowledge of what they are doing – are rolling out a red carpet to welcome organised crime."
"Reference has already been made to the agreement initiated by the Commission and OLAF."
"Tremendous though this is, it does – as the rapporteur noted – have an Achilles heel, in that we did not specify in the agreement what is to be done with the money."
"In the event of any such agreements being concluded in the future, it is vital – and Parliament demands – that a formula be specified for how the money is to be shared out."
"Moreover, Mr President-in-Office, I too would be very much in favour of the Council discussing what is to be done with this money; it cannot simply be left to each Member State."
"There is too great a shortage of customs staff."
"Too many of our customs offices are not yet computerised."
"Your institution, too, is obliged to give serious thought to this."
"We expect the money to be allocated to specific purposes when it is paid out."
"I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Staes, for this initiative."
"Like my fellow Member, Mr Dombrovskis, I too have asked for an opportunity to speak briefly on behalf of the new Member States affected by this issue."
"As everybody knows, Hungary is situated in the centre of Europe or, as we say, at the heart of Europe."
"This means that it lies at the crossroads between north and south, east and west, a crossroads used not only for legitimately traded goods, but also for contraband, including cigarettes, drugs and alcohol."
"Halting and curbing traffic in smuggled goods was an important task for our country even before accession; since accession, however, we have become rather like a bastion defending Europe."
"For this reason, we were very pleased to hear about this exemplary and significant agreement that has been signed with Philip Morris International, thanks to the decisive action on the part of the European Commission and OLAF."
"We think it is very important that it can be extended to the new Member States too, although the Commission has signed the agreement on behalf of only ten Member States."
"This means that the advantages it brings in the fight against smuggling and fraud – namely professional, technical and financial support from the EU and OLAF – are now also accessible to us."
"We were also pleased that, in recognition of our special situation, OLAF has taken up contact with the Hungarian authorities and is developing this mutually beneficial cooperation, that protects both European and Hungarian financial interests simultaneously."
". Mr President, this is a complex and important question."
"We have been engaged in negotiations with the Member States in an attempt to reach an agreement."
"Once again I would like to thank the House for its support of our position."
"You have specifically requested that the funds allocated under the agreement should be focused on anti-fraud programmes."
"You are well aware, as I said in my previous remarks, that these are extra-budgetary funds."
"The focus of our efforts at this point remains the conclusion of an agreement on how the funds are allocated, not only between the Commission and the Member States, but also among the Member States themselves."
"The negotiations have been and continue to be difficult, but I am confident that we can resolve the issue in the short term."
"As to the programmes to which the funds are to be allocated, the Commission has taken note of the relevant proposal, which will doubtless be considered in due course, once we have reached an agreement on the distribution of the funds."
"That agreement should then serve to provide the allocation scale for any future similar agreements."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0246/2005)."
"We shall be taking the following questions to the Council:"
"Annex I to the Luxembourg Presidency's conclusions of 22-23 March 2005 sets out the European Youth Pact which proposes three lines of action."
"What practical measures will be taken and what method will be used by the European Union and the Member States to achieve the objectives of the Youth Pact, taking into account the need for solidarity between the generations?"
"Is there a specific deadline within which internationally recognised best practices are to be incorporated into national action plans and specific programmes?"
"Under what circumstances will the results of implementing the Youth Pact be considered successful?"
"The Council confirms that the European Council of 22 and 23 March adopted a European Youth Pact."
"It is also about to adopt the employment guidelines, which, in their general introduction, contain a reference to the European Youth Pact."
"Additionally, guideline 18, which concerns the working life cycle, contains a reference to that Pact, in the context of youth employment and unemployment."
"This guideline will therefore be the object of the follow-up prescribed for all guidelines, based on national reports."
"It should also be noted that a certain number of quantified goals of significance for the European Youth Pact had already been adopted in 2003 as part of the employment strategy."
"These include, between now and 2010, limiting to six months the deadline for offering employment to young unemployed persons, reducing the school dropout rate to 10% and increasing the number of 22-year-olds having completed secondary education to 85%."
"Additionally, the Council has noted the Commission’s intention to submit, in the near future, a communication specifically concerning the pact and entitled: ‘Responding to the concerns of young Europeans – Implementation of the European Youth Pact and the promotion of active citizenship’."
"I believe that the European Union should do more for youth, because the results of the referenda show that young people are the first to lose their enthusiasm for Europe with a majority voting against the Constitution."
"It is on the basis of that communication that the Council’s bodies can begin work on actually implementing the Pact."
"Therefore, the Council is not yet able to provide the honourable Member with details of the timetable or an assessment of progress with regard to the European Youth Pact."
"– Madam President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply, which was comprehensive, and for his particular interest in young people, who should be a concern to us all."
"Τhe problem is whether the three parts of the Pact will be represented accordingly in the next youth programme, especially the part on reconciling family life and work; in other words, the possibility for young people to start new families."
"I think that one of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, in the social and employment spheres, is to reconcile the family, on the one hand, with professional life on the other."
"We know that, frequently, in many countries – but not in all – this combination of family and professional life is difficult, due in particular to a lack of crèches."
"This is an aspect which has already been included in the different employment strategies, but which should also re-emerge in the application of the Youth Pact."
"Judgment in the case concerning the Turkish teachers' organisation, Egitim Sen, will be passed by the Turkish Supreme Court by the end of May."
"The organisation is charged with contravening the Turkish Constitution and jeopardising the unity of the Republic through its support for the principle that all children should have the right to tuition in their mother tongue."
"What measures will the Council take in the event that the Turkish Supreme Court rules against Egitim Sen, and what consequences will such a ruling have for the country's aspirations to become a member of the EU?"
"The honourable Member is aware that the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, while accepting that Turkey adequately met the Copenhagen political criteria so that negotiations for its accession could be opened, clearly indicated at the same time that the Commission would have to continue checking to ensure that the political reform process had been fully and effectively implemented."
"The Commission is required to reflect on all subjects of concern featuring in its regular report and in its recommendation, including, of course, freedom of expression and respect for minorities, and to report back to the Council regularly."
"During the EU-Turkey Association Council of 26 April this year, the Presidency underlined, on behalf of the Union, the absolute necessity for Turkey to complete the suspended reforms without delay, and to ensure full and effective implementation of those reforms, which clearly imply respect for all rights, particularly freedom of expression."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I must, however, ask whether the Turkish Supreme Court’s judgment of 25 May is not cause for alarm, since it takes away children’s self-evident right to be educated in their own mother tongue and to develop against their own cultural background."
"The judgment by the Supreme Court is a crime against human and democratic rights."
"As well as infringing these rights, it also breaks up the teachers’ organisation, which thus loses the right to represent its 200 000 members."
"It is a crime against the ILO Convention."
"The Council should inform Turkey that the door that has been opened will be closed again if human rights are not respected."
"I believe that respect for the rights of minorities, including the right to speak one’s own language, must be one of the benchmarks used for measuring respect for democratic principles, with which all current Member States – and also, of course, those applying or wishing to become members in the future – must comply."
"I am not sure whether your term ‘criminals’ is appropriate, but, in any event, the rights of minorities are an essential part of our approach to Turkey as well."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union's motto is ‘unity in diversity’, and you are well aware that, without respect for that linguistic and cultural diversity, this Europe could not be constructed."
"You have responded positively by saying that the Council is concerned and that it is monitoring the issue of Turkey and the right of children to be educated in their mother tongue, but I would like to ask you whether you are going to do more than simply monitor this issue."
"I believe that the Council of Ministers should do something with regard to Turkey at this point — draw its attention to the issue in some way — so that in relation to this issue we are not simply awaiting the next report from the Commission on compliance or otherwise with the Community acquis."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you intend to do in this regard?"
"I would just like to say that the Turkish Public Prosecutor has already lost twice in this particular case, and that the judgment expected shortly, which will undoubtedly go the same way, will be final."
"It is clear that, in the forums where the European Union holds discussions with Turkey, all these specific cases and other – let us say more general – cases will be discussed, and I believe we must continue to engage Turkey in this dialogue on issues of freedom of expression, the use of language and trades union freedom."
"Madam President, when this judgment was given, I put a question to the Commission about the matter, for it concerns citizens’ and human rights, and we have all been horrified at what has happened."
"My question to the Council is about whether matters are to be coordinated, given that this is an issue concerning both the Council and the Commission, as well as the European Parliament."
"What has happened is very serious."
"I wish to know whether you are coordinating matters or whether we should resume the discussion once I receive my answer from the Commission."
"I believe that there is coordination, but it may be useful to ask the Commission as well."
"As the following questions deal with the same subject matter, they will be taken together:"
"On 14 April 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on the Commission to put forward, before the end of May 2005, a proposal on the establishment of an information system linking those responsible for immigration and asylum policy in the Member States so that they would be notified of important decisions to be taken by one or more Member States."
"Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has once again changed the criteria governing the extraordinary regularisation programme currently under way in Spain. It is now possible for immigrants to have their residence in the country authorised even if they were not registered with their local municipal authorities."
"When and how was the Council informed of the new criteria?"
"The Spanish Government’s regularisation programme for immigrants ended on 7 May. The programme was a great success, with around 700 000 applications being made."
"The aim of the programme was to end illegal employment by integrating illegal immigrants into Spanish society."
"To achieve this, employment contracts were required for regularisation."
"The programme was backed across the board by trade unions, management and civil society."
"In addition to ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants, the programme has put Spain in the perfect position to participate in and promote the establishment of a common European policy on immigration."
"Does the Council support the successful Spanish regularisation programme as a way of ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants into society by granting them full rights?"
"Is the Council of the opinion that, as a result of this scheme, the Spanish Government is in a better position to contribute to the establishment of a common European immigration policy?"
"The honourable Members are asked to refer to the answer already given by the Council to an oral question on the same subject."
"The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it is the responsibility of each Member State to determine the volumes of migrant workers to be admitted."
"With regard to the regularisation programme implemented by the Spanish Government and referred to in the question, this was discussed informally by the Council at its meeting in January 2005."
"The Council would like to remind the honourable Member of the conclusions regarding a mutual information system that it adopted at its meeting on 14 April 2005."
"These conclusions call on the Commission to put forward an initiative before the end of May of this year – which it did not do – to create a mutual information system between the authorities of the Member States responsible for immigration and asylum policies."
"The Council considered that such a system would help to increase mutual trust and lead to a better coordinated approach to immigration and asylum policies in the Member States."
"I therefore invite you to put the question to the Commission as to why it has not put forward the proposal that it was asked for in January."
". Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your comments."
"I am not going to make a statement, but rather I am going to put a clear and direct question: do you believe that the decisions taken in Spain with regard to illegal immigration make a negative or a positive contribution to the future creation of a common European immigration policy?"
"I will first of all point out that Spain took a decision that it had every right to take."
"We are all aware, however, that we want to move towards a better coordinated policy, if not a common policy in this area, which is not yet in place."
"It is also true that it is better for a Member State to coordinate such decisions with its partners."
"At the same time, I understand that this decision was taken in a specific context and that the objective was precisely to integrate people already in Spain as much as possible and in the best way possible."
"Moreover, by integrating them into Spanish society, they are probably prevented from going to other Member States."
"In this sense, I do not think that this decision was taken at the expense of other Member States."
"It is also clear that we all need to realise that better coordination of immigration at European level is the only solution."
". Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe we have debated these issues of a Spanish nature fully — as you have said quite rightly — and furthermore they have been very successful."
"I would therefore like to thank you for your patience and for the continuity of your policy and I would like to offer you our cooperation as Spaniards."
"Patience seems to be a virtue."
"Parliament has taught me something about this."
"What measures has the Council Presidency taken with a view to ensuring that, following the unnecessary delays, progress is finally made in the accession negotiations with Croatia?"
"On 7 March 2005, the Council reaffirmed the Union’s commitment to the accession of Croatia and adopted the framework for negotiations with that country."
"The Council also highlighted the importance of full and complete cooperation from all the western Balkan countries with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"This is an essential requirement for them to continue to build closer links with the European Union."
"For this reason, after discussion in the Council and in the absence of a mutual agreement, the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia had to be deferred."
"In the meantime, a working party consisting of the Presidency, the Secretary General/High Representative, the Commission and the next two Presidencies was created."
"Its task is to examine, in close contact with the Tribunal and Croatia, the steps that Croatia has taken and still needs to take in order to achieve full and complete cooperation with the Tribunal."
"Under these circumstances, the working party met on 26 April 2005 with the Tribunal and the Croatian party in order to examine recent developments in cooperation between Croatia and the Tribunal."
"The group decided that the Council’s conclusions of December and March were still valid and that the Council would review the matter at the appropriate time on the basis of significant future developments in close cooperation with the Tribunal."
"Madam President, I would like to start by asking whether the Luxembourg Presidency is going to put Croatia on the agenda for next week’s summit."
"I would then like to ask what the thinking is behind it being possible – as I have now heard – for the negotiations with Croatia scheduled for 17 March to be put off the day before, while we are told that the principle of applies to the commencement of negotiations with Turkey on 3 October."
"Why is unanimity required in order to begin negotiations with Croatia but in order to refrain from beginning them with Turkey?"
"There is no logic to this whatsoever!"
"I will start by pointing out that Croatia’s cooperation with the Council, and in particular with the working party established within it, has been exemplary; it has also been recognised by the Tribunal, and in particular by its prosecutor."
"I think that the decision is still on hold, and I hope that it will be taken and that it will be a positive one."
"It will be taken unanimously, as all decisions to open negotiations must be taken."
"The European Council may also discuss this particular case, but I do not think that there is any point in discussing it unless we can hope to resolve this issue quickly."
"In its recommendation of 5 June 2001 on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents, the Council called on the Member States to take steps to ensure that the production and advertising of alcoholic drinks for children and young people stopped."
"Four years after this decision, the measures taken have quite obviously not been effective: the industry continues to sell ‘alcopop’ drinks which are clearly targeted at children and adolescents, and consumption of such drinks continues to rise, with all the harmful effects that this implies in terms of public health."
"What have the results of the recommendation been and what measures have been taken in individual Member States?"
"What action does the Council intend to take to counteract the spread of alcoholism among young people?"
"What fiscal measures are envisaged as regards setting rates of excise duties on designer drinks, and what regulatory measures are envisaged to ensure that labelling indicates clearly that the synthetic alcohol and sugar content of these drinks is harmful to health?"
"The Council would like to thank the honourable Member, Mrs Hennicot, for her close monitoring of this matter, which concerns all of us, especially those of us who have children."
"The Council attaches great importance to protecting young people from alcohol, as they are so vulnerable."
"As the honourable Member pointed out, on 5 June 2001 the Council adopted a recommendation asking the Member States to curb the production of alcoholic drinks aimed at children and adolescents, and advertising targeted at young people for this type of drink."
"Also on 5 June 2001, conclusions on a strategy to reduce the damage associated with alcohol were adopted by the Council."
"In the conclusions, it invited the Commission to put forward proposals for a comprehensive Community strategy in this area which would complement national policies and fix a schedule for various measures."
"Following this recommendation, the Council did not remain inactive. However, as it proved difficult to clearly define alcopop-type products and to direct the measures able to be taken at their targets, it preferred to follow a more general policy in accordance with the aforementioned conclusions of 2001."
"It was therefore confirmed that alcohol had an important place in the European Community’s health strategy and in the Community public health programme for 2003-2008, adopted by codecision with Parliament in September 2002."
"This programme enabled projects to be put in place that are jointly funded by the Commission and the Member States and are designed to implement the 2001 recommendation and to prepare a Community prevention strategy on alcohol consumption."
"A working party made up of experts from the Member States was also created for this purpose."
"In June 2004, the Council adopted its conclusions entitled ‘Alcohol and young people’, in which it repeated the invitation issued to the Commission to report to it in 2005 on the implementation, by the Member States, of the measures proposed."
"The conclusions also supported the work done by the Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy on alcohol consumption, stressing that, as part of that strategy, particular attention should be focused on the problem of alcohol consumption among young people."
"Finally, at the Council meeting on 6 December 2004, this invitation to the Commission was repeated once again."
"Between now and the end of 2005, the Commission will in principle be in a position to present, along with the evaluation report requested in the 2001 recommendation, a communication on a comprehensive strategy on alcohol consumption."
"When this document is received, the Council will start work as quickly as possible."
"It is understood that these initiatives in themselves will not be able to deal specifically with the problem of alcopops."
"However, in the long term, they will enable us to establish a Community framework to better inform all citizens, especially young people, about the dangers of alcohol abuse."
"I would like to thank the Council for tackling the issue of alcoholism among young people."
"I think that the health problems due to alcohol and to the high sugar content of the drinks concerned are particularly serious: I am thinking of the increase in diabetes among young people and the problem of obesity."
"I do not understand why the Council does not do more to tackle the problem of labelling, because many parents do not know that their children are drinking alcohol when they drink what they take to be lemonade."
"The Commission, which has on several occasions been invited by the Council to make proposals in this respect, should take into account what the honourable Member has just said."
"It should also take into account the level."
"This is a question of consumer protection, as people do need to know what they are consuming."
"President-in-Office, I should like to point out, in relation to health, that one of the big issues with alcohol consumption is its link to youth suicide."
"That is a particular problem in Ireland."
"It should be given much more emphasis in our strategy."
"Secondly, in relation to advertising, we are concerned about toys being advertised to children during children's programmes, but we also advertise alcohol to them and are introducing them to alcohol at a very young age and making it acceptable."
"We need to look at this."
"Perhaps you could give me your view as to whether that should be included in your future strategy on alcohol and the problems related to it."
"This clearly demonstrates that the Member States need to be able to act quickly and that they have the right to do so."
"In this area, subsidiarity can be applied and some of the principles of the free market cannot be invoked."
"It is not simply a matter of free movement of goods, but above all of health protection."
"I therefore think that it is through examples such as this that Europe should show that it is not rigidly set in a framework that does not recognise real concerns."
"Thank you for asking me this question, but it should be put to the Commission instead."
"Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to put a supplementary question."
"I have one for the Council, and it is this. Are there any alcoholic drinks that are – as Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges has said – demonstrably targeted at children and young people?"
"Secondly, is the Council aware that there are mature adults who like the taste of these drinks and who are penalised by the special duty that is already imposed on them in Germany, to give one example?"
"Thirdly, does the Council agree with me that, rather than seeking centralised solutions through tax systems that treat people as less than adult, it would be better for us to educate children, young people, adults and senior citizens about the dangers of alcohol in general?"
"I do not think that what you said is in contradiction with what I just explained."
"It is clear that these drinks are not solely aimed at children or adolescents."
"In principle, if we give the producers the benefit of the doubt, I do not think that these products are aimed at adolescents."
"However, they do have a particular attraction for this group of the population."
"You mentioned taxation."
"This is true, but what is needed above all is an information campaign among young people, because taxation alone is not a solution."
"It is, first of all, up to the Member States to take all the steps, and the Member States need to be placed in a position, and to be given some degree of freedom, to take these decisions without encountering problems at the end of the line, because, theoretically, they have interfered with the free market and the free movement of goods."
"I therefore think that this is the point on which the European Union should also adopt a position regarding these products."
"It is reported that not all 25 Member States have ratified the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 (14242/01) which would allow joint investigation Teams to be set up."
"How many Member State parliaments have not yet ratified, and when does the Council expect the process to be completed so that the Union may begin to combat Organised Crime in a more serious and more effective manner?"
"So far, 21 Member States have notified the Secretariat General of the Council that they have transposed the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams."
"These Member States can therefore create joint investigation teams in accordance with the framework decision."
"Two Member States have also informed the Secretariat General of the Council that their draft legislation transposing this framework decision has already been submitted to their parliaments, or will be soon."
"One Member State has informed the Council that it has partially transposed the framework decision."
"I am not very good at mathematics, but I make that 24, so one of the Member States you told me nothing about at all."
"What are you doing about the one Member State that apparently is doing nothing about it?"
"I need to check whether in fact there are only twenty-four."
"I need to check whether there is indeed one Member State that has not responded."
"I cannot give you the information now, but I promise you that I will check. I am sure that the information can be supplied in writing."
"Question No 8 has been withdrawn."
"Madam President, on a point of order on which I would appreciate your advice, I was told a moment ago by sessional services that this question has been withdrawn, but I understand that normally every MEP has access to the full list of questions."
"Every MEP has the right to ask a supplementary question, and yet there seems to be no obligation on the person withdrawing the question to tell all the other Members that he has done so."
"So those of us who have come to ask a supplementary question are being denied our democratic right."
"If that really is the case, would you not agree that the rules need to be reviewed?"
"Alternatively, can I ask a supplementary question to Mr Newton Dunn’s question?"
"Clearly it is a crime that I cannot ask a supplementary question, and it has clearly been organised by the Socialists!"
"There are no crimes organised in this House, Mr Bushill-Matthews; we treat each other democratically, amicably and peacefully."
"As regards the question that has been withdrawn, the rules are perfectly clear: if a question is withdrawn by the person who tabled it, it no longer exists, and so you are no longer in a position to put a supplementary question."
"Whether Members should inform each other – even Members of other Groups – when this happens is an interesting question."
"I would simply advise you to start by discussing this with Mr Martin."
"If you have a question you would like to put now supplementary to Mr Newton Dunn’s, then I will allow it on the grounds that two supplementary questions are allowed to each question."
"So please go ahead and ask the President-in-Office of the Council something else about organised crime."
"That is very gracious of you, Madam President, but that would be cheating because my question is about working time and I would not wish to cheat."
"That is very fair."
"We shall continue to discuss what is to be done when Members withdraw questions."
"According to the recent report launched by Save the Children entitled 'We don't do childhood poverty we do large roads!"
"The EU, the Millennium Development Goals and Children', one out of two people living in poverty today is a child. In five years' time, 25 million children in Africa alone will be orphaned as a result of HIV and AIDS."
"One of the main arguments in the report is that children are not being sufficiently addressed in policy."
"Mainstreaming of children´s needs has failed to deliver."
"Does the Council accept the need to place greater emphasis on children in the decision-making process, is there a political will to re-shape policy-making in order to achieve this?"
"The Council is aware of the tragic situation of millions of children living in the majority of developing countries in general, and in Africa in particular, especially due to their vulnerability to famine, violence, infectious diseases and above all, of course, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"The Council would like to point out that the eight Millennium Development Goals target children either directly or indirectly."
"The Council does not believe that it will be possible to achieve these goals by 2015 without a coherent policy for children in the developing countries."
"The Council has highlighted the need to focus specifically on children in implementing the European Union’s development policy, through a series of recent initiatives."
"On 16 December 2004, the European Council confirmed the European Union’s firm commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"During this session, the Council indicated its firm support for the European action plan to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, through external action."
"The Commission presented them at the end of April 2005."
"Joint action between the European Union and the Member States, in cooperation with the main international organisations in the sector, including UNICEF, and with teachers and parents associations in the partner countries is planned."
"The review process of the joint declaration of November 2000 on the European Union’s development policy is underway."
"A communication from the Commission on the future development policy is expected at the end of June."
"During the extended consultation process, several subjects were identified as possible priority themes, which definitely included child protection."
"It should also be pointed out that at Community level, in 2004 Parliament and the Council adopted Decision 803/2004 adopting the Daphne II programme to prevent and eradicate violence, particularly against children."
"In conclusion, children are a fundamental dimension of European Union development policy and the Council intends to highlight this priority, both in the context of preparing for the summit on the attainment of the Millennium Goals, which will take place in September 2005 in New York, and in the process of formulating the Union’s future development policy."
"Mr President-in-Office, I thank your for that very detailed response."
"I should like to ask you to take on board the views of those who know more about children in the developing world than perhaps you or I do, and who are concerned about the fact that we are perceived as a Union that concentrates more on large infrastructural projects than on children, and perhaps to think more deeply about the needs of children in terms of medical care and other assistance."
"I accept what you have said, but I would ask you to analyse more deeply the views of those who know."
"I agree with your analysis: we need to listen to the NGOs."
"When formulating development policy for the next few years, which for the Union consists of transposing the Millennium Goals, these aspects must be specifically taken into account."
"In any case, I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency, which is still in charge of this issue until the end of this month, will take care to ensure that this objective of the protection of children is one of the major objectives of our development strategy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return in particular to one of the topics mentioned: the issue of AIDS and HIV."
"On 2 December 2004, this House voted in favour of a very precise resolution and called for the involvement of the Commission and the Council, with the particular aim of amending the existing TRIPS rules, which are one of the fundamental factors preventing adults and children living in the southern countries of the world from having access to medicines."
"As far as I am aware, nothing has been done in this specific area, that is, amending the TRIPS rules, and I should like to ask the reason for this, partly because the situation has lately become even more tragic with the TRIPS rules being adopted by the Indian Government."
"I think that, as I have already said, the Council has strongly supported the European action programme to combat AIDS and other diseases."
"The Council has also expressed a desire to work on the matter of essential medication and has supported changes aimed at making some AIDS drugs accessible."
"There is a problem with this at the WTO that has not been resolved."
"We are among the largest donors to the fight against AIDS, as, without this money, we would not be in a position to better combat AIDS in the developing countries."
"Europe has more or less fulfilled its commitments, unlike others."
"Question 9 by my colleague, Mrs McGuinness, is very close to my own, question 11, and again, we are not going to get to another question."
"I find that very frustrating."
"On many occasions we wait here and you do not get to our questions."
"We talk about action plans for the Third World, especially with regard to children, but we never hear of any detailed plans or exact initiatives in this area."
"I know it is very complicated and difficult, but very rarely do we hear any details of what is happening on the ground in these parts of the world and how we are tackling the serious problem of children with HIV and AIDS."
"You raise a very relevant and interesting issue."
"I think that you need to ask the Commission - as it is the Commission that needs to answer this question - what actual specific measures are in place, through the various European Union aid programmes, to combat the problems of AIDS or similar problems."
"I think that you have every right to ask the Commission to provide you with an accurate report on specific measures for this purpose."
"Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position to do so, as it is the Commission that implements these programmes and measures."
"I would like to point out that the plenary decided on Monday that Question Time was to be cut down to half an hour, and we have already spent three-quarters of an hour on it."
"I will not now allow the floor to make any more points of order."
"As the scheduled Question Time is over, Questions 12 to 30 will be answered in writing(1)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (COM(2005)0154 C6-0119/2005 2005/0064(SYN)) (A6-0168/2005)"
"and the report by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (COM(2005)0155 C6-0120/2005 2005/0061(CNS)) (A6-0158/2005)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 April I had the pleasure of presenting to you in committee the modifications of the two Regulations providing the basis for the Stability and Growth Pact, which the College of Commissioners had approved on the 20th of that same month."
"Five weeks later we debated the reports by Mr Karas on the two regulations here in the plenary of the European Parliament, which is another demonstration of the good spirit of cooperation in which this Parliament has dealt with this important issue."
"Over these few weeks, Parliament, the Council and we in the Commission have worked to complete the legislative process of reforming the Pact before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Following this first phase of examining the Commission’s proposals here in Parliament, we will be closer to an agreement, which could be reached –– and I hope it will be reached, if at all possible –– before the end of this month."
"As I explained when I appeared in committee, our proposal, in accordance with the mandate of the European Council –– which, in turn, had supported the report of the Ecofin Council in March –– was restricted to the modifications of the Regulations that were strictly necessary in order to make them compatible with the Council’s agreement."
"Nevertheless, during the Council’s work, several Member States have argued that certain provisions should be included in the articles of the Regulation, such as, for example, the minimum annual fiscal adjustment of 0.5% of gross domestic product for countries in situations of excessive deficit or which need to move closer to a position of medium-term balance, or the explicit indication of other relevant factors."
"These requests have prolonged the discussion on certain points on which there was already agreement in the Council by a few days."
"Fortunately, that agreement has been maintained, and according to my information, the Council’s working group has reached a final agreement on the issue today."
"For its part, Parliament, by means of the report by Mr Karas, has expressed its concern about certain parameters that effect the credibility of multilateral budgetary surveillance, such as, for example, the quality of national fiscal statistics, the surveillance of debt or the reliability of macroeconomic forecasts."
"Parliament also, entirely legitimately, demands that it be regularly informed about excessive deficit procedures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that the Commission has the same concerns as Parliament."
"Many of them have been taken up, or can be taken up, in some of the different components of the raft of legal texts regulating the coordination of economic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union."
"In the Commission’s view, certain other concerns expressed in some of the amendments in the reports by Mr Karas –– I am referring specifically to the surveillance of debt and regular information for Parliament on excessive deficit procedures –– may perfectly well be included in the Pact’s Regulations."
"I said this just this week, on Monday, to the Eurogroup ministers, and I also made certain specific comments about how they could be taken up."
"It naturally falls to the Council to take these suggestions into consideration and it will then formally express its opinion next Monday, I believe."
"In any event, I hope that our cooperation over recent weeks will be maintained until the end of the legislative procedure, in order to provide us, as soon as possible, with a renewed Stability and Growth Pact that is suited to the true economic dynamic of the Member States, from both political and legal points of view."
"The broad consensus relating to this reform is undoubtedly contributing to increasing the credibility of the Pact and demonstrating an unequivocal desire to promote healthier public finances as a condition necessary for sustained economic growth."
"Just yesterday, right here in Strasbourg, the College of Commissioners adopted a report which recommends the initiation of an excessive deficit procedure with regard to a Member State, Italy."
"This is a further example of the effectiveness of the Stability and Growth Pact and a practical example of the spirit stemming from the reform of the Pact."
"It is also an indication that we must hold a discussion on the Pact’s operational rules as soon as possible and focus on the application of those rules and on the practical implementation of the Pact’s principles and guidelines."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to stress that if one thing has been made clear by the recent votes against the draft European Constitution in France and the Netherlands, it is, I believe, the need to act and to achieve concrete results that bring tangible benefits in terms of the well-being of the citizens, beginning with employment and the strengthening of our social model."
"Hence the need to reach a final agreement over the coming weeks on the reform of the Pact, which will provide the foundations for decisive action by the European Union to make our economies more dynamic, to generate employment and to promote the sustainability of our levels of social cohesion."
"The efforts of all the institutions –– Parliament, the Council and the Commission –– are moving in this direction and I am convinced that they will allow the modified regulations to be adopted before the end of this month and hence before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking those present for their excellent cooperation over recent years and during the preparation of the reports which we are debating here today."
"I intend to divide my comments into two parts. I have a few words to say on the Stability and Growth Pact, after which I shall turn my attention to the two regulations."
"I see the approach taken by many of those in public office to the Stability and Growth Pact, which was included in the Treaty and signed in Amsterdam in 1997, as a clear example of the double standards of numerous politicians and the double game they play between domestic policy and Brussels."
"Unfortunately, it sometimes had to be used in the past as an excuse for the purpose of making popular statements at home, rather than being used to safeguard, in a spirit of solidarity, the acceptance of responsibility in the European Union."
"I do not see the Stability and Growth Pact as an onerous duty or laborious task imposed by the European Union; on the contrary, it is a necessary coordination framework for national budgetary policy within the framework of monetary union, in which, while monetary policy is centralised, budgetary policy is a national matter."
"However, one thing is certain: the incentive structures for budgetary policy have changed with monetary union."
"Before, the penalties of the financial markets were clearer and stronger."
"If, for example, Italy pursued a shaky budgetary policy, interest on the financial markets rose instantly in anticipation of devaluation."
"Now governments do not have such a clear idea of what the financial markets make of poor budgetary policy."
"The continually criticised penalties and sanctions at the end of a long process therefore make sense, as the financial markets no longer have their previous powers."
"Another point is that, unfortunately, it is not possible in monetary union to avoid one’s dues and pursue a budgetary policy with no sense of solidarity."
"That is why coordination is needed, in order to relieve the burden on monetary policy as a whole and make sure that interest rates stay low."
"It is for me beyond question that there should be a framework for budgetary policy in the Member States in monetary union, including for the purpose of preventing excessive debt and guaranteeing monetary stability."
"In my view, the Stability Pact has a persistent design fault which, unfortunately, we cannot repair because it is in the Treaty."
"Unfortunately, the sinners can stand in judgment and, as they have done in the past, disregard what the Commission proposes in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties."
"This has led to a loss of trust and credibility and has, at times, been an expression of action with no sense of solidarity."
"Nonetheless, the euro is a success, as is the Stability and Growth Pact, for, without it, we would not have had the debates on the causes of deficit and the objectives of budgetary policy. It is also the basis of today's debate and the basis for the necessary reforms and adjustments being made."
"I think it is a good thing that there is this framework, because it allows us to talk about deficits, the causes of deficits and the effects of deficits more intensively and in all openness."
"The public have more confidence in the euro than in many of the European Union’s other political projects."
"However, the subject of today's debate is not the Stability Pact per se; it is the Commission's two proposals for regulations based on the decision taken by the European Council of 22 and 23 March."
"Both the majority in committee and I as rapporteur have taken note of the Council conclusions; we do not question these decisions, but we do judge these two proposals for regulations on the basis of principles and statements."
"Our aim in our evaluation of the proposals for resolutions, was to bring about greater transparency, define rather than interpret and implement rather than avoid the decisions promised."
"We want greater transparency and better definitions."
"Different procedures apply to these two regulations."
"Regulation No 1466/97 on the preventative aspects is governed by the cooperation procedure, while Regulation No 1467/97 on the excessive deficit procedure is governed by the consultation procedure with the Commission and the Council."
"I should like to comment first on the regulation on the preventative aspects, in respect of which our committee made two central demands."
"Firstly, we want the quality of statistics to be improved; although Greece is not the only example of this, it is one with which we are all familiar."
"We feel that the quality of statistics at national and Community level must be ensured in order to guarantee the independence, integrity and accountability of both national statistical offices and Eurostat."
"Secondly, we want the Commission not only to accept statistics, but also to conduct the dialogue in the Member State with the acting persons and institutions for the purpose of analysing the situation."
"We want stronger cooperation with the European Central Bank, because we cannot have a situation in which two different statistics are audited even though they are not comparable and possible contradictions result in questions from the Commission to the Member State."
"This cooperation, these comparisons, this interpretation and questions of cooperation between the European Central Bank and the Commission during the evaluation and comparison of statistics is important for us."
"Secondly, we want medium-term budgetary objectives to be reviewed at least annually rather than regularly and for the general government debt ratio to be taken into account."
"For Regulation No 1467/97 on the excessive deficit procedure, we want a clear definition of exceptional factors, because the interpretation is too broad here and there is too little transparency."
"We want minimum European standards for budgetary planning to be created."
"The Commission should specify the parameters to the Member States, including for more uniform growth forecasting."
"We want the maximum deadline for regaining targets to be limited to three years from when the deficit occurred."
"We are also of the opinion that we need a specific list of relevant factors to be taken into account in the deficit procedure."
"We accept the proposal as it stands."
"We want to make it more specific, accountable and credible and to reduce the margin for interpretation, so that it is easier to guarantee compliance, and we want to use these two regulations to give the Pact more credibility, win back confidence in it and hence respond to uncertainty among the people about the degree of seriousness with which European decisions are addressed."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, we have often debated the Stability Pact here in the past."
"I thank the rapporteur for his report, which has built on the Council decision and finished the job, although I cannot hide the fact – and I say so directly – that I am not happy with the Council decision."
"The precondition to a Stability and Growth Pact in an area with a single currency is that budgetary policies should converge, that they should not diverge too greatly."
"What is ultimately at stake is nothing other than the viability of our currency."
"We have had enough material for discussion over recent days about the views that many, including many in positions of political responsibility, take of this and, where possible, debates in previous months also made a further contribution."
"We expect the Commission – as the rapporteur said – to set out exactly how the Council decision will be interpreted through the regulations in the future."
"What is meant by a ‘slight excess’ or a ‘temporary’ one?"
"Which ranges will be accepted by the Commission in future?"
"I hope and wait for the Commission to be strict here and we shall soon see how – with one eye on Italy – it approaches the new Pact and if it is worth the paper it is written on."
"I hope for the necessary strictness here."
"I also hope that the Commission will always put its finger on the actual problems."
"Making correlations of this kind between unemployment and the Stability Pact is typical of the cheap policy being pursued in the nation states, and so we should not be surprised if a majority of people believed in the referenda what the nation states convey in Brussels: that the euro is responsible for unemployment and it would be best to get rid of it."
"The Commission has a huge responsibility not to give into these cheap arguments by the nation states and, if it comes down to it, to draw the necessary conclusions, take recourse to the Court of Justice where necessary and fight for the euro, a strong currency and the future, as did its predecessors."
"This regulation and the Council decision do not make your life any easier."
"You will have even more responsibility for it."
"I wish you luck with it."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the political situation in the European Union is too serious to get lost in legal wrangling over the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Twenty-five Heads of State or Government have recognised the necessity of applying the Stability and Growth Pact flexibly to allow adjustments to be made to economic cycles."
"They have adopted the Commission’s proposals without amendment, allowing the renewed pact to come into force quickly."
"This House really should not try to be more Catholic than the Pope. We must stop elevating stability to dogma."
"Stability is necessary."
"No one can live on credit for ever, not even the Americans."
"All the same, they do take a more pragmatic approach to fiscal policy, they have both deficits and growth."
"The euro zone is sinking into stagnation."
"Economic policy is not an exact science."
"A balanced budget is not enough for growth and job creation."
"The nations of Europe are in revolt because the European Union seems to have no other policy to offer than budget austerity."
"The EU needs to be jump started, we need to stimulate demand and encourage investment."
"So-called structural reforms that cut wage earners’ purchasing power will not fill manufacturers’ order books."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was invented to prevent the states of the euro zone from having too much recourse to the capital market."
"Excessive public borrowing would push up interest rates, penalise private investors and be inflationary."
"The opposite has happened, however."
"Despite some states’ repeated breaches of the pact’s rules, the euro has become strong, inflation is still low and interest rates are at rock bottom."
"Moreover, the right seems to think that the Stability and Growth Pact has proved satisfactory despite the failings of a few major countries."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for example, adopted an amendment to my report on the broad economic policy guidelines saying: ‘Whereas the Stability and Growth Pact has contributed to maintaining a low level of inflation and historically low levels of interest rates ...’"
"This statement of faith, which ignores the role of the European Central Bank, apparently means that the breaches of the Stability and Growth Pact are not having the macroeconomic consequences we are hearing about."
"Joking apart, however, the truth is that Europe’s economic situation is much better seen from outside."
"The world’s leading exporter and the biggest market for the rest of the world, the European Union is an economic giant that is still highly competitive."
"We cannot compete with the Chinese in tee-shirts and jeans, it is true, but our consumers have the benefit of this free boost to their purchasing power."
"At the same time, Europe is moving forward in high value-added products."
"Take the motor industry, for example."
"While bonds issued by General Motors and Ford have been downgraded to junk bond level, the most recent statistics show that the European industry ranks first in the world for the number of cars produced: 17.2 million in Europe, 14.6 million of them in the Union of the Fifteen."
"The United States, the home of mass production, made only 4.5 million cars in 2003, and that includes a large number of Japanese cars manufactured there."
"I could quote many more examples."
"My conclusion is clear."
"We must stop being pessimistic about Europe and bolster European confidence again, especially consumer confidence."
"The high savings rates in France, Germany and Italy denote an unjustified fear for the future."
"The conduct of economic policy demands stability, yes, but above all growth and also a psychological campaign to restore confidence."
"We must therefore send our people a much more optimistic message."
". The latest available data prove that public finances in the European Union are a well-kept secret, because we can be aware of some figures only later to find out that the true figures are quite different."
"This is a problem we should address irrespective of whether we are speaking of a small or a big country."
"Therefore, the proposals drawn up by the Commission are truly well-timed and necessary; however, as a representative of the Lithuanian state, which has always showed due diligence in implementing stringent fiscal policy and cost-saving measures at the expense of public services so as to execute all European Union requirements, I can only regret that we have learnt now that we possibly may not have had to implement those requirements."
"I am saying this to make you understand the reaction of new Members."
"I would like to emphasise that we should not expect any of our decisions or audit missions to ensure the transparency of public finances, reliability of data and the stability of finances directly."
"This should be done by the Member States themselves."
"They must achieve the actual implementation of all provisions."
"Therefore, I regret that the Code of Ethics has not been presented as yet and that the provisions of this reviewed version of the Stability and Growth Pact, as proposed, may not be observed."
"Why was it necessary to carry out the revision in view of the probability that we may not actually follow its new provisions?"
"In general, the review of the Stability and Growth Pact is not a bad thing, as the experience in my country has shown that excessively stringent regulations curb growth and produce certain deflationary pressures."
"Moreover, structural reforms are impossible to implement without additional expenditures; however, we should not forget that all this can only be achieved via the coordination of economic policy, which should be future-oriented and secure."
"The European Union countries have no choice but to achieve financial stability and coordinate economic policy and measures, as we have mentioned during our morning discussion of the Constitution."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one point on which I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Karas, it is that the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is still a very long way from giving Europe the capacity for economic governance that would allow it to satisfy all its citizens, both of this generation and those to come."
"We are still a long way from the situation in the United States, a much more integrated federation than our own, where there is a significant federal budget, where there are rules for coordinating the budgets of the federal states, where budgetary policy and monetary policy are closely coordinated by Congress, where Congress is able to influence the options taken by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and where the Federal Reserve’s objectives are wider than mere price stability."
"Having said that, I believe that Commissioner Almunia’s proposals, from the previous term of office to their adoption by the Council in a more improved version, are an extremely positive step, and our Group will oppose the calls – from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in particular – for backtracking to what the former Commission President called a more stupid pact."
"We think we have taken a significant step towards an intelligent pact."
"If we may still make a contribution, simply by way of clarification, we suggest, in one of our amendments, both including education expenditure alongside research expenditure among the relevant factors that might justify an increase in the deficit, and making explicit mention of expenditure for the stability of the world’s ecological balance among the Union’s objectives."
"By this we mean expenditure for the implementation of the Kyoto Agreement."
". – Mr President, we have long been warning of the economic and social consequences of implementing the Stability and Growth Pact and of the risks of attaching absolute priority to nominal convergence, without taking account of the reality of each Member State, their differing levels of development and varying budgetary needs."
"The irrational nature of the criteria – public deficit below 3% of GDP, public debt below 60%, or indeed the subsequent objectives of achieving zero deficit – did not, and still does not, have any economic justification."
"We have always said that following this path would have an adverse effect on economic growth and jobs, and this is being borne out by reality."
"Furthermore, the recession in countries with excessive deficit has been exacerbated by the possibility of fines, the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact and constraints on public investment, and, by extension, on the proper implementation of the Structural Funds."
"This is one of the main factors behind the so-called ‘deterioration’ in the EU accounts, an issue that has come to the fore in recent years, and to which the over-valuation of the euro has certainly contributed."
"Current economic and social reality bears out our stance. This was also the case when ex-President Prodi and other Members of his Commission controversially labelled the Stability and Growth Pact as ‘stupid’ and as having ‘medieval’ criteria."
"This is why we are holding this debate today. Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact would not otherwise have been revised, aside from the many cosmetic changes made at last year’s Spring European Council."
"It is now true that the Council and the Commission have repeatedly said that a degree of sanity needs to be restored to the Stability and Growth Pact, that relevant factors in the analysis of budgetary situations must be taken into account, and that the objective of zero deficit is not the be-all-and-end-all."
"They insist, however, on maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact as a key instrument in achieving their neoliberal aims of undermining the public sector and the social responsibilities of the State, whilst promoting price stability, wage moderation and the privatisation, most worryingly, of social security."
"The Council therefore reaffirms the aims of the Stability Pact and its benchmarks, and prevents any expenditure from being excluded from the deficit calculation."
"What the Council adopted was simply the provision of more time, especially to countries guilty of non-compliance such as Germany and France."
"The room for interpretation on the basis of the Lisbon structural reforms – what is known as the ‘Lisbonisation’ of the Pact – is little more than a means of enabling the more powerful countries to make interpretations that suit their interests, and not intrinsically for us to have an Pact."
"What we need is to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact and to make a clean break from the current economic guidelines – this was the clear message from the French and Dutch no votes on the so-called ‘European Constitution’ – in order to create the macro-economic conditions to revitalise the economy, to stimulate job creation and to work proactively to combat growing unemployment and high poverty and inequality levels in the EU."
". Mr President, I do not know why we are having this debate."
"Mr Karas acknowledges that the Stability Pact relies on Member States disciplining themselves."
"He needs to go a step further in deducing that, for that very reason, the pact cannot work; it never could work."
"So I regret that his well-intentioned attempts to try and make it work by tightening definitions will be in vain."
"Rather than pretending that fiscal discipline can be achieved, we should consider the consequences when it is not achieved."
"Let me focus on Italy, where the deficit has now been shown to have been above the 3% margin for several years; debt is 106% of GDP; inflation is making the economy increasingly uncompetitive and economic growth is negative."
"The real danger here is that these conditions will culminate in a credible threat from Italy to reissue its own national currency, enabling it to devalue and thereby regain competitiveness without painful and prolonged deflation."
"Such an action would have serious Argentina-style results for Italy but could, nevertheless, be seen as the best course of action."
"But a decision by Italy to re-issue the lira would undermine confidence in the ability of the euro to survive as a multinational currency."
"Other EU countries would then be faced with the prospect of providing the Italian Government with large-scale financial assistance to persuade it to stay with the euro."
". Mr President, unfortunately the credibility of the European Union has been increasingly questioned over the past few weeks."
"Rather than trying to construct a new consensus, as Mr Barroso suggested last week, we should concentrate on strengthening the current European consensus on competitive markets, fiscal discipline and hard currency."
"Sound economics, realism and results are what citizens are demanding and what are needed to continue to build the European project."
"Economic reform is needed to create vibrant economies, as has been proven in a number of cases in Europe."
"If we want enlightened social policies, in the European tradition, we need to reform our economies."
"The examples are there for all to see."
"The revised Stability and Growth Pact gives more countries more time to correct excessive deficits and provides more leeway for countries with strong public finances."
"Monetary union requires this level of flexibility, so that more internal market competition can be stimulated."
"The one-size-fits-all situation was always going to be a problem."
"However, some countries need to cut back on their budgets and others – like my own, Ireland – need to spend more on infrastructure, because they have a deficit, but that is not allowed under the rules."
"However, giving an inch in terms of flexibility does not mean countries are allowed to take a mile in terms of widening fiscal deficits."
"Enforcement of the rules is the key."
"There must always be confidence in the fiscal framework that underpins the European Union."
"The recent drop in the euro has been used as a convenient whipping boy for all that has happened recently with the European Constitution."
"The problem is not with the euro."
"The problem in some countries is that they are avoiding the stark reality that the world economy is changing and will continue to change."
"Today’s world economic order demands a lot more, a lot faster and a lot cheaper."
"Going back to the basics of economics, countries either meet this demand or it will be met elsewhere."
"There is no point in lamenting over the basic economic principle; there is no point in arguing that we do not have a means of competing with the global economy."
"We do, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact."
"However, the failure to enforce these rules has left too many countries stagnating in an economic period that no longer exists."
"We cannot continue like this, because it is undermining the credibility of the overall EMU framework."
"Consequently, this has had broader repercussions in sending a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself."
"This has never been more obvious than it is at present."
"Europe is suffering from a credibility problem and to deal with it we urgently need to evolve from rule makers to economic performers."
"Sound economics, realism and results are what the citizens want, and our job is to deliver."
"Questions relating to increased monitoring of the state of budgets, such as the issue of speeding up and clarifying procedures applicable in the case of excessive deficits, are those where parliamentary institutions, as independent and directly-elected institutions at both EU and Member State level, can and should play the role of guardians of the soundness of economic policies, especially as regards their budgetary and deficit-generating consequences."
"In this respect, I consider the European Parliament’s proposed amendments to be positive, and greatly appreciate them."
"The package of Council directives will, however, remain an open document that will, for a long time to come, enable the national governments to use various means to escape this prudent budgetary and deficit framework, to employ more or less obvious forms of putting their countries into debt and to skilfully disguise the expenditure of one-off, unique resources, such as those from privatisation, for governments’ current economic management."
"Naturally, this meets the purposes of short-term government policies."
"The path ahead of us is therefore still a long one, but it is one that we must travel."
"Mr President, the Stability and Growth Pact crops up regularly in debates on the economy in this Chamber."
"This is an illustration of the central position this agreement has in EU economic policy-making."
"In this respect, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Karas, on his two reports on this subject."
"The report’s emphasis on a stronger role for the Commission in enforcing budgetary discipline is an absolutely necessary development."
"Especially now, in their watered-down format, the Commission will have to enforce a clear and strict line with regard to the rules of the pact."
"Furthermore, the absence of the European Parliament in the decision governing the Stability and Growth Pact is rightly highlighted as a serious structural flaw in European economic governance."
"As the only directly democratically elected EU institution, this Parliament could play a vital role in putting an end to the political horseplay that goes on in the Council and provide the pact with the much needed credibility that many colleagues want."
"However, let us not fool ourselves: even with the improved institutional feedback mechanisms that this report suggests, it is not the Stability Pact alone that will lift Europe out of its economic slumber."
"Helpful as they are, it is not a set of rules that will help us to put public finances in Europe on a strong footing."
"What we need is economic growth and advances in competitivity, and these derive not from the rules of the pact but from meaningful economic reform, something which many European Member States have avoided for far too long."
"So we have a new pact and I hope, with Mr Karas’ reports, a better way of making the rules work in a sensible and equal fashion."
"But until countries achieve meaningful economic reform, we will soon find ourselves in yet another debate on the inflated importance of the pact."
"I hope the Commissioner will do his utmost to prevent any further dilution of the commonly agreed commitments of the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, basically, if I look at what happened in France on 29 May objectively, a lot of reasons are mentioned, including enlargement."
"Personally, the difficulty we are having in taking advantage of all the space and all the added value that economic and monetary union should have brought us is a real source of concern to me, and I believe it is the real explanation for what happened in my country."
"Today we are debating reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, and I would like to express my agreement with my fellow Member Mrs Kauppi on one point."
"This reform will not bring us all the answers we need if, finally, we are to find the right solution in the euro zone, which ought to be the engine for growth in the Europe of the Twenty-Five as a whole."
"Let us, however, accept that what you have done, Commissioner, in agreement with the President of the Euro Group, is a step in the right direction."
"I hope, moreover, that you will be wise enough to accept some of the European Parliament’s amendments so that we can bring these negotiations to a conclusion under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"So far as statistical reform, predictability and agreement on the macroeconomic data that should underlie the preparation of the Member States’ budgets are concerned, it seems to me that there are things that should allow us to move in the right direction."
"This stage is, of course, only one among others, however."
"On one point I must disagree with Mrs Kauppi, however."
"It came up repeatedly in our debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: on its own, structural reform will not be enough to restore domestic confidence, stimulate internal demand and achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy."
"What we need is more coordination and, on this subject, I absolutely deplore the lack of thinking since economic and monetary union."
"We need to develop more means, to find other ways besides the Stability Pact, which is still not adequately geared to growth."
"I wish you good luck for this first stage, Commissioner."
"– Mr President, the workers in the countries of the European Union oppose the capitalist restructurings which result in a reduced standard of living and increased unemployment."
"They denounce the commercialisation of health and education and the cutbacks in the remaining public utilities and their privatisation."
"They oppose and are fighting the new, worse, insurance systems."
"They are calling – and rightly so – for the Stability Pact, the tool and alibi for anti-grass roots objectives, to be abolished."
"The reform of the Stability Pact by the European Council on 22 and 23 March was put forward as a relaxing of criteria."
"Under no circumstances, however, is it a relaxing of anti-grass roots policy; it is another burden on grass-roots incomes for the benefit of big business."
"That is why the workers should have no delusions or room for expectations."
"Unfortunately, today's report does not move in the right direction either."
"Not only is it indifferent to the trials of the workers, but it also calls for even more unfavourable terms for the application of multilateral supervision and even for a Community fraud squad to undertake financial auditing missions."
"It calls on the central banks to act as guardian of statistics and sets deadlines for adjusting to the Pact, in which recommendations are made about excessive deficits and debt, as in the case of Greece."
"In Greece, the government has used deficits and financial prudence in order to unleash a series of anti-grass roots austerity measures and programmes, thereby guaranteeing even more poverty for the people."
"It would appear that the referenda in France and the Netherlands have been ignored."
"It is as if they never took place and they can carry on as before."
"However, the referenda returned a resounding ‘no’and were a real expression of insubordination and disobedience to the commands and policy of the European Union and the political forces which support it, and that is promising."
"Mr President, at the European Summit of 22 March, it was decided to review the Stability Pact, and the Council agreed on a new kind of Stability Pact, one to which we hope the Member States will adhere this time around."
"I have always said that stretching the Stability Pact is harmful to economic growth and monetary stability, while at the same time denting public confidence in the euro and therefore in Europe itself."
"The fact that the change to the Stability Pact concerning the 3% limit is not being made public does nothing to improve confidence in the euro."
"Although Member States will be permitted to exceed the 3% limit, the Council and the Commission have not, to date, explained how this new arrangement will be translated into practice."
"If the 3% limit can be exceeded, does that mean that a new limit will be introduced?"
"This is a pressing question, and I would like Commissioner Almunia to answer it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have often discussed the Stability Pact and I am going to try to summarise some of the things that have been said."
"My spokesman, Mr Radwan, has said something that I agree with: we are beating the retreat."
"The Pact I liked was the Pact of 1996, which was signed by the CDU Minister Theo Waigel and defended by your predecessor, Commissioner Solbes."
"We have not been able to maintain it."
"The Council noted that there was generalised non-compliance in Europe, and it could have done two things: it could have demanded compliance or, euphemistically, it could have made the Pact more flexible, and that is exactly what it has done."
"You are appearing here to explain to us the modifications that need to be made to the Regulations in order to make this Pact effective."
"What could Parliament do?"
"What could my group do?"
"We could have produced amendments aimed at reviving the previous Pact, in the form it then took."
"We have not done that because, following Ortega’s advice, we do not like pointless efforts, which only lead to melancholy."
"We have presented some amendments, which Mr Karas has explained very well."
"The intention is to ensure that the disaster does not get any worse."
"Our intention is to ensure that it is applied properly, in technical terms, with reliable statistics, we want to reduce the margin for arbitrariness, filling in the legal gaps, in short, we want to ensure that the retreat is not a complete disaster."
"It has been said here that Europe is not going well and that is the case."
"But if it is not going well, it is not a result of the Stability Pact, but rather of our not having complied with that Pact."
"The Stability Pact, budgetary authority, to put it in quasi-theological terms, is a virtue, a necessary condition, though insufficient, for growth."
"Furthermore, as Mrs Kauppi has pointed out, we need those reforms that we have been unable to carry out."
"Parliament is helping you; it is helping you to reduce the Governments’ margin for discretion."
"It is up to you to ensure that this does not get any worse."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Karas and the House’s shadow rapporteurs for the report we are debating."
"You have cooperated well and succeeded in pulling this important discussion out of a superficial, ideological debate and ensuring that this House is able to help reform the Stability and Growth Pact, something that is urgently needed."
"Why do I say that the reform is urgently needed?"
"Let us simply review the economic facts."
"We have designed a pact which has lived solely by the idea that it has to combat inflation."
"This is an important objective and many Member States have managed to achieve it to a large degree."
"However, at no time was it designed for an Economic and Monetary Union in which we also urgently need to achieve macro-economic coordination, because we need to have the flexibility required in order to be able to react appropriately in an economic cycle, in both large and small national economies."
"Compare the data situation in the USA with the data situation in the European Union."
"Since 2002, the USA has been in a much better position to react to external shocks: to rising oil prices, to September 11, to the crisis on the stock markets."
"Why?"
"Because its central bank was able to be much more flexible than the European Central Bank and, more importantly, because financial policy did what was needed in the short-term economic situation at the time."
"We need flexible and better coordination of our financial policies, so that we can restore trust in the European economy, but, first and foremost, for the sake of our jobs."
"– Mr President, I should first like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks."
"He has managed to formulate a contentious issue in a relatively short space of time in such a way that Parliament can support it with a large majority."
"This was not an ideological debate, Mr Bullmann; it was an acknowledgment that the political will to keep to the 1996 Stability and Growth Pact was missing."
"At the first serious general test, the two large states, France and Germany, failed totally, assisted at the time by Luxembourg and Greece."
"This start prevented the Stability and Growth Pact from playing its proper part as originally planned."
"In this respect, the current reform is, in all events, a second best solution, which uses the argument of flexibility in order to exclude future infringements of the rules."
"In saying this, I am also voicing criticism of my own government in Germany."
"Introducing the costs of European unification as a new criterion has thrown the door wide open to arbitrariness and means, in principle, that sanctions will no longer be possible in future, even with a 4% or 5% excess."
"I consider this to be a definite mistake."
"Given the powerful role of the Council and the inadequate role of Parliament in this matter, the Commission could only react defensively."
"We have debated this often here in this Chamber."
"That is why I think it is a good thing that Mr Karas addresses precisely this point in his reports."
"More competence for the Commission, a stop to the sinners standing in judgment and greater participation by the European Parliament – these are things we can agree on."
"However, nobody will be able to say that this version of the Stability and Growth Pact is forward looking and will contribute towards the future stability of the euro."
"Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to say that I think matters have gone extremely well for Commissioner Almunia when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The result is sensible modernisation, which we can fully support."
"What we now have is the golden European triangle with three types of instrument we shall have operating together."
"The first is the Stability and Growth Pact, the second the Lisbon process and the third the broad economic guidelines."
"Having said that, Mr President, I cannot hide the fact that our debate today is taking place in the light of referenda in France and the Netherlands which, among many other things, reflect a grass-roots demand for a real agenda for Europe."
"Such an agenda also means our having to say that we have understood Europe’s need for the Stability and Growth Pact but that the pact does not, of course, in itself create new jobs."
"It is the basis for getting structural reforms and, at the same time, macroeconomic investment under way."
"Moreover, it is because of these efforts that the national governments need to concur with our line of thinking."
"With the modernisation of the Stability and Growth Pact, we have obtained a useful tool, but that tool must now be accompanied by a number of other tools at national level that can create the new jobs we so badly need."
"That, Commissioner Almunia, is why I hope that this pact, which is now almost in place – and which I am certain will be implemented – is the first step on the way to a new and genuine agenda which, in reality, is the prior condition for creating popular understanding in connection with that modernisation of the treaties that we have been debating so vigorously over the last few days."
"If I may, I should like to make a few remarks, even though I represent the Czech Republic, which is not a member of the eurozone."
"The first thing I would like to say is that the main reason for the victory of the ‘no’ camp in the recent French referendum was French people’s fears regarding the future of their expensive social system."
"France is, of course, a member of the eurozone, and cannot therefore allow itself to violate the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact in the long term: in my opinion, this will lead to rising tension between the existing rules and the willingness of French politicians to please large parts of their domestic electorate."
"Secondly, it is not at all clear in the short term how vigorously and, above all, with what political courage public finance reform will be carried out."
"I am thinking in particular of France, which will only be able to keep its finances under control by restructuring government revenue and expenditure, or in other words by carrying out unpopular reforms."
"The situation in the Netherlands is somewhat different, and this is the third point I should like to make."
"After entering the eurozone, the Dutch had to give up their strong currency, and under the hugely unfavourable conditions of an undervalued exchange rate."
"They doubtless reminisce about the strong guilder, which would now help them solve the problem of negligible economic growth."
"Fourthly, other key members of the eurozone, namely Italy and Germany, are experiencing problems with over-expensive social systems and sclerotic economies, and they can expect structural reforms that will doubtless be tough."
"It is of key importance for the stability of the euro, and I think Mr Karas’ analysis of this point was relatively accurate, that the basic rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remain unchanged, or that they apply to all countries always and at every moment."
"That is why the eurozone countries should first comply with the current rules that apply to everyone, and only then debate any possible relaxing of these rules."
"Mr President, since we are speaking of steering the European economy, I cannot resist making the following observation: by bringing the euro closer to the dollar, the combined efforts of the citizens of France and the Netherlands will have done more, in the space of a few days, to make European exports more competitive than anything the European Central Bank has done."
"I would therefore like to pay tribute to the effectiveness of Europe’s citizens rather than the certainties of the central bankers."
"The March Council’s decision to reform the Stability and Growth Pact – a decision largely inspired by yourself, Mr Almunia – is a step in the right direction."
"It is not enough, however, to reassure people that the European Union is capable of adopting a strategy that will bring lasting revival to the economy."
"We cannot separate the debate on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact and hence on the coordination of economic and budgetary policies from the debate on the financial perspectives."
"How can you cut the Member States’ deficits unless, in return, the European Union gives itself the budgetary resources to guarantee social cohesion and revive the European economy?"
"Personally, I do not believe that budget austerity in the Member States combined with budget inertia in the Union is the answer to the twin challenges of growth and employment."
"I would therefore like to say that it is now time, at the stage we have now reached, to speak about increasing and diversifying the Union’s resources, even if that means amending the Treaties to allow the Union to take out the loans and raise the European tax that our current economic and political crisis demands."
"Mr President, allow me to put the following question to the House: would we be experiencing the current crisis in the European Union if economic growth and job creation were strong here, if the large European countries were offering us a different profile, if they were promoting the whole of the European Union and contributing to balancing the world economy?"
"Surely the answer would be ‘no’."
"There would be resources, there would be money to fund enlargement, for the challenges of the European Union."
"But there is no economic growth because there is no confidence."
"And there is no confidence because we lack determination when it comes to applying and implementing confidence and stability policies."
"That is the contribution of the Stability Pact."
"Its reform, Mr Almunia, comes at a complicated time."
"The next thing now under threat in this crisis in the European Union is the euro."
"The reform of the Stability Pact must therefore be the right reform."
"Mr Karas has done an excellent job trying to remedy a mistaken proposal on the basic content of the Stability Pact."
"Mr Almunia has told us tonight that the Commission is satisfied with Parliament's position on improving the quality of statistics and the surveillance of debt."
"I would also like to hear from Mr Almunia that he is in agreement with the listing of relevant factors, which are extremely important if the Stability Pact is not to be a box in which we can fit everything, and in which, at the end of the day, the rules can be ignored."
"We have reached a situation in which each country does what it sees fit in order to promote the policy of budgetary stability and, if relevant factors are undefined, this would be practically impossible."
"We have an example within the European Union of Fifteen: the countries which have done their duty in budgetary terms are the ones which today are enjoying economic growth and employment."
"We do not have to look for models elsewhere. We should identify those countries within the European Union and all apply those policies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe’s citizens continue to point the finger at the Stability and Growth Pact and the single currency as the real culprits of the ongoing economic and social crisis in Europe."
"At the same time, European politicians of almost all ideological hues trot out the same politically-correct rhetoric, extolling the virtues of restrictive fiscal policies and of the overriding obsession with price moderation."
"This contradiction must stop and this is now the real challenge that the European institutions must meet head on."
"The Council and the Commission recently took steps to tackle this dilemma, including the relaunch of the Pact and the regulations that we are discussing in this House."
"Parliament, in turn, does what it can with the powers that it has. The rapporteur should be warmly commended for raising a number of concerns such as construction fault, the reliability of statistics, relevant factors, the deadlines for correcting deficits and the stepping up of budgetary surveillance."
"In spite of these steps and the undoubted quality of your work, Commissioner, it remains to be seen whether these remedies have come in time and whether they will be sufficient."
"Pangloss said that we live in the best of all possible worlds, but in 1755 there was a terrible earthquake in Lisbon, which had a profound effect on political and economic relations in Europe in the 18th century."
"We have a duty at least to reflect on this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically everything has been said, but not by everyone and, more to the point, not by me."
"Firstly, I should like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks."
"He has made the best of a bad job, and on that, I might perhaps be permitted to comment."
"Today is the third time I have stood on this podium in order to speak on the Stability Pact."
"In 1997, Parliament had to give its opinion on the introduction of the euro and the Stability Pact associated with it at the time."
"We did so gladly, because we were convinced that the Stability Pact offered a basis of trust for the citizens."
"This time, as the rapporteur rightly said, the European Parliament has only a minor role in the whole procedure."
"Consultation means something different in my view."
"Monetary questions are questions of trust and this trust is shaken by the watering down of the Pact."
"The two so-called big countries – in what the rapporteur calls 'peer complicity' – set the entire watering down process in motion, as we have already heard here today."
"Big gestures, big overtures obviously no longer convince the citizens of Europe."
"The shattered remains of the Schröder and Eichel policy in Germany and the Chirac policy in France have drawn the euro into this completely negative discussion."
"The report formulated by the rapporteur is a desperate attempt to rescue some of the philosophy behind stability."
"We must stop exacerbating the crisis of confidence still further."
"The best solution would be if Mr Barroso, and Mr Juncker on behalf of ECOFIN, were to withdraw all changes to the Stability Pact in the light of recent developments."
"For Hungary, like all the new Member States, meeting the convergence criteria is a key requirement, as well as being in the country’s own interests."
"In its efforts to do so, it must take into account the fact that alongside the overall positive economic impact of EU accession, it also puts considerable transitional pressure on the government budget."
"There are costs involved in meeting its contribution obligations and getting the new institutional network up and running, while outstanding customs and other revenues and implementation of new, more flexible VAT regulations have caused a serious deficit."
"At the same time, it is not the budget itself that is the beneficiary of the projects funded by the EU that are so important for the national economy, but the local authorities, institutions, or companies concerned; the burden of cofinancing, meanwhile, must be met out of the government budget."
"We want to be successful members of a successful European Union and so we accept these transitional pressures and ask that they be taken into consideration when it comes to assessing our performance."
". Mr President, I would like once again to thank Mr Karas for his reports and all the Members who have spoken in the debate for their contributions."
"Of all the contributions, I would like to refer to two of them, in particular those that have demonstrated the success of the euro, of the single currency, and I feel I should point out, at a time when certain statements appear to have called into question something that is obvious; that the euro has brought stability, solvency, historically low prices, that the euro has brought us historically low interest rates, that the euro is making us stronger."
"This should be pointed out because, immediately afterwards, I must say that in order to maintain that strong single currency which strengthens us as Europeans in economic terms and in other terms requires a fiscal framework and a Stability and Growth Pact such as the one defined in the Treaty and provided for by the regulations that this Parliament is discussing today through its partial amendments."
"I would also like to express my agreement with those of you who have reacted to certain pessimistic analyses."
"It is true that there are economic difficulties, that there are growth and employment problems, that the citizens often feel that their needs are not sufficiently met."
"But it is also the case that when we are looked at from the outside, or when the situation of the European economies is looked at objectively, there is also cause for optimism."
"At the meeting of the Eurogroup the day before yesterday, the Director of the International Monetary Fund’s European Department explained to us the general lines of the reports that it has just published and that can be consulted on the International Monetary Fund's website on the economy of the euro zone."
"He began by telling us that he is surprised about the excessive pessimism, since, on analysing the European economy, he has noted that the conditions are in place to allow it to recover fully."
"There is a problem with confidence in some of the main European economies and one of the objectives of the reform of the Stability Pact is undoubtedly to increase the confidence in, and credibility of, a necessary framework of fiscal and budgetary discipline."
"To this end, this reform is balanced; it introduces certain elements of flexibility, but it also introduces greater demands -- particularly in the preventive part, regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1466/97."
"It is a reform that requires more transparency and it has therefore contributed to the adoption of important decisions aimed at improving the quality of our statistics."
"Furthermore, on the proposal of the Commission, Ecofin yesterday approved certain very important conclusions which indicate the improvements that are being made to the European statistical system and, in particular, to fiscal statistics."
"Restoring confidence also requires a clear explanation."
"In many of your comments, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted an understanding of the Pact and of what the reform of the Pact means."
"In others, I have recognised ignorance or lack of knowledge or, in some cases, simply an interpretation that is not in line with reality: the reform of the Pact cannot be accused of repeating literally what the Treaty says, because what would jeopardise confidence would be to go against the Treaty."
"To act in accordance with the Treaty, to repeat what the Treaty says with regard to the reference value for public deficit, to the reference value for public debt and to all the factors that must be taken into account Article 143 of the Treaty lays down the relevant factors to be taken into account when analysing a country's excessive deficit situation to comply fully with the Treaty in every respect, to re-read carefully the Treaty approved in order to implement the Economic and Monetary Union, is one of the elements that will do most to restore confidence in the euro zone and throughout the whole of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"In any event, I am convinced that this reform we are discussing today - and that I hope will enter into force at the end of this month - respects the rules, introduces clarity, economic rationality, demands equal treatment and will be applied rigorously, as was demonstrated yesterday."
"And what it requires from all of us is an accurate and full explanation of what it means, and in that way we will help the European citizens and the European project."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Dominique Vlasto, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on strengthening European competitiveness: the effects of industrial change on policy and the role of SMEs [2004/2154(INI)] (A6-0148/2005)"
"Mr President, the report I am presenting to you this evening confirms the return of an ambition, the ambition of an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe."
"It was both necessary and essential."
"We need to go further, however."
"The time is short so far as industrial policy is concerned and we need to go faster and move from ambition to action."
"Last week I was in Shanghai with the delegation from the city of Marseille."
"Industry is the backbone of China’s development."
"Innovation and new technologies are the vehicles of that industry’s development, and economic growth there is ongoing."
"In a word, the dynamism of that society is enough to make you dizzy."
"Of course, I do not want a Chinese-style development model for the European Union; but I would like our Europe to have the means to hold its own against the economic giants of the United States, China, India and others."
"Above all, our challenge must therefore be to be competitive through innovation and by investing in research, know-how and knowledge."
"The Commission and Vice-President Verheugen are making a lot of proposals along these lines."
"What we are looking for now is for these proposals to be made political reality, and it is in this light that this report and its contents should be considered."
"First of all, we think a policy should set itself objectives that lend it significance, like the development of a sound European industrial base, increasing employment, especially for young people, and the emergence of European industrial champions able to act as standard bearers for the ‘Made in Europe’ brand."
"European industrial policy must also, however, be aimed at all enterprises and become a full part of the Lisbon strategy."
"The Commission is focusing on a sectoral approach: we are pleased about that because it is essential that part of industrial policy should take account of the distinctive nature of each sector in the way it is implemented."
"An effective policy must also take account of the nature of enterprises, however, because only 1% of European enterprises are large groups, while there are millions of other small and medium-sized enterprises that make up Europe’s industrial fabric."
"The Commission must make a real effort to take small enterprises into account."
"The second dimension that must not be overlooked is the territorial dimension."
"Industry acts as a magnet for other economic activities, making its location a key factor in the development of many regions."
"The Structural Funds must therefore support industrial development while at the same time acting as instruments to assist the reconversion of areas suffering from industrial relocation."
"We must bring a specific response to this problem of relocations, assess the sectors at risk, anticipate relocations and help to regenerate the regions affected."
"We must also take account of the existing differences between the 25 countries of the European Union."
"Finally, we believe that every policy must be based on a clear and effective method, and that is particularly true, Mr Verheugen, of your commitment to better lawmaking."
"We are looking for a way of simplifying legislation that takes account of the cumulative effects of legislation on individual sectors."
"We are hoping for a method of studying the impact of proposed legislation that will take account of SMEs and, in particular, use precise criteria to evaluate the responses made to Commission consultations."
"I would add that Parliament and the Council also have their parts to play and that they should be actively involved in the better lawmaking objective."
"As you can no doubt see, Mr Verheugen, our expectations are high."
"For many instruments of industrial policy, they depend in part on the outcome of the negotiations on the financial perspectives; they also depend on our ability to make use of the instruments we already have, such as competition policy, education, the allocation of State aids or commercial policy."
"I hope our Parliament’s contribution will help this challenge to be taken up."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that we are debating this evening is completely in line with the Commission's beliefs and with the policy that we are pursuing and I am therefore exceptionally grateful for the support of the European Parliament."
"First of all, we needed to make sure in Europe that industrial policy in general is seen once more as a political task."
"We had to clarify that we in Europe cannot manage without a strong, efficient industrial base and that it is a mistake to believe that we can live from services alone."
"This has already been achieved."
"Secondly, we need to ensure that European industry retains its long-term edge in increasingly fierce, and increasingly global, competition."
"That is the main thrust of the new growth and employment strategy which the Commission has tabled and which Parliament adopted by a large majority."
"What we are trying to do here, above all, is to improve our innovative skills."
"European industry can survive worldwide and generate growth and jobs only if 'made in Europe' indicates a top-of-the-range product."
"We cannot compete through lower social standards, lower environmental standards or lower wages; we need to compete through efficiency, quality and technological progress."
"Thirdly, we must analyse very carefully where our industry has structural problems."
"I shall shortly be submitting a communication containing a precise analysis of the industrial sectors in Europe and explaining what individual steps are needed in order to improve the competitive chances of European industry."
"Everyone can see that the automobile industry and the chemical industry do not have the same problems, any more than do the textile industry and the tooling industry."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur for emphasising the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which I regard as the focal point of our efforts; there are 25 million of them, and the European economy thrives on their flexibility and capacity for innovation."
"We should always bear in mind that new jobs in Europe are created in this sector and in this sector alone."
"The advances in productivity made by European industry mean that, in years to come, no new jobs will be created in industry."
"Jobs are only being created by small and medium-sized enterprises, which is why we must help them to overcome their structural problems. That means access to risk capital, access to knowledge and skills and innovation and an improved business environment, basically in the form of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The density of regulations that we have achieved in numerous sectors in Europe is quite simply too much for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why I am making an announcement today that is also directed at the European Parliament."
"This Commission takes the 'better lawmaking' project very seriously."
"This does not only mean that we shall improve the quality of lawmaking, it also means that we shall say no much more often in future."
"We shall say no to demands from the ranks of the Member States for regulations which are not necessary and I shall also say no if demands come from the European Parliament – and this is, unfortunately, often the case – for regulation which we do not need and the same Parliament then criticises the Commission because it over-regulates."
"You are going to see a new Commission here."
"We shall say ‘no’ where over-regulation is being set in motion and we shall see how the European public reacts."
"I wait with anticipation and I am counting on your assistance."
"Healthy self-regulation in the field of lawmaking is what the citizens of Europe expect of us at the moment."
"It is also what our economy needs in order to improve its chances of growth and its investment potential."
"Compared to large enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have special requirements for competitive development, so they need to be given special attention when policies are being formulated."
"Industrial policy should be no exception, since industrial development based on knowledge is not limited to large enterprises."
"Greater financial resources for research, for instance, still do not guarantee a greater number of innovations, and this is why we need the enterprising spirit embodied in SME’s."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are not merely the driving force of economic growth."
"We must be aware that they also represent an opportunity for the European Union in the political sense."
"They also carry a political charge, since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands is, amongst other things, a consequence of the fact that the people of Europe do not feel the direct effects of the workings and decisions of European institutions."
"Something similar is also true of SME’s, which lack their own resources to exploit the advantages offered by the European Union."
"In the report, therefore, as the European Parliament we are giving particular support to institutional measures that will strengthen the innovative capacity of SME’s."
"We are in favour of the European Union giving priority to mutually linked processes such as research, education and the elimination of administrative barriers, which present particular obstacles to small and medium-sized enterprises in exploiting the opportunities offered by the EU."
"Commissioner, in formulating the report we collaborated very enthusiastically with Members from the new Member States."
"Indeed we are aware that industrial policy may serve as an opportunity both for the geographically larger old Member States, which have the conditions for the development of industrial heavyweights, and for the new Member States, which can with their dynamic sectors of innovative SME’s represent the basis for high economic growth and for raising European competitiveness in the long term."
". Mr President, Commissioner, several assessments suggest that uncertainty, particularly with regard to employment and social protection, has been a significant reason why many citizens have rejected the Constitutional Treaty in France and in the Netherlands."
"After many years during which the words ‘industrial policy’ had disappeared, today they are making a reappearance, and we should all be pleased about this because it is by promoting a solid industrial sector that the citizens will be able to find better paid and more stable jobs."
"That is the way to contribute to increasing confidence in the European project."
"The Commission’s Communication proposes an integrated approach, which includes the simplification and harmonisation of legislation in order to consolidate the internal market, and supports R+D and the need to promote its transfer to companies."
"But that harmonisation should also include a fiscal dimension."
"The European industrial fabric is made up of diverse sectors, ranging from the aerospace industry to the textile industry, and they require specific responses."
"Sectoral analyses will help to facilitate greater cooperation between industry, the Commission and the Member States, which could create new opportunities."
"Small and medium-sized businesses make up 90% of European industry and they require special attention in terms of their access to funding and transfer of research."
"Relocation is, on occasions, an inevitable reality and we must anticipate those changes."
"To that end, we must create a dialogue that includes the administration and the social and economic actors and that takes account of the available research and innovation instruments."
"And, of course, an adjustment fund will be essential in order to accompany restructurings."
"I would like to end by congratulating the Commission, because it has proposed the appropriate instruments for increasing European competitiveness and has done so within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"But if we want the citizens to see the Union’s policies as an instrument for making progress and not as a threat, we must maintain the balance between the three pillars of that strategy, that is to say, the economic, the social and the environmental pillars."
". Mr President, I very much enjoyed listening to all that Mrs Vlasto and Commissioner Verheugen had to say."
"I cannot comment on what has been said in this Chamber today, however, as I feel obliged to comment on what is written in the report."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that it does nothing whatsoever to advocate healthy competition, which is the cornerstone of a free economy."
"Instead, it is riddled through and through with interventionist ideology."
"Paragraph 1 reads as follows, ‘[The European Parliament] welcomes the Commission’s decision to make industrial policy a priority of the EU agenda’."
"I would ask the House to remember that there is no such thing as priorities in a free economy."
"Society’s needs dictate everything that is necessary in such an economy, and the free market tells us what those needs are."
"To discuss priorities for the economy would be to neglect the economy as a whole."
"To quote paragraph 2, ‘[The European Parliament supports] the promotion of a proactive industrial policy’."
"With all due respect, if it needs to be said that any aspect of the economy should be proactive, then I have to say that we have taken a very wrong turning indeed."
"After all, this would imply that we already regard freedom as a non-essential feature of the economy, and yet a free economy is the foundation for success."
"Paragraph 5 says, and I quote, ‘social dialogue should help to identify the best-performing sectors’."
"I would remind the House that deciding whether something is performing well, or whether those running businesses are adhering rather too diligently to healthy free-market principles, is no job for social dialogue."
"Moving on to paragraph 6, ‘[The European Parliament] would like to see women encouraged to train for industrial careers’."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gross corruption of feminist ideals."
"There is no point in encouraging women to train for industrial careers, since they will find jobs in whichever sector they wish."
"I see no reason why women should have to work with pneumatic drills."
"Paragraph 12 reads as follows, ‘industrial policy should lead to balanced development, by maintaining social cohesion’."
"I would remind the House that this is the wrong path to take if we wish to achieve competitiveness and success."
"One hundred and thirty years ago, the then British Prime Minister said that the job of economists was to prevent the government from harming the economy."
"At the time Britain was the fastest developing country in the world."
"I am far from hopeful that the European Commission will follow my advice, but I would call on it to take my comments into consideration, if nothing else."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise that the refrain of ‘enhancing European competitiveness’ has been repeated for many years."
"It is time to make it clear that achieving a global economy is an extremely challenging goal, but an absolutely essential one."
"This leads us to a number of conclusions, the most important of which is that precise and detailed implementation plans and timetables must be drawn up for all issues raised and measures taken."
"In view of the limited funding available, it is important to establish which goals and priorities should be focused on, for example the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the global economy, whilst at the same time safeguarding environmental protection and job security."
"Particular priority should be given to science and research programmes and training measures in the field of new technologies and new generations of products and services, as well as to productivity, potential savings and access to research for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work on this well-balanced report."
"The Lisbon Strategy clearly identifies the need to improve the competitiveness of European industry as a priority for the European Union."
"I should like to remind the Commissioner, however, that we must also consider the following aspects in order to meet these objectives."
"Firstly, unnecessary administration and red tape within the European Union must be eliminated."
"European institutions must reduce and simplify legislation governing businesses operating in the industrial sector, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"National legislation should play the key role, while the European Union’s industrial policy should be limited only to necessary coordination and harmonisation."
"Secondly, emphasis must be given to supporting and encouraging small and medium-sized businesses in the industrial sector."
"The SME sector has provided clear evidence of its flexibility, and the latter is the key prerequisite for attaining a necessary and sustainable degree of competitiveness, both in Europe and on the global market."
"This is why I cannot entirely agree with the policy of supporting ‘national champions’."
"This approach of supporting the creation of a small number of large dominant companies would obviously tie up significant funding from the EU budget, and would probably violate the principles of healthy competition, without there being any guarantee of it having a positive impact on the competitiveness of such companies."
"Thirdly, small and medium-sized companies in the industrial sector need new incentives for further technological development, research and innovation."
"The planned programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and others, must, however, be much more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises than has been the case to date."
"More structural funds must also be allocated to less-developed regions and the new Member States, in order to enable them to build adequate technical infrastructures with a view to improving the industrial base in these regions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Vlasto report contains mature and balanced deliberations that mark a new stage in the debate on Europe’s industrial policy, which is currently in crisis."
"At the same time, citizens are expressing irrational fears and frustrations, for example in the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"Outsourcing has become a fact of life."
"Even though ostensible economic justifications are put forward for this phenomenon, there can be no question that it is harmful to society."
"Whenever we discuss outsourcing, however, we must remember that this term covers a variety of practices, including both outsourcing within the EU, which brings advantages in terms of positive synergy, and outsourcing outside the EU, which brings nothing but disadvantages."
"What the EU needs is a homogeneous market in products and services that is highly competitive in global terms and highly innovative."
"Two types of mechanisms exist for enhancing competitiveness."
"The first are simple mechanisms that limit the benefits of the so-called European social model, and the second are complex mechanisms based on intellectual and social capital that serve as a foundation for organisational, technological, technical and market innovation."
"Europe should follow the examples of Japan and late-1960s Europe by relocalising, or in other words by bringing modern production activities and capital back to the common European market."
"Such relocalisation is urgently needed in order to protect intellectual property, to help Europe regain its lead in the field of know-how, to create jobs and to enhance the competitiveness of European capital."
"All these things are possible, but they are dependent on Europe extricating itself from stagnation and bringing about GDP growth of at least several percentage points."
"A number of instruments exist that would undoubtedly encourage relocalisation."
"Contrary to the views of those for whom the proverbial Polish plumber and bricklayer mean nothing but fear and frustration, these include the full liberalisation of commercial services, as advocated by the Polish socialists."
"They also include the establishment of industrial clusters around centres of innovation and the introduction of the principle that all government purchases should be ‘made in Europe’."
"An EU directive would need to be drafted on this last point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Vlasto for this report."
"It is one of some importance for me, as I myself ran a business in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector for many years."
"The experience I gained in this field means that I can take a practical approach to European competitiveness and the SME sector."
"It is my belief that the European economy is in urgent need of genuine competition and of developing a better understanding of economic issues amongst the citizens of Europe."
"The first of these tasks was enshrined in the Lisbon strategy among the EU’s key objectives, one of the aims of which was to eliminate economic differences between the old and the new Member States."
"Businesses from the new Member States, and in particular the SME sectors in these countries, which are both flexible and capable of adapting to changing conditions, offer significant potential for economic development in Europe."
"A number of conditions have to be met before this potential can be tapped, however."
"These include doing away with existing obstacles to the internal market, of which there are currently around 90, the creation of an environment that is more conducive to SME start-ups and the linking of wages to labour productivity and efficiency."
"I believe that employment levels will rise if we create a climate that is conducive to the development of the SME sector, and if we simplify regulations and adopt new ones."
"Liberalisation of the market in services will serve as a further catalyst for economic development in Europe, and also represents a source of new jobs."
"Furthermore, I believe that public understanding of economic issues must be improved."
"People will only stop fearing change and see that change is necessary for improved quality of life if they can understand the economic mechanisms that impact on their lives."
"Developing a knowledge-based economy is the only means of enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy."
"This means investment in research, development and business-based innovation, as SME development will only be achieved on the back of such investment."
"There is therefore a need for education and training systems that reflect the needs of the labour market, and for the idea of life-long learning to gain public acceptance."
"This report may well be a key factor in the development of the European economy and genuine free competition."
"I will therefore vote in favour of it, and I would suggest that the SME sector be acknowledged as the driving force behind the economy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing takes on particular importance at a time like this, when a large part of Europe is in a situation of economic and social difficulties."
"Those difficulties are undermining the European Union’s competitiveness, and highlight a gap in productivity compared with the United States and Japan, low levels of investment and research and development, low levels of innovation, particularly as regards high technology, and the delocation of research activities."
"All of this needs to be addressed."
"Over and again, we have said that it needs to be done by relaunching the Lisbon Strategy, but that Strategy will continue to fade away if we do not invest seriously and forcefully in industrial policy."
"I must say, Commissioner, that the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is still below expectations."
"It seems to be a summary of what already exists, whilst what we need are significant innovations."
"This evening we heard that you will present a new communication: we hope that it contains the required innovations."
"Choices need to be made in the context of general economic policy, completing the internal market and the reform policies on government administration, and the taxation system and infrastructures."
"Aside from that, however, a governance plan needs to be worked on, in order to enable all of the existing institutional levels to interact in cooperation with one another."
"There needs to be awareness of the necessity of investing in sectoral policies and in horizontal policies in order to promote small and medium-sized enterprises, which form a substantial part of the European Union."
"Finally, the so-called virtuous circles – universities, industrial districts and research laboratories – need to be built and enlarged."
"I am talking about innovation ‘incubators’, which are vital to industrial policy."
"In short, we need to change up a gear – as soon as possible – if we want the European Union to become the more competitive and dynamic area that we have outlined as an objective for some time."
"– Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Vlasto, achieved very broad agreement in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"She has illuminated every corner, but this report – like so many things that we adopt here – lacks the spark that is needed to ignite a new industrial policy."
"I should like to say how much I agree with Mr Libicki: the regulatory framework still needs scrutinising, which is why this report, to my regret, will be unable to have the effect that it really needs."
"Mr Verheugen said that, as part of the better lawmaking project, the Commission will, in future, say ‘no’ more often, specifically to Parliament and the Member States."
"He forgot to mention the Commission itself."
"You could make a start there, by going through those proposals that have not been implemented for fifteen years, by implementing competitiveness in consumer protection and environmental protection within the Commission itself."
"These are starting points enough and, in my opinion, every European measure, as the President of the Commission once suggested, should pass three tests: the cost test, the competitiveness test and the subsidiarity test."
"On this point, I agree with Mr Hudacký, who said that there should be no regulation in areas for which the nation states have jurisdiction."
"The question before us is how Europe decides between competing and cutting itself off."
"Does increased competitive pressure act as a fitness programme for Europe's economy or has the old Europe long been economically sidelined?"
"The challenges are huge."
"It is my belief that the core of Europe is too full for international competition and is therefore opting to cut itself off and be sidelined."
"That is where we must start."
"Europe is under competitive pressure from above and from below."
"On the one hand, we are too expensive and, on the other hand, we are not productive enough in order to be able to afford the high costs."
"That will only be improved by the new incoming national economies."
"The new Member States are bringing us this competition."
"That is the important gift of enlargement: more competition and hence a proper industrial policy."
"This is what we urgently need, not more new European programmes that get us nowhere and ultimately obscure the regulatory framework."
"Mr President, I am a believer in three things: the European economy, European industry and the ability of European industry to be competitive."
"Unfortunately, however, we often applaud the notion of competitivity, while supporting initiatives which erode that very competitivity."
"For instance, the Commissioner has rightly indicated that we sometimes tend to be over-regulated and this adds to bureaucracy and to the cost of production."
"Sometimes we are not aware that we are eroding competitivity by our own ideas and legislation."
"Recently, we lowered the limit in the Working Time Directive."
"This is obviously something which is paradoxical to competitivity."
"Sometimes we talk about investments in technological innovation and we are dependent on private-public partnership."
"That is the way the argument is put forward."
"Europe is not an ideal model for private-public partnership."
"We try to restrict research on the basis of vague moral issues."
"Finally, as well as encouraging further investment in innovation and research, there is a trend against patents."
"We must realise that we have to choose our priorities."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to welcome this refreshing acknowledgment in competition policy and in the debate on industrial policy of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises to jobs and the competitiveness of the European Union."
"This acknowledgment in today's debate also shows that every attempt to play industrial policy off against SME policy is wrong, harmful and contradicts reality."
"We need industrial flagships if we are to be competitive in the world and we need clusters of SMEs and industrial flagships in order that SMEs may derive competitive impetus from the competitiveness of industry."
"While I agree with you when you say ‘no’ to more regulation, we must at the same time say ‘no’ to the tendency towards more nationalisation, ‘no’ to the tendency towards anti-efficiency, ‘no’ to the tendency towards despondency, ‘no’ to populism, ‘no’ to amending legislation, ‘no’ to anti-industrialism and ‘yes’ to more efficiency, ‘yes’ to the internal market, ‘yes’ to the four freedoms, which Werner Langen touched on."
"Enlargement strengthens the internal market."
"The internal market strengthens competitiveness. That also means yes to the Services Directive."
"But that also means a stronger commitment to tax policy."
"That means a stronger commitment in the financial perspectives to research, education, growth and employment and to new companies."
"For me, this naturally means that we must encourage the best so that we can be there for the weak."
"Mediocrity must be driven out of Europe."
"The new type of nationalisation in mind must be driven out of our policy."
"The apportioning of blame between state and Europe must be driven out in order to allow this competitiveness, this innovation, this research, this will to achieve more through efficiency."
"I trust here that deeds will follow today's debate and the announcements made, because that is the only way to achieve new dynamism in the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in extender oils and tyres (twenty-seventh amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC) (COM(2004)0098 - C5-0081/2004 - 2004/0036(COD)) (A6-0104/2005)"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for having turned your attention to this important but also highly technical issue and for proposing constructive amendments."
"We must in fact make every reasonable effort to reduce emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in order to protect health and the environment."
"These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances."
"According to the UNECE protocol, they are also classified as persistent organic pollutants."
"However, these particular hydrocarbons are ingredients in extender oils used in the production of tyres and therefore cause health and environmental problems."
"That is why the Commission has proposed introducing harmonised restrictions on the marketing and use of oils containing these PAKs, and on tyres containing these oils."
"The Commission proposal will ensure that the internal market in tyres is maintained and that national measures which create trade barriers to the free movement of goods are avoided."
"Alternatives to the substances to be restricted are being developed by industry."
"In order to give industry the time needed to adjust to the new standards laid down in this directive, the Commission has proposed a reasonable transition period for the transposition of the directive."
"Parliament and the Council have tabled a workable compromise package, with amendments on the later introduction of measures and testing requirements and deleting unnecessary exemptions for certain sectors."
"The Commission supports these amendments."
"I would like to encourage Parliament to accept the proposal at first reading, together with the amendments forming part of this compromise package."
"This will demonstrate that the European institutions are willing and able to address such problems without delay."
". – Mr President, Madam Vice-President, today we are debating the 27th amendment to Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in extender oils and tyres."
"This is an important development, if you consider that the European tyre industry produces around 300 million tyres annually and uses 250 000 tonnes of extender oils, which are incorporated into the rubber matrix and remain in the rubber used for the end tyre."
"These oils contain certain quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, as well as persistent organic pollutants."
"I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its initiative to extend Annex 1 to Directive 76/769 by the addition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to car tyres."
"I consider that its proposal is a very good proposal."
"Taking as a starting point the protection of public health and the environment, as well as public safety and the smooth functioning of the internal market, and following consultations both with the Commission and the Council, as well as with the tyre and oil industry and non-governmental organisations, I tried to draft a balanced report, which was amended accordingly by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The main issues which concerned us were the duration of the transitional period for the application of the directive, the method of detecting the toxic substances which would be used and the question of exemptions from the directive."
"Following consultations with the Council and in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, a package of amendments was proposed, which has been endorsed by most of the political groups."
"As you can see, I have recommended the tabled amendments, so that we can bring this matter to a smooth conclusion at first reading."
"In detail and as regards the transitional period, which is considered necessary in order to develop new types of tyres with extender oils which contain the minimum quantity of the substances which concern us, it is proposed that it be extended to 1 January 2010."
"We should point out here that, for environmental reasons, we decided to take account of the date of manufacture of the tyre, which is marked on the tyre itself."
"That is because the destruction of tyres remaining in stock is also harmful – perhaps even more harmful – to the environment and, of course, we are also helping industry to dispose of these stocks."
"The European Federation of Tyre Manufacturers has assured us in writing that it can apply the criteria in the directive to all types of tyres, including tyres for racing cars, aeroplanes and special vehicles and vintage cars, without any risk to driver safety."
"We therefore propose that there should be no exemption in the application of the directive."
"Today I received three faxes protesting that we should grant extensions."
"I have spoken to all three senders and, when I explained the compromise proposal, they appeared to agree with it."
"One of them even apologised for his ignorance."
"As regards the methods for detecting and defining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Commission has proposed limiting the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene, the substance which will act as a marker for the entire group, to 1 mg per kilogramme or, taking all listed PAHs, to no more than 10 mg per kilogramme."
"In the past, industry has used IP 346 method of the Institute of Petroleum for PAC-dimethyl sulfoxide extract, which must not exceed 3%."
"Its inclusion has been proposed, given that it is the traditional method used."
"So much for extender oils."
"As far as the oil content in car tyres is concerned, as ISO 21461 method has been developed in order to detect this type of oils in tyres, it is proposed that it be defined in the directive as an addendum to the Commission proposal."
"Finally, the last amendment concerns retreading, on which the Commission proposal contains no provisions."
"Tread for retreading may not be placed on the market if it contains extender oils exceeding the limits indicated."
"To close, I should like to thank both the shadow rapporteurs, for their excellent cooperation, and the secretarial staff of the Committee on the Environment, as well as the Council for its constructive proposals and cooperation, which will allow us to bring this matter to a close at first reading."
". Mr President, I hope the Commissioner has finished texting everybody to say that they have got the tyre manufacturers sorted out."
"Obviously he has not, as he is not listening to what we are saying."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"It was a difficult and very technical report and required a certain amount of skill."
"I also wish to congratulate the tyre manufacturers, because over the years they have improved road safety, the availability of tyres and also the tread and the capacity of the tyre to stick to the road."
"That was why I know that my fellow rapporteur had a slight problem with the date 2010."
"I realise that he wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal of 2009, but a number of tyres could not be changed for that date and that is why we opted for the date on the tyre."
"I am delighted to hear that he has accepted that."
"It is good that the Commission and the Council have accepted, because we have come forward with a compromise package for its acceptance."
"Particularly in the current climate, after the French and the Dutch votes, people often see the Council and the Commission – the Commission in particular – as aloof from Parliament, the only democratically elected body that represents the electorate."
"Mr Adamou quite rightly mentioned Annex I and I am grateful to him for going through all the technical details for something we totally accept and agree with."
"This report is a triumph for Parliament and I am delighted that we have come up with a compromise package."
"I am just sorry the Commissioner is unable to listen to what we are saying and is too busy texting people."
". Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"He has consulted painstakingly and taken due note of the views expressed by all the main players."
"In addition, I commend the productive efforts and efficient methodology employed in bringing about full and genuine cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs for all the main political groups."
"This has led to the achievement of a compromise package of amendments, which appears to have been widely accepted by most parliamentary groups, the Council and the Commission."
"Concerning the substance of the directive, with the compromise amendments, this will to a very large degree achieve the intended aims, i.e., to effect, as soon as practicably possible, a reduction in the emission of carcinogenic tyre debris into the environment to an acceptable level, by restricting the marketing and use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-rich extender oils and tyres."
"That would be done by harmonising the rules on the marketing and use of extender oils and tyres containing these toxic substances, thus preserving and improving the conditions and functioning of the internal market, while making sure that a high degree of health and environmental protection is achieved."
"Lastly, it should be mentioned that there have, sadly, been a few direct and indirect attempts by some transatlantic tyre manufacturers to manipulate the derailing of the effectiveness clause of this directive."
"It is to the credit of the rapporteur and the shadows that fortunately logic and a sense of preservation of the EU’s high standards of safety and efficiency prevailed and such attempts fortunately failed."
"That is a good example, demonstrating clearly that unity and common sense will always protect us against the ‘big brother’ approach sometimes propagated by a small number of US industrialists and politicians."
"In conclusion, I strongly urge you to vote in favour of the compromise amendment package presented to you in connection with Mr Adamou’s report."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the compromise struck."
"The fact that most groups but also the Commission, the Council and industry are nearly all of the same mind is the result of sound work put in by Mr Adamou."
"Yesterday, I, along with others apparently, was approached by an aircraft tyre manufacturer who informed me that the extensive tests and security requirements to which aircraft tyres are subjected will make it impossible for him to keep to the 2010 deadline."
"I assume that the rapporteur and Commissioner have also been approached, and I should like to know whether those objections have any real value."
"I would also like to hear from the Commissioner what his opinion is on the matter and whether aircraft tyre manufacturers are now able to meet the requirements of the compromise package."
"I was under the impression, from my contacts over the past six months, that that should be feasible, but I am very keen to hear your reaction."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work in support of the Commission’s policy and the excellent compromise he has proposed."
"As the Commission line is broadly acceptable, Parliament should support it without watering down the issue to any greater extent."
"The legislative initiative under discussion is a natural extension to the directive that was drafted in Parliament’s last term and in which we laid down limit and target values for impurities in the air and PAHs for 1996."
"As we now decide a suitable timetable and limit values for PAH emissions passing into the rest of the environment, we have a challenging task before us."
"PAHs are everywhere and they occur as multicomponent blends."
"In international toxicology assessments several carcinogenic compounds have been identified among PAHs."
"PAHs do not dissolve in water, they accumulate in the food chain, and they return to the carbon cycle when released into the environment, thus causing lasting damage to nature."
"Accordingly, we should agree common testing procedures in order to bring emissions under control swiftly."
"For a long time now development and testing work has been conducted on tyres, and, indeed, the first tyres containing a safer oil are already on the market."
"Traffic, in which the tyres that are used and the limit values for their extender oils we now want to regulate, is in itself ecologically problematic."
"Traffic emissions are one of the commonest and worst spreaders of PAHs into the air we breathe."
"It is from tyre debris in particular that large quantities of compounds in the form of small particles are released into the environment."
"A particular problem with tyres and extender oils is benzopyrene, which, unfortunately, is very often used in these products."
"This PAH is the best-known and worst carcinogenic substance."
"We must now define sustainable limit values which will reduce emissions of benzopyrene into the environment to a minimum, at the same time recognising the necessity of extender oils in the tyre industry."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dangerous substances used in the manufacture of tyres for various vehicles."
"Because of their toxicity, we are today debating their restriction."
"We have before us a compromise which will probably be accepted tomorrow by a large majority. Happy though I am when we avoid ideological debates on technical issues and adopt slim directives in a short space of time, there are a couple of minor but important aspects that we have overlooked."
"A proposed amendment, which I jointly initiated and which was originally accepted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, aimed to obtain an extension to 2012 for certain urgently needed technical applications."
"These were exceptions for armoured, fire brigade, rescue and other special purpose vehicles."
"The number of applications is extremely minor and the damage to the environment negligible."
"The original exemption for aircraft tyres, to which no time limit was originally attached, was also buried in the compromise package."
"On this point, Parliament is about to take an irresponsible decision."
"The aviation sector operates at physical limits, which is why the safety aspect must not be compromised and must even come before environmental aspects."
"Industry cannot guarantee that we shall have alternatives available by 2010 which will meet the specific and extremely demanding safety standards for aircraft tyres."
"I fail to understand how the Council could totally disregard this aspect, especially as the European Aviation Safety Agency was not consulted and there has been no follow-up assessment on it."
"I am not in favour of more bureaucracy, but in such a safety sensitive sector as aviation, more careful attention should have been paid to the risks, especially as this is what we do with other regulations in the environmental sector where we often rush past the target."
"I have received a letter from the European Cockpit Association, which represents 34 000 pilots in Europe and expresses great concern about this."
"I wish to highlight this, because the pilots certainly cannot be suspected of engaging in industrial lobbying."
"I would like to know from Commissioner Verheugen whether he is aware of this problem."
"As I see it, this compromise is unacceptable if this aspect is disregarded."
"Mr President, 20 years ago an eminent health pathologist warned that she had never examined a cancerous tumour that did not have chemicals from the benzene family in the active reproducing cancer cells."
"Cancer has become the new Black Plague."
"In the Middle Ages half the population of Europe was destroyed."
"They did not know the source of the bubonic menace and were unable to halt it in its deadly tracks."
"There is no excuse for us; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from."
"We make tyres with them, but we also create them when we burn waste."
"The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators, some for toxic waste, be created in my country, thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water, air, soil, plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc."
"Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators, especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give my views on the questions raised by Mr Blokland and Mr Krahmer, both of whom address the same problem, that being whether there is any guarantee that the requirements applicable to aircraft tyres will be met by the year 2010."
"The reply to Mr Blokland's question is in the negative; no tyre manufacturers have contacted me, nor would I have advised any of them to do so, for they would have received the same reply that I am giving you now."
"The Commission has examined the problem carefully."
"We have received a formal statement from European tyre manufacturers to the effect that the technical requirements of this directive will also be met by the year 2010 for aircraft tyres."
"That is therefore also my reply to Mr Krahmer, whose concerns about the safety of aircraft I fully and completely share."
"I also think that, as far as the composition of tyres is concerned, tyre manufacturers are rather more qualified than pilots."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the Oral Question to the Commission on the Regulation on the Community Patent and related legislation, by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs (B6-0242/2005)"
". – Mr President, Mr Gargani, for whom I am deputising, sends his apologies."
"He had to return to Italy on urgent family business."
"However, as we are very pressed here today, I shall not talk to you for eight minutes."
"I do not consider that this issue requires it."
"Allow me therefore to say a few words on the purpose of this issue."
"A few months ago, we sat together under the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and decided that, as we are having problems – and I use the word advisedly – with a whole series of proposals for legislation in the field of intellectual property rights, it might perhaps make perfect sense if Parliament as a whole were to address this question once more and take this opportunity to discuss this once again with the Commission and – at a later date perhaps – with the Council."
"There is no doubt whatever as to the crucial importance to the European economy of our introducing a permanent single patent in Europe."
"I recall our resolution on the Lisbon process."
"I recall the resolutions which we adopted on this and initiatives in previous years."
"We here always took the view – almost right across the political divide – that the European patent had a particular worth and is of crucial importance, including within the framework of the Lisbon process, if we are to be able to guarantee the competitiveness of the European economy with the economies of other regions of the world."
"However, I will not conceal the fact that some of us – and I in particular – were very concerned at developments in the Council."
"We know that the Council is considering creating a patent which must be translated into all the official languages of the European Union; however, this is as yet unfeasible because unanimity is required and the consent of all the Member States has not been forthcoming."
"Such a patent would be extremely expensive."
"It would not be competitive, nor – if it came about – could it ever be converted back into a normal, proper patent."
"Everyone knows that English is the language that matters and plays an absolutely dominant role in technology and in the granting of patents and that translations into other languages are basically superfluous, achieve nothing and just cost money."
"Once such a language regime has been created, there will be no getting away from it."
"That is the experience in the European Union and that is also the consequence of how legislation is usually passed here on such issues."
"Against this background, I am very concerned as to whether we can and will ultimately get a patent that really can meet the specifications that we have set, including within the framework of the Lisbon process."
"In addition, there is the fact that such an expensive patent would ultimately discriminate against medium-sized businesses, because the few large companies which exist – and they will be not only European but also, above all, non-European companies – will register their patents throughout the Community under this new European patent, while small and medium-sized enterprises – and they account for 70% or more of all patent holders – will be unable to do so because of the costs involved and will have to rely on small, inferior, national patents and regulations under the European Patent Convention."
"This second-class society in patent legislation cannot be what we want in the European Union."
"Given the blockade in the Council and the risk that, if this blockade is lifted, an inferior patent, an inferior patent regulation will emerge, the question which arises is this: what does the Commission – which has the right of initiative and the monopoly on initiatives – propose in the way of possible new initiatives to kickstart this again and perhaps still attain the noble objective of the Lisbon resolutions up to the point at which we have a European patent."
"The second issue which concerns us and which played a considerable role in the report at the time by a 'green' colleague, Mrs Mercedes Echerer from Austria, is the question of collecting societies."
"We in the Committee on Legal Affairs addressed collecting societies on various occasions in the previous legislative period, both within the framework of directives in which they played a role, and in the Echerer own initiative report."
"We came more or less unanimously to the conclusion that it is necessary, when acknowledging the role of collecting societies, both in the decision-making processes of these companies and in fee structures, to achieve an adequate degree of transparency both for the benefit of users and in the interests of the holders of the intellectual property rights."
"We know that the Commission is considering this and has already carried out or is already carrying out a follow-up assessment with a view – and this was also announced in the Commission's legislative programme – to submitting a specific proposal for legislation during the course of this year."
"However, I now hear from the Commission that the question of whether there should be a recommendation or whether a directive is needed is still open."
"I would welcome information from the Commission as to what is happening."
"We know full well that the 'market' at issue here is not of the same order of size as in other cases, but it is nonetheless of importance to the development of the European single market that we clarify this question, ensure there is reasonable transparency in this sector and perhaps also take initiatives in order to facilitate the cross-border use of copyrights."
"There are at last thoughts and activities in this direction also."
"We would be interested in hearing what the Commission intends to do about this."
"Mr President, the main outstanding problems which have so far prevented the incorporation of the Council’s common political approach of March 2003 into the final text of the Community patent regulation concerned the time limit for finding translations of the claims of the patents and the legal effect of these."
"Efforts have been made in the Council and at bilateral level to settle these points."
"Despite substantial agreement between the Member States on this issue under the Irish presidency, none of the solutions discussed has won unanimous support."
"The Commission has already invested a lot of time and effort in work on this file."
"While I am prepared to make one more attempt to reach agreement on the Community patent in the future, I will only do so when I believe the conditions to be favourable."
"However, alongside the Commission’s work on this issue, we also need all supporters of the Community patent to speak out strongly in favour of this initiative."
"As to the collective management of copyright, my services are currently carrying out a thorough impact assessment in preparation for a possible Community initiative."
"The overall aim of such an initiative will be to ensure the more transparent and efficient cross-border management of collective rights in Europe."
"This should provide commercial users, broadcasters, webcasters or other online service providers with better access to information about the scope of the repertoire licence and the applicable terms and tariffs."
"A more transparent management of copyright across the European Union should help stimulate more use being made of copyright content which fosters the development of new attractive services and the technology that is used to provide such services."
"The initiative will take due account of a consultation of stakeholders and of the recommendations of the report written by a former MEP, Mrs Echerer, on collective management of copyright and related rights."
"There is no blockage in the legislative process in this area."
"As far as enhanced cooperation is concerned, any support from the Commission for such an initiative in the field of industrial and intellectual property would depend on its impact on the economy and society and its added value compared to the existing situation."
"Moreover, legal issues, such as those arising from the extent of existing Community competence, would have to be taken into account."
". Mr President, the question of the Committee on Legal Affairs covers two aspects."
"The first, I would say, is the linguistic aspect, which Commissioner McCreevy has referred to, and I would add that things cannot perhaps be simplified as much as my colleague, Mr Lehne, did in his speech."
"Apart from the technological domination of one language that has almost a monopoly, the European Patent Convention recognised other languages, and other languages are also recognised in the European Union Office for Harmonisation of the Internal Market, based in Alicante."
"I have the impression that it is possible that up to a particular level, certain languages may have a degree of recognition, in accordance with the use of patents in those languages and the operation of national patent offices."
"I therefore believe that the issue must be clarified and that, as Mr Lehne has said, the Commission could undoubtedly help to find a formula to get us out of this ."
"With regard to the second aspect, relating to collective management companies, the fear may be that a Commission proposal, for example, taking the radical approach of the Bolkestein Directive of total liberalisation, could end up removing any possibility of effective protection of intellectual property rights."
"At the moment, we have a series of national systems for protecting intellectual property and a simple liberalisation could lead to authors losing their protection, in other words, replacing the system consisting of a series of national markets relatively well protected by their national management bodies, with a system in which there is no type of protection, could put authors, designers and inventors in a difficult situation."
"I would simply like, therefore, to call on the Commission, when drawing up this proposal, not to make the same mistake as the Bolkestein proposal, which, as we know, has today even been one of the elements used to argue against the approval of the European Constitution in the referenda, but rather to seek a system that links the need for harmonisation in this field with the protection of a basic service, the protection of intellectual property and of artistic and literary creation."
". – Mr President, without doubt, the debate on the Community patent is of no small significance in terms of the European economy."
"In any case, there is one effect which must not be underestimated: as long as patents continue to be as expensive as they are now, much of their protective function is lost; patents can even block rather than foster innovation."
"However, when we see, from the other side, that the need for diversity and the fostering of diversity are entrenched both in decision-making processes and in the minds of Europeans, then it will be hard for us to simply leap this hurdle."
"I therefore think that we here in Parliament must pay special attention first and foremost to the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are inseparable from the competitiveness that we urgently need to support, and on which subject, Commissioner, I have heard little from you."
"At present the situation is untenable."
"Naturally, this also applies to the question of copyright."
"I would point out here that the approach so far, compared with intellectual property rights, is no longer adequate, especially in the field of art – the performing arts, music, and so on – on the Internet and in view of all the changes here."
"People are saying that we cannot make criminals out of a whole generation who simply download whatever they can from the Internet with no sense of wrongdoing."
"Besides, it is our duty to make a strict distinction between this and software patenting, because the blurred relationship between the European Patent Convention and national case law has created a problematic situation, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
". – Mr President, we must, of course attach great importance to the issue of the Community patent and related legislation, so as to ensure that we do not undermine innovation and that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not adversely affected."
"We feel it is wrong to create a Community patent at any cost, as this indeed undermines the interests of small and medium-sized countries, with regard to both the language arrangements and the role of the national institutions and national patent agencies."
"This is, of course, quite apart from our concerns as regards any case of patents affecting key areas such as life, natural heritage, software and medicines, and which often only serve the interests of the multinationals. As for the language arrangements, as mentioned in this House, we do not feel it is right to provide for the use of only a limited number of languages."
"This goes against the principle of non-discrimination between companies and creates a genuine directory of main languages. Accordingly, a precedent is set and the use of all of the official languages is put at risk."
"We therefore feel that the best way of defending micro-enterprises and SMEs in all Member States is to uphold the principle of non-discrimination between countries and companies and, especially, in terms of the language arrangements."
"That concludes this item."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0112/2005) by Mrs Fraga Estévez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93 and (EC) No 973/2001 [COM(2003)0589 – C5-0480/2003 – 2003/0229(CNS)]."
". Mr President, let me express the Commission's any my personal satisfaction with the method and the quality of the work done to tackle the challenge of developing adequate management measures for our Mediterranean fisheries."
"It could not be taken for granted that the deadlock on this matter during the term of the previous European Parliament could be overcome."
"The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise."
"Members of the European Parliament have shown their ability to listen to the spectrum of views that have been voiced on this important question."
"Parliament's opinion, which I hope will be adopted today, is a good starting point for the work to be carried out in the Council and I hope that the European institutions will be able to deliver the new regulation shortly, in the interests of our fishermen and of fisheries and the marine environment of the Mediterranean."
"The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal."
"I am happy to be able to inform you that we can accept 22 of the 34 amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries and other Members."
"Nine amendments of the 22 accepted, and in particular Amendments 2, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26 were part of a compromise package agreed with the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Fisheries."
"The compromise is not perfect in all details."
"Nonetheless a delicate balance of quite different views has been achieved without compromising the effectiveness of the proposal."
"Let me turn to the other amendments tabled to the report before us."
"The Commission can also accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 24, which introduce new elements that either reinforce our proposal or make the timing of the introduction of certain measures more gradual."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 1, 3, 4, 19, and 27 to 34."
"In particular, the concept of responsibility of nationals of Member States is already enshrined in the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy and should be maintained here."
"Amendments 1, 3 and 4 cannot therefore be accepted."
"With respect to Amendments 19 and 33, which ask for the insertion of provisions for financial support for temporary fishing bans and for fishermen affected by the prohibition of certain fishing gear, the Commission believes that these proposals are not appropriate here, either because there are already rules on these matters under Community legislation and/or because these issues are to be dealt with in the framework of the European fisheries fund proposal."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 27, which could dilute the significance of setting a minimum landing size for the species covered by the proposed regulation."
"In the absence of a minimum size, there would not be any incentive for fishermen to avoid the areas of aggregation of juveniles or undersized organisms or to improve selectivity as regards fishing gear and practices."
"Moreover, the common market for fisheries products calls for a harmonised minimum size."
"A strict correspondence between minimum size and selectivity of prescribed equipment is rarely possible, particularly in multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, as is the case in the Mediterranean."
"Moreover, some minimum landing sizes are set for species caught, mainly with fishing gear and practices that are not regulated in this proposal and where selectivity is essentially left to the fishermen themselves."
"As far as Amendment 28 is concerned, the same is not clear."
"The deletion of paragraph 3 would mean that whitebait fisheries would be completely forbidden."
"The Commission's aim is instead to keep them within a clear regulatory framework of national management plans."
"The Commission cannot therefore accept this proposal."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 29, because a 30% increase in the height of the nets would increase fishing effort for small pelagic species, against scientific advice that calls for no increase in the fishing effort targeting this resource."
"Moreover, since purse seines may be used to catch demersal species in coastal areas, we should avoid authorising large purse seines that could touch the bottom in coastal areas where protected habitats, such as Posidonia beds, occur."
"The Commission is however open to regulating this type of fishing gear by differentiating between purse seine fisheries for small pelagic species, demersal species and tuna."
"Each category should follow different rules."
"I hope that further refinement will be possible within the Council."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 30 and 31."
"It is widely recognised that management of fishing effort should be one of the main management tools in the Mediterranean."
"Establishing the maximum overall dimensions for certain small-scale fishing gear is a way to address this."
"The huge number of fishermen using this gear makes it indispensable to set maximum dimensions to avoid further increases in size which would result in insuperable walls of nets that impede free movement and migration for several species."
"Small-scale fishermen should also contribute to conservation."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 32 and 34 for different reasons."
"The list of species in Annex VIII to Council Regulation 1039/98 requested by Amendment 32 contains species which are either not present in the Mediterranean or which can be caught by bottom-set nets and anchored floating nets in coastal areas."
"It is therefore undesirable to include the full list of species here."
"In fact the rationale of Article 7(2) as mentioned in Amendment 10 is to list a group of species which are caught offshore in midwater, or close to the surface of very deep waters and which, when they occur in the catch of a bottom-set gillnet or entangling net, are clear signals that such a net is a drift net rather than a bottom-set net."
"This provision is the only way to enforce the large pelagic drift net ban."
"Nonetheless, the Commission is open to a large list of species if there is evidence that certain species cannot be caught by real bottom-set nets but only by drift nets."
"Amendment 34 suggesting a derogation for vessels smaller than 18 metres would gravely weaken the enforcement of the large pelagic drift nets ban."
"This amendment is based on the assumption that Article 7(2) addresses a type of surface gillnet targeting tuna. This assumption is not correct, since such nets cannot be classified as an anchored floating net or bottom-set net as defined in Article 2(9) and (12) respectively."
"In conclusion, may I express the confidence that, with the help of the European Parliament, we can put before the Council an improved Commission proposal, which should facilitate its position vis-à-vis the Council."
"All Mediterranean fishermen and the marine ecosystems that they exploit need urgent and effective fisheries management."
"The adoption of a new, more effective and specially tailored European Union conservation policy for Mediterranean fisheries will also foster more ambitious steps within the multilateral framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean."
"As you are well aware, fishing effort has been increasing in many areas and the exploitation pattern is still not satisfactory."
"In order to guide Mediterranean fisheries towards sustainable exploitation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, the European Union, which is the biggest fishing power in the region, needs to set a good and credible example."
"A more effective Community management framework is needed to recover the full production and productivity potential of the Mediterranean in the interests first of all of our fishermen and also of other European citizens that want to benefit from the richness of the Mediterranean."
"In concluding my speech, may I once again thank the rapporteur, as well as the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their excellent cooperation on this matter."
"Their proactive cooperation has indeed provided us with a substantial input that will help ensure sustainability for fisheries in the Mediterranean."
". – Mr President, through this report, for which it has been my pleasure to be rapporteur, we finally have the opportunity to produce a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean, eleven years after the first attempt to impose order by means of the technical measures regulation, Regulation No 1696/94."
"This is therefore a crucial moment for the fisheries sector in the area, and for having made it possible for us to reach this moment, I must fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Joe Borg and Director-General Jörgen Holmquist — who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward — their services, with whom I have worked on a daily basis, and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have been wise and generous enough to give up many of their local sectors’ demands, sometimes despite strong pressure, in order not to deprive the whole Mediterranean sector of common management rules."
"With everybody’s involvement, we have been able to unblock the Commission’s initial proposal which, perhaps because it was drawn up too quickly, had opened up apparently insoluble conflicts with the national administrations, with the sector and with this Parliament, which, as you will remember, rejected the proposal by means of the report by Mr Lisi."
"In order to get out of this , I proposed to the Commission that we work in unison on a common text on the points on which there was the greatest controversy, with a view to achieving a joint compromise acceptable to Parliament and the Commission which we would then present once again to the Council of Ministers."
"The Commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a year’s work, this is what we are presenting to the House today for its approval."
"It may not be as ambitious a text as many of us would have liked; perhaps no one got everything they wanted."
"But we have all lost a little so that we may all emerge winners, because, if there was one thing we all agreed upon, it was that the situation of fishing in the Mediterranean could not remain at the mercy of a minimal regulation, which complicated more than it resolved."
"If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply."
"This working method has also allowed us to avoid leaps into the dark with no scientific or logical basis, and certain contradictions in the initial text which led to the outright rejection of the proposal."
"For example, we introduce rationality and consistency into the regulation of the depths and distances from the coast within which it is possible to fish in such a biologically-, economically- and socially-sensitive sea."
"For the first time, dredges are regulated, the way is opened for the use of more selective meshes — such as square mesh for towed nets — and considerable progress is made on bringing mesh size into line with the minimum sizes of species."
"Furthermore, with regard to the Commission’s maximal initiative on bans, minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of highly migratory species, it has been agreed firstly to attempt to get the regional fisheries organisations, such as the GFCM and the ICCAT, to produce these regulations, since this fishing is also carried out in the Mediterranean by third-country fleets and it does not make sense to impose restrictions solely on Community vessels."
"Nevertheless, if within a period of one year, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities, stemming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds."
"With regard to the content of the report, I would finally like to stress the effort to provide greater protection for species by means of minimum sizes, with the only temporary exception of hake, where we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal to lower the size to 15 cm — which we have maintained until 2007, when the traditional size of 20 cm will return, coinciding with the proposed increase in mesh."
"Furthermore, for the first time, the size of sardine is regulated, sizes that had disappeared from the Commission’s proposal are recovered, such as the size of clam or striped venus, and reasonable increases in size are introduced for other species, since the ultimate objective is to move closer to the scientific recommendations in the Mediterranean as well."
"Mr President, having once again called upon this House to approve this report and, in particular, the compromise reached with the Commission, I shall end by expressing my hope that the Council will fully accept this new proposal, which is the result of this compromise between the European Commission and the European Parliament."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estévez’s excellent report in terms of its content and how it draws the strands together, describes the specific character of the Mediterranean more effectively than the Council’s proposal."
"Such a specific character means that, although the objectives of the Community’s management of fisheries must be the same throughout the EU, the means for achieving them must be adapted to the specific features of fishing in the Mediterranean."
"Doing so would take account both of the various biological, geographical and legal circumstances of the region, and of the aim of utilising the experience and skills of fishermen’s organisations operating in the Mediterranean."
"One specific feature is small-scale coastal fishing."
"The majority of fishing vessels in the Italian fleet is less than 12 metres long and therefore we cannot disregard the difficulties that will be faced in converting them for other kinds of fishing – something that is greatly desired by the Community."
"Small-scale coastal fishing must not only be defined but also safeguarded, and, in the case of reconversion, higher levels of compensation and incentives must be dedicated to it, in order to avoid creating serious socioeconomic problems for the sector as a whole."
"The proposal also specifies the role of the Regional Advisory Council, a body expressly created to promote the direct involvement of fishermen, and the vehicle for bringing first-hand experiences to the decision-making process, in order that Community legislation is increasingly in line with reality and the problems of the fisheries sector."
"We greatly welcome the role of the regulation for the Mediterranean in introducing common rules, but for this very reason all the non-European countries bordering the Mediterranean need to adapt their legislation to the stock conservation policy."
"To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the position of the European Community at the heart of the large organisations regulating fishing, in order to make the main international forums such as GFCM andICCATmore aware of Europe’s fishing tradition."
"Finally, Mr President, I would also like to draw attention to the centrality of research, inasmuch as the basis of any good policy consists of the quality and depth of knowledge of the factors in play."
"From this perspective, the specific character of the Mediterranean has always been a problem: over and above the quantity of research, the problem lies in the discrepancy between research and the specific knowledge requirements of an effective management policy."
"That is why we need to insist in future on the coordination of scientific research and its applicability to the action plan."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must first of all thank Mrs Fraga Estévez for the excellent work she has carried out, and also the Commission for the sensitivity shown in taking account of what happened in the last parliamentary term, when Parliament had maintained that the Commission’s proposal could not be amended."
"Respect and a degree of humility on both sides have enabled a compromise to be reached."
"It has been possible to reopen a debate with the fishing organisations."
"We have succeeded in preventing the Mediterranean from becoming marginalised in comparison with other seas, subject to a host of obligations and bans, amounting merely to a policy designed to penalise."
"Whilst appreciating the fact that the regulation represents a step forward and useful mediation, however, we believe that, even now, it retains an approach that is still linked – albeit to a lesser degree - to a model of fishing suited to the northern seas."
"The northern seas are characterised by highly industrialised and single-species fishing, and they have a completely different marine biology to that of the Mediterranean."
"That is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you, Commissioner – on various minimum sizes, which we would have liked to fix more decisively: sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean."
"Equally, it is difficult to dictate overly specific limits on fishing gear, since an artisanal activity, carried out by small fleets, varies from country to country partly according to the kinds and variety of traditions."
"With the implementation of this regulation, we would like to aim at an objective that is rarely achieved: a basin-wide policy, that is, a global approach."
"That of course involves paying attention to the management and conservation of fishery resources, to anti-pollution efforts and also to the safeguarding of jobs."
"I would like to point out, Commissioner, that 80% of the fishing carried out in the Mediterranean is small scale and takes place in regions that are mainly located within the area of the former Objective 1: areas experiencing extreme social hardship, high rates of unemployment, and, in many cases, deprived of social support."
"I believe that particular sensitivity towards maintaining employment levels is a joint mission for the Commission and Parliament."
"We call on the Council to accept this proposal and to take into due consideration the quantity and quality of the work that it has made possible."
". – Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, on her hard work on this legislation."
"I wish to make some general comments."
"Fish, as everybody knows, is an important source of healthy human nutrition and is, quite rightly, much sought after by the consumer."
"It is also a major source of income for thousands of fishermen and other people involved in the fishing trade, including many small, medium and large businesses."
"The seas provide this fish, but uncontrolled fishing practices will eventually diminish supply and kill off the fishing industry."
"It is thus imperative that measures to manage the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are legislated for and implemented as soon as possible."
"This is especially so with respect to the Mediterranean Sea, where stocks of many fish species appear in many instances to be at threshold levels."
"That is why this legislation is so urgently needed."
"However, legislation becomes significant not when it is approved on paper, but when it is implemented in practice."
"This is a major weakness, especially with respect to fishing."
"Observation, surveillance and action to ensure application of the rules is unfortunately inadequate in many, if not in most, cases."
"Out there on the high seas, things are not as they should be."
"Gross violations are committed daily by those who bend the rules or just disregard them altogether."
"So the first point to be made is that much needs to be done to verify implementation of the legislation."
"The second point concerns the scientific data available to us."
"This information is essential if we are to understand and properly assess, for example, fishing stocks, breeding grounds, migration patterns and catchment methods."
"Are our present scientific data reliable?"
"Unfortunately, it would appear not."
"It is thus of the utmost importance to direct efforts at getting accurate fishing data, free not only from scientific error but also from external manipulation aimed at boosting personal profits rather than fish conservation."
"Last but not least, I refer to the diminishing species of the small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises of the smaller Mediterranean Member States like my country, Cyprus."
"Already disadvantaged by being a small island at the periphery of the EU, half occupied by Turkish and British troops, Cyprus is now facing the very real threat of having its fishing industry completely destroyed."
"A few hundred fishermen who have been carrying on the centuries-old family tradition of fishing around their island are now facing annihilation by the bureaucratic and, it seems, heartless dragon of Brussels, acting in conjunction with faceless international commissions whose main concern is to satisfy the interests of the big multinational companies and powerful governments."
"So vessels from all over the world fish freely around Cyprus, but the Cypriot fishermen cannot do so because they are being strangulated by ridiculously low quotas."
"Take tuna, for example."
"The EU has a quota allocation of about 18 000 tonnes per year and the Commission in its wisdom has, for some years, considered giving Cyprus a quota of just 5 to 10 tonnes, instead of the 500 to 1 000 tonnes needed."
"The Commission blames many factors, such as previous years undeclared or erroneous catchment statistics by the Cyprus authorities, but these are just excuses."
"The fishermen of Cyprus …"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted that we were able to adopt this compromise."
"I wished to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez, who has accomplished a difficult and delicate, but nonetheless urgent, task in order to regulate and make provision for sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean, a sea that is itself threatened by extremely problematic developments: various types of pollution, decreasing resources, and threats to biodiversity."
"I am delighted at this compromise for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, it sets out in a particularly clear manner which fishing gear is authorised or banned; it lays down the parameters for drift nets, mesh sizes, the minimum size of fish, deep-sea trawling and so on."
"Equally, it ensures that European policy with regard to other seas of relevance to us, whether in the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea, is coherent."
"It was essential to equip ourselves with tools and policies for managing the fishery resources in the Mediterranean."
"It is also a fair compromise, allowing the majority of the countries concerned to find an effective balance between what one set of countries or another has had to accept or refuse in order to reach this compromise."
"There remain, however, a number of issues to resolve which have in fact been raised by the previous speakers."
"One is the management of the entire Mediterranean basin, since we are only talking about the Member States of the European Union in this compromise."
"It is advisable, in fact, to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish, within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin."
"Further problems relate to bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species, or types of fishing such as purse-seine fishing, carried out for the purposes of aquaculture and involving practices that present an increasing number of problems."
"This compromise regulation does not directly target that type of fishing, but it is understandable how artisanal fishermen who feel themselves targeted by this regulation find it unfair that no further regulation is imposed on a developing method of fishing that creates huge problems for the preservation of ecosystems, given the means by which it is carried out."
"Finally, I will repeat what Members have said regarding the need for the European Union urgently to conduct a much more active research policy on the Mediterranean."
"However, we do not have a large amount of the information and data which would enable us to fine-tune these policies and these tools."
"Equally, I believe that monitoring and implementing them depend on the political will of the Member States to enforce this new regulation."
"That is what the debate hinges upon."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not accept the proposal on the exploitation of Mediterranean fishery resources because it is unscientific."
"It tries to focus solely on taking measures to ban the use of fishing gear throughout the Mediterranean, whereas it is common knowledge that the burden on this sea's ecosystem is an extremely acute problem of marine pollution, as the result both of the careless use of pesticides and industrial pollution in general."
"We know full well that the composition and fishing potential in the Mediterranean are different, due to the different conditions which prevail and interact, resulting in different degrees of eutrophication and, consequently, of sizes of catch."
"That is why we emphasise that the levelling down approach taken in the proposal, which generalises reductions in their output, will have different consequences from one fisherman to another."
"When the above generalised bans are applied, they will have tragic consequences for certain areas."
"That is because, on the pretext of protecting fish stocks, the proposal reduces the fishing capacity, resulting in the immediate reduction and disappearance of income from fisheries for small and medium-sized fishing operations and, ultimately, a mass exodus from this occupation."
"The result of all the above measures being proposed will be the mass destruction of fishing communities and the abandonment of entire geographical areas, while aquaculture will hasten to cover the fishery deficit which is expected to be created and its interests will be strengthened for the benefit of large monopolies operating in this sector."
"Thus, the role of capital in fisheries will become stronger and its previous social and other historic characteristics will disappear."
"The monopolisation of fisheries will be reinforced, as will the profits of business groups, to the detriment of small and medium-sized fishing operations, the workers and the grass-roots classes, with painful consequences for the marine ecosystem and the environment in general."
"We believe that the policy of managing fishing capacity and the development of fisheries cannot be comprehended separately from the interests of small and medium-sized fishing operations."
"We consider that the development of fisheries must, at the same time, respect the ecosystem and the potential of each area, as well as the broader interests of the local society and economy, far from and contrary to the ambitions and interests of big business."
"All this must be incorporated into a more global plan which, using cooperatives of fishery producers as a lever, will make the most productive use of individual fishery potential."
"Within this framework, appropriate technical measures can be assessed and imposed which will be scientifically substantiated and will be considered necessary in order to maintain fish stocks, safeguard the productive potential of each area ..."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concern for preserving the fishery resources in the Mediterranean is completely legitimate."
"It is indeed necessary to preserve a rich and diverse environment and essential food resources for future generations."
"Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential."
"Of all the living creatures populating this planet, there is, however, one that has not only duties but also rights."
"I am referring to human beings."
"The regulation submitted to us presents a compromise, the intention of which I certainly understand: it is a compromise not only between the different sovereign nations that make up Europe, but also between the ways in which the environment is used and conserved."
"However, Amendment 10, tabled by our rapporteur, directly affects a Mediterranean fishing activity that is traditional to France, the ."
"This is an ancient fishing technique, specific to the French Mediterranean, in which bluefin tuna are caught using an anchored surface net."
"My fellow Members, be aware that, by approving this amendment, you will be signing the death warrant of 1 200 jobs directly and indirectly linked to this activity."
"On the ground, there is incomprehension, as well as legitimate anger."
"For years, fishermen in this sector have made significant efforts, particularly with regard to protecting cetaceans, in order to limit the impact of their activity on the ecosystem."
"Their accidental catches are now only residual."
"Scientific studies show that this method of fishing is one that respects its environment."
"I know that this compromise has been difficult to reach, but I appeal to the Commission, the Council and especially the French Government."
"What are a few extra days of negotiation compared with the distress of 300 families and an entire region?"
"What weight will the argument regarding the compromise package carry, and that of Pandora’s box, which should certainly not be opened in France, where public opinion is increasingly aware that Brussels is out of touch with the reality of people’s lives?"
"Let us not forget that 80% of fishing in the Mediterranean is of an artisanal nature, so why should we always favour the remaining 20%?"
"Mrs Fraga Estévez, Members, reopen the negotiations in order to save these jobs!"
"Commissioner Borg has just informed us that he refuses to approve our Amendment 34, on the grounds that Article 7(2), on which our amendment is founded, is based on a classification that does not correspond to the text."
"In my opinion, that is a matter of legal quibbling that concerns the detail of what the Commissioner and his services must regulate, but does not take account of the basis of the amendment, namely the protection of fishermen’s rights, which the amendment must crucially ensure is respected."
"With this in mind, I call on you to vote against Amendment 10 tabled by our rapporteur, whom I nevertheless congratulate on the tireless work that she has carried out, and I call on you to vote in favour of our Amendment 34."
"On behalf of the fishermen whom you will save, I thank you."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after long and arduous negotiations, begun not much less than two years ago, we have reached a compromise that only partially satisfies our Group. We are delighted, for example, to see resurrected potential financial support for the biological standstill, even if the new European Fisheries Fund is not considering it."
"Important matters remain on the table, however, which, in our opinion, are at odds with the interests of fishing in the Mediterranean."
"A further example: we believe that, given the importance of the whitebait sector, that species can be put on sale on condition that it is caught with statutory gear."
"That is why we have tabled Amendment 27, which we hope will be adopted."
"We have stressed the specific character of Mediterranean fishing a number of times: it is essentially coastal and small scale, a type of fishing that is part of culture and which, in addition to passing down a centuries-old tradition from generation to generation, constitutes a vital source for the economy, particularly in an area – let us not forget – of extensive socioeconomic degradation."
"We therefore believe that points 3 and 4 of Annex 2 must be taken out, the intention of which is to regulate and standardise the technical features of small-scale gear, which, precisely because it is linked to a specific type of fishing and to specific coastal zones, cannot by its very nature be the subject of regulatory enforcement."
"We congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna, but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen, who, up to now, have only been required to observe bans and limits, whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fishing is nothing short of essential for the survival of the human race: more than one billion people live on animal protein or its by-products."
"As regards catch potential, according to the experts, we are reaching the limit and it is therefore right that the European Parliament and the Commission are attempting to put a limit on fishing, to manage catches in a sustainable way and to stamp out destructive forms of fishing."
"Fishing and aquaculture, however, represent one of the principal activities of the Union."
"The European fisheries market is ranked third in the world after China and Peru."
"In France, Greece, Italy and Spain approximately 100 000 fishermen and tens of thousands of fishing vessels are involved in the fisheries sector."
"The European fleet – which is an artisanal fleet, as the statistical data show – consists primarily of vessels lighter than 10 tonnes. The essentially artisanal character of our fleet and our fishermen is therefore obvious."
"Citizens thus expect the European Parliament and the Commission to strike a balanced position, reconciling economic and ecological needs."
"Similarly, the protection of fish stocks must be more strictly based on scientific information than is the case at present, but we must also actively involve fishermen in the management of fishery resources and liaise with the environmental world in order to raise awareness and call attention to employment issues."
"We therefore call for the gradual application of the new regulations."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez’s report, on the whole, puts ..."
"– Mr President, I would like to say firstly that the work carried out by the rapporteur –– in this case, Mrs Fraga –– and by the Members of the Committee on Fisheries, is above all an example of cooperation, as the Commissioner pointed out, and it sends a very positive signal in terms of the future co-existence of the two institutions."
"I am convinced that this can only increase the credibility of this common policy within the European fisheries sector."
"The cooperation –– which, as I have said, was close and effective –– between the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga –– who has done a magnificent job –– and the Commission services, has allowed us to come to this House today with a compromise acceptable to the majority of Parliament, and with a clear message to the sector, which under no circumstances must we break or spoil."
"The most important thing is that this cooperation should allow us to unblock a situation which had become unsustainable; unsustainable for the Community institutions, of course, but above all for a sea whose resources have been regarded as over-exploited for some time, but which, owing to its special characteristics, has remained in a permanent state of exception, and it is now time to put an end to that."
"The Mediterranean is a different kind of sea: national waters are more limited than in other areas of the Community, fish populations transcend areas and are shared, the general characteristics of the activity are different — there is above all a small-scale fishing fleet and a high proportion of fishermen fish on a part-time basis — there are many small landing sites, etc."
"In addition, therefore, to the structural and market measures defined in the CFP that are already being applied, the conservation policy must be implemented in the Mediterranean in a similar fashion, as well as the regulations –– which must be improved and developed –– the harmonisation of minimum sizes and technical measures –– which must be absolute throughout the European Union and effective throughout the Mediterranean Basin –– and effective control — which must resolve a problem; the sale in a Member State, which is all too frequently Spain, of illegal fish originating from another Member State, because that illegal fishing damages both parties: the State that is selling it, because it damages resources, and the State that is receiving it, because it damages prices and, above all, damages the faith of the fishermen in the management mechanisms."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my hope that we will all benefit from the vote."
"– Mr President, I question whether the EU really is interested in achieving the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources."
"It is a contradiction that this is what the EU recommends in the report, at the same time as having fisheries agreements with countries in, for example, Africa."
"These third-country agreements contribute to overfishing of the oceans and impair many developing countries’ ability to build up profitable fishing industries themselves."
"A recently published report by the Swedish National Board of Fisheries criticises the EU’s third-country agreements."
"The criticism is based on the fact that none of these agreements promotes sustainable fishing and that they are also implemented in a way that does not comply with the FAO’s code of conduct."
"A number of non-governmental organisations share that view and have pointed out that the agreements predominantly affect coastal communities badly."
"If the sustainable development of fishery resources really is a priority issue for the EU, the latter must not only advocate measures in the Mediterranean, as in this report, but also recommend and implement a radical review of its fisheries agreements with third countries."
"In this report, Parliament has altered the Commission’s proposal, which does not promote sustainable development, in favour of the fishing industry."
"The EU should not work on issues concerning fishing."
"Issues of this type should be dealt with at regional and sub-regional levels insofar as that is possible."
"Those issues concerning fishing that presuppose international cooperation may usefully be dealt with within the framework of international bodies in which national special interests are not as marked as is the case in the EU."
". Mr President, I would like to underscore once again my satisfaction at the manner in which Parliament has cooperated on this important dossier."
"Our shared objective is to achieve sustainability of fisheries in the Mediterranean."
"We owe this to our fishermen and also to the maintenance of a sustainable marine ecosystem to be able to support this activity."
"Through a constructive dialogue, we have explored the avenues to finding some technical solutions to what before seemed to be intractable difficulties."
"I would like to underline that the aim of the proposal is to create a conservation plan for the Mediterranean."
"We achieved this through finding a balance and we have instituted measures to protect small-scale fisheries in particular."
"For example, fishing for bianchetto continues to be allowed in our proposal, but with selective gear, not with trawls."
"With the advent of the new Parliament and when I took office, I had to decide what to do regarding the Mediterranean proposal."
"It was decided at that time that rather than withdrawing the original proposal, we would leave it on the table, but adopt a flexible approach."
"That is exactly what we did and, to this effect, we have worked very closely with the Fisheries Committee."
"We have taken on board the amendments proposed by the Fisheries Committee as a package."
"We have also taken on board a number of other amendments from individual MEPs."
"Consultations have been carried out in an extensive manner with representatives of the sector for the Mediterranean, both by the Fisheries Committee and by the Commission."
"We are discussing with the Member States with a view to having the proposal adopted as early as the June Council."
"We are making significant progress and we can accept certain other amendments to sensitise the regulation even further to the specificities of Mediterranean fisheries, but without forgoing the fundamental principle of sustainability."
"We, the Community, have a responsibility to set a credible and strong example."
"We will continue to work with our partners in the Mediterranean Sea to convince them of the need to adopt measures along the same lines as ours."
"We have set up the Medisamac as a forum, bringing together most Mediterranean littoral States."
"We have strengthened the GFCM to be able to use it as a tool to achieve common standards, and we are working to establish a regional advisory council for the Mediterranean, which will work further in this direction."
"The Community has to set an example."
"It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean."
"Once the regulation is adopted, we will work within the GFCM and with individual third countries through our very good relations with them on all fronts, based now on partnership and neighbourhood, to adopt measures on the same lines as these and to have a level playing field for the Mediterranean."
"In conclusion, my appreciation goes to all of you, and in particular the rapporteur, for her tireless work."
"You have come up with a proposal that I will clearly defend in the forthcoming discussions in the Council."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"– Mr President, I feel you have been unduly strict with us today."
"I know this is Thursday but, as the secretariat will confirm, there is plenty of time left over from our groups' speaking time."
"My group had nine minutes and I used only four."
"Your comment that people have planes to catch is not applicable, because we have to be here until this afternoon."
"There is voting at 5.30 p.m. and if some MEPs want to go home early ..."
"No, Mr Matsakis, I am not giving you the floor for that."
"I am here to make sure that the speaking times, which have been very rigorously scheduled, are adhered to."
"You are well aware of how things work."
"I have experience of what happens on Thursdays at 1 p.m., when people come and say to the Presidency that so and so’s speaking time has not been adhered to. The speaking times are not scheduled just for the sake of it."
"This is the European Parliament, and the speaking times are not unlimited."
"The next item is the report (A6-0157/2005) by Mr Freitas, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme [COM(2004)0764 - C6-0245/2004 - 2004/0268(CNS)]."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Freitas for this report, as well as for his interest, participation and input in the Committee on Fisheries."
"I would also like to thank the President and the members of the committee for its expeditious examination of this proposed regulation."
"This will enable the European Community to pass a clear signal to the AIDCP at its Annual Meeting beginning on 13 June 2005, that with the adoption by Parliament of this proposal from the Commission, the European Community is well on the road to completing the necessary internal procedures to becoming a full member of this organisation."
"I am pleased to accept a number of amendments suggested by Mr Freitas, notably Amendments 2, 3, 5 and 6."
"In particular, these amendments will increase the transparency and simplify the understanding of the content and reasoning behind the need for this Council decision, which will enable the Community to fulfil its international obligations to become a party to regional fisheries organisations where they exist and to defend Community interests in the global fisheries."
"This will also enable the Community to be at the forefront of these organisations and enhance the leading role that it has constantly played in the operation of regional fisheries organisations."
"I am not, however, in a position to accept the remaining proposed amendments, with the exception of Amendment 4, which I can accept provided that the phrase ‘and its certification scheme’ is deleted."
"I will comment on the certification scheme later with respect to other amendments."
"I find difficulty in accepting the other amendments for the following reasons. This proposal relates to the approval of AIDCP, whereas Amendments 1, 9, and 11 focus heavily on a secondary issue of the AIDCP, namely, the tuna tracking and verification system, which is already EC law."
"Amendment 10 requires that future changes to the tuna tracking and verification system regulation follow a certain process, in contradiction to the appropriate comitology provisions within the regulation."
"This regulation is already in force and changes can be made to it as and when necessary."
"Amendments 7, 8, and 12 relate to the issue of AIDCP certification and consumer information."
"Again, such amendments are not helpful in this instance since the issue of whether the Community accepts AIDCP certification is still being considered by the Member States and, pending such a consultation, the Commission has not adopted any fixed position."
"The inclusion of any reference to certification is premature and could prejudice the internal debate that still has to be concluded."
"Furthermore, the issue of certification is not one of the objectives of the AIDCP, nor is it included in the general measures of the AIDCP Agreement, nor in the application of the AIDCP Programme itself."
"This is a secondary commercial economic interest that is a consequence of the implementation of part of the AIDCP, and not a core element."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have suggested a balance that I believe can be struck between the conservation of eco-systems and the social and economic interests of the fisheries sector. Although such a balance will be difficult, it is often an attainable target, as evidenced by this compromise."
"As rapporteur of this proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme, I was delighted to see that it is possible to coordinate strategies that can meet the interests of fishermen and of all of those involved, while ensuring that eco-systems can be preserved."
"The programme on which this Agreement is based, and which the Community intends to conclude, has three key priorities: firstly, to monitor the abundance of dolphins and levels of dolphin mortality linked to tuna fishing in the area covered by the Agreement; secondly, to study the causes of dolphin mortality during fishing operations, whilst at the same time promoting fishing techniques and gear capable of minimising these effects; and thirdly, to study the impact of various fishing models on various species of fish and other creatures in the pelagic ecosystem."
"In order to accomplish the objectives, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), which is coordinating this programme, is proposing to put in place a range of measures, among which I should like to highlight the implementation of sustainable fishing quotas for tuna caught in the Agreement area and the presence of on-board observers during each fishing trip."
"As they are aware of the importance of conserving fishing stocks, the vessel owners and fishermen have developed fishing techniques that are less harmful to the target species and to the by-catch concerned."
"It is important to emphasise that the efforts led to a reduction in the by-catch of dolphins in the Agreement area as a result of purse-seine fishing from around 150 000 in 1989 to 1 500 in 2002."
"As well as playing an important part in preserving dolphin communities in this region, this Agreement has also helped to preserve the ecosystem as a whole by preserving communities of other species in addition to dolphins, such as sharks, turtles and other aquatic animals often killed, thanks to the use of different fishing gear specially designed to catch these species of tuna."
"This demonstrates the high level of selectivity achieved thus far and goes to show the value of this programme that the Community is seeking to sign up to."
"In addition to the technical measures involved, the programme encompasses a ‘dolphin-safe’ certification scheme for products caught without any harm being done to dolphins. Let me stress the point that this certification can only be awarded to products where no dolphin – or other species not being fished – is harmed."
"The issue of certification has been extensively debated in the UN’s Committee on Fisheries and Food and Agriculture Association and in the European Commission, which, as I understand, is in the process of drawing up a communication on the issue of eco-labelling."
"This is a very important subject, which is worthy of debate, because in the case of tuna there are a number of non-governmental organisations that have, sometimes less than transparently, influenced the trade flow of processed tuna products in the EU."
"I therefore feel, Commissioner, that following discussion in the Committee on Fisheries, this was an important time to raise awareness among the Commission and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries of the fact that the European Union needs to regulate the issue of eco-labelling, and it was to an extent with this in mind that some amendments were tabled."
"I feel that there must be a public body in charge of this process, although private firms and non-governmental organisations can be partners prior or subsequent to this process."
"For the entire certification process to have the highest possible credibility, however, there must be a public body in charge."
"For these reasons, and in line with the guidelines of the common fisheries policy, I believe that this programme deserves a favourable opinion from Parliament with regard to the conclusion of this Agreement by the EU."
"I should also like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Fisheries, and I am grateful to the members of that Committee. I also wish to thank the scientists, the organisations, the Commission, of course, and non-governmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, which attended a mini-hearing that I had arranged."
"I feel that this mini-hearing helped to convey the importance of this programme and to show that it is possible to have Agreement between fishermen, scientists and politicians on such an important issue."
"It might also serve to show the EU’s future role, as I said, in a good light, as regards this Agreement, by safeguarding its content, and throughout the eco-labelling process in the EU."
". Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent work on this report."
"As we know, it concerns the 2 billion dollar tuna industry."
"We all eat tuna and we are all familiar with the wide range of dolphin-friendly labels that appear on tuna cans and jars."
"These labels have, until now, been unregulated, confusing and often misleading."
"This initiative seeks to change that."
"The Freitas report shows why the governments of 15 countries in Latin America and Central America have joined with the EU and the US to support the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (AIDCP)."
"The eastern Pacific fleet targets large, mature yellow-fin tuna that swim beneath schools of dolphins, sometimes 20 000 strong."
"If any dolphins are caught in the tuna nets, up to half a dozen hardy fishermen with diving equipment jump into the nets to herd the dolphins to one end, where they jump to safety over the cork lines."
"Only when the last dolphin has been freed is the net hauled on board."
"There is no by-catch of any kind associated with this method of tuna fishing."
"Trained government observers are on board every tuna boat; vessels are licensed only if they have no record of violations; skippers must be trained and qualified; and by utilising that exhaustive system, dolphin deaths in the eastern Pacific have been dramatically reduced from 350 000 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1 600 per year at present."
"Of an estimated population of over 10 million dolphins in the eastern Pacific alone, this is really insignificant."
"That is why Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund support this fishing method in preference to others where there is a large by-catch."
"EU support for the AIDCP label has posed a significant threat to some NGOs, which have hijacked the international tuna industry and become its de facto regulators."
"One Californian NGO, in particular, has become enormously rich by receiving a payment for every can of tuna carrying its dolphin-friendly label."
"The fishing method that this NGO supports may well be dolphin-friendly, but it causes the death of tens of thousands of sharks as well as leatherback turtles and even young, immature yellow-fin tuna, which are tossed dead back into the sea."
"It is outrageous that this organisation now holds the international tuna industry to ransom, threatening to blacklist on their website any supermarkets that refuse to sell cans of tuna carrying their dolphin-safe labels."
"Members of this House have even received hostile, threatening and aggressive e-mails from the organisation this week."
"Their days are now numbered."
"The AIDCP label received unanimous support in the Committee on Fisheries and I believe that it will be supported by the majority of Members of this House today."
". – Mr President, I support this report by Mr Freitas and think that the European Parliament should give a positive response to the report, the proposal for a Council decision and the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation programme known as the AIDCP."
"I think that dolphins would vote for it if they could!"
"The goal of the AIDCP is progressively to reduce incidental dolphin mortalities in the tuna purse seine fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean."
"The aim is to reach zero levels through the setting of annual limits and the long-term sustainability of tuna stock in the agreement area."
"I also welcome the fact that the WWF and Greenpeace are supporting and promoting the agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme because it is a legally binding instrument that consolidates the results of an effort of interested governments, the tuna industry and the environmental community that, in less than 20 years, has led to a dramatic reduction of the mortality of dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean."
"More than 100 000 dolphins were killed in 1986 but thanks to this scheme fewer than 1 500 were killed in 2004."
"The AIDCP has established two systems: the tuna tracking and verification system, and the dolphin-safe certification system."
"Many of us like to eat tuna and European consumers consume over 530 000 tonnes each year."
"Most consumers would like to know that the tuna we eat has not resulted in dolphin by-catch deaths."
"The accuracy of some supermarket dolphin-safe labels has been questioned and according to the WWF the AIDCP systems for tuna tracking and dolphin-safe certification together represent at present the only programme that can guarantee consumers that the tuna labelled as 'AIDCP dolphin-safe' has in fact been caught without killing or seriously injuring dolphins."
"These outstanding results are obtained mainly through a system of independent observers on board, which is the only system that guarantees the coverage of 100% of the fishing trips by large tuna purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a set of stringent technical and operative requirements."
"The new label which will be introduced in the EU now guarantees consumers that no dolphins have been killed."
"People's purchasing power has won the day."
"The international fishing community has now woken up to the fact that consumers will not accept unnecessary deaths or damage to our environment in the food and fisheries industries."
"I urge colleagues to support this report."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Freitas for his constructive work on a report that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support."
"Industrial tuna fishing threatens not only tuna fish stocks but also other species, of which the best known is the dolphin."
"The Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme came about because a very great many of our people wanted to prevent dolphins from dying as a result of bad fishing methods."
"Now that we are making sure that the agreement is implemented in our legislation, it is important for these objectives to be attained."
"As my fellow MEPs have described, the work has so far been quite successful."
"Amendments 9 and 11 – tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the committee, where they were supported – are important for ensuring that consumers are not taken in by labelling."
"A reference to Article 3 of the Regulation of 2003 is important for also informing everyone who fulfils the conditions about the correct labelling requirements and ensuring that no one can fecklessly take advantage of these. This is something to which Mr Stevenson referred."
"We cannot forgo mentioning that, for this is Parliament’s opportunity to express its will to you as you continue to negotiate."
"We must also evaluate the dolphin-safe methods, which can be improved so that they do not harm other species."
"Log sets kill sea turtles and many other species."
"I know that the AIDCP has embarked upon work to improve these methods."
"It is important for us constantly to monitor developments and use the best possible methods."
". – Mr President, as well as questioning the legitimacy of the EU entering into the International Dolphin Conservation Programme instead of individual States, I would also question whether the EU can be trusted to make the right judgment."
"Let us consider the facts."
"The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities."
"Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen, now, thanks to Brussels, struggling to survive, while Spanish fishermen, for example, seem able to flout the rules at will."
"Consider, too, the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP."
"Then there is the fact that one million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the North Sea every year."
"Not only is it hugely wasteful, it is also damaging the ecosystem."
"Evidence, indeed, of the law of unintended consequences."
"The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa, which allow European factory farming boats, not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins, to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish."
"So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland, destroying local wild animal stocks."
"These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege."
"It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists."
"Why, after all, should the EU listen to experts?"
"Vessels participating in this programme are allowed a dolphin mortality limit."
"Explosives and speedboats are commonly used to scare dolphins and the programme even allows the deliberate killing of these animals, with over 1 400 observed dead last year, according to the Earth Island Institute’s ‘Dolphin Safe’ programme."
"If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue, it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling."
"After all, we in Britain have made some good decisions."
"We stayed out of the euro zone, our Prime Minister has probably dealt a mortal blow to the proposed Constitution, but, instead of following good practice, the EU seeks to sign up to a questionable agreement, simply to attempt once more to justify its own dubious international status."
"It shows, yet again, that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to take my turn in congratulating Mr Freitas on his exceptional report on dolphin conservation."
"May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Fraga on her report on the Mediterranean."
"These are thorough reports which respond to the current situation, in order to ensure that we shall have seas with fish in them both now and in the future."
"May I also take this opportunity, while we are debating dolphins, to mention an incident which took place in my country."
"What happened is that, after a storm at sea at the end of May, a kilometre-long net was found abandoned in the northern Aegean, which had been tossed around by the storm for 10 days and which, when it was noticed, had already caught dozens of dolphins and dozens of rare cetaceans which are threatened with extinction."
"This was an ecological disaster which came to light and was discovered, because there are others which we know nothing about."
"I should like to point out that the area of the northern Aegean is a rare and important marine habitat, because the River Evros flows into it, the waters come from the Dardanelles and, within the framework of protection for all seas, we must also pay particular attention to the Aegean."
"This unfortunate incident proves yet again that the environment has no borders."
"Broken nets spread death and this should worry us."
"I should like to say that it is our duty to protect the environment and the report by our honourable friend moves in that direction, which is why we should all vote for it."
"Finally, I should like to express to everyone a view which should prevail among us."
"It is our duty to protect the marine environment."
"Our children have a right to be able to fish in it also."
"We have an obligation to leave fish in our seas for future generations."
"– Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Freitas, who has done an excellent job, as we have recognised –– no amendments have been presented –– and also my colleague, Mrs Stihler, who, representing the Socialist Group, has done an excellent job as shadow rapporteur."
"Nevertheless, I would like to express a few humble opinions that may be a little discordant but which I believe may add some things that have not been said."
"Firstly, the main reason for the European Community to be involved in the IATCC and the AIPCD stems from the presence of the European or, if you like, the Spanish, tuna fleet in the Eastern Pacific, where it has been fishing since 1975."
"I say this because, in the explanatory statement in Mr Freitas’s report, the justification appears to be based on other reasons and not on the presence of our fleet in the Eastern Pacific."
"Our fleet fishes in the Eastern Pacific and it has, of course, never fished with dolphins, because a Community Regulation prohibits it: Council Regulation No 850/98 of 30 March 1998, Article 33."
"Since I believe it may be useful to this House, I would like to say that the AIPCD has been created as a result of a specific problem involving the United States fleet, and subsequently the Mexican fleet, the Venezuelan fleet and the Colombian fleet, the only ones which, together with El Salvador, currently fish with dolphins."
"I believe that this is something that we, as Europeans, can be pleased about."
"We, who have been fishing in that area –– as I have said –– since 1975, participate in the AIPCD despite the fact that our activities have nothing to do with the true objective of this agreement, because we do not fish with dolphins."
"The EU signed this Agreement, the AIPCD, on 26 April 1999, it communicated that decision to the trustee of the AIPCD, the United States of America, by means of a verbal note on 8 June 1999, and at that time, the Council considered that signature and that provisional application to be the first steps to its subsequent approval by the EC."
"Although, for technical reasons, the Community could not join the IATTC, the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain to accede to the IATTC Convention on an exceptional basis."
"That accession took place in Guatemala in 2003."
"The decision foresaw that Spain would participate in IATTC decisions in line with the Community position and in close cooperation with the Commission, which guaranteed the Community’s effective participation in the IATTC."
"I am therefore of the opinion –– and this is an opinion –– that the report must call –– perhaps the Commission could enlighten us in this regard –– for the definitive ratification of the AIPCD by the European Union, and not its accession to this Convention."
"I would also like to make a comment on Amendments 11 and 12."
"At no point does the Regulation talk about the ‘dolphin-safe’ label; that label, as such, does not exist."
"What Article 3 of the Regulation does contain is a series of definitions which include what is understood by ‘‘dolphin-safe tuna’."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I believe that we perhaps need to be a little more realistic about the issue we are discussing."
". Mr President, once again I wish to thank this House, and in particular the Committee on Fisheries and its rapporteur, Mr Freitas, for their cooperation."
"The objective is a shared one."
"It is important for the Commission to enhance its role in regional fisheries organisations in supporting conservation measures that are put in place not only in European but also in international waters."
"Membership of the organisation will help us attain higher standards as regards by-catches of cetaceans."
"Since the establishment of the AIDCP, the by-catch of cetaceans has dropped from 150 000 to 1 500."
"This in itself is a great success and worthy of support."
"The rapporteur and other speakers raised the issue of eco-labelling."
"Firstly, the option of the AIDCP ‘dolphin safe’ certificate by the Community is currently being examined by the Member States."
"In addition, the Commission will be adopting a proposal on eco-labelling within a couple of weeks, which will clearly feed into the process of considering whether to adopt the AIDCP certificate."
"The communication will set out three options for consideration: retaining the status quo, having a mandatory Community-wide label or setting minimum criteria."
"At this stage, the Commission is leaning towards the third option, and we look forward to a constructive debate with Parliament and the Council."
"In conclusion, I wish to assure you of the Commission’s and my own personal commitment to continuing to work towards minimising discards and by-catch, especially of cetaceans."
"I count on the support of this House, so that we can work together in achieving improvements in our current practices and methods."
"With regard to the ratification process, I have taken note of your comments, and the ratification will probably take place in the near future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0125/2005) by Mr Őry, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social inclusion in the new Member States (2004/2210(INI))."
". –I am delighted that such broad consensus, encompassing virtually the whole political spectrum, has emerged among the political groups in Parliament concerning the report on social inclusion."
"This is no coincidence."
"It is because we are barely a year into enlargement and there is no doubt that an increase in momentum, in both social and economic terms, would definitely be in the interests of the Union."
"In this regard, speeding up the process of social inclusion is by no means an issue of secondary importance; the facts show clearly that the new Member States lag behind, to a much greater extent than the old ones, in this area and therefore have a great deal of catching up to do."
"I think we all agree that we do not want a two-speed Europe, a Union where the social protection system is highly developed and of a high standard in one half, while in the other half, it is as full of holes as an Emmental cheese and eroding further, year on year due to government financial difficulties, government budget constraints, restrictive measures and similar difficulties."
"If such a situation were to arise, then there really would be grounds for concern about social dumping, which we all regard as undesirable."
"This is why it is important in the period that lies ahead to make genuine progress, perceptible to everyone, in the field of social inclusion."
"This is the only way we can prevent other social groups in the new Member States from falling into social exclusion."
"If this were to happen, it would have negative consequences in terms of labour market stability, economic output and social cohesion and would give rise to a whole range of other problems."
"The report is a kind of inventory of the prevailing problems and it paints a fairly accurate picture of the processes currently under way."
"As regards disadvantaged sections of society, it covers almost every social group affected, focusing particularly on the situation of older people, women, minorities that suffer discrimination – including the Roma – as well as homeless people, people suffering from addiction-related problems, people living with disabilities, children at risk and immigrants."
"It places particular emphasis on the close links between the provision of education and training opportunities and improved prospects for the disadvantaged citizens accessing them."
"In the short time-frame available to me, I would like to continue by highlighting just three of the cardinal issues of the report."
"The first key element is that it is crucial in terms of our future prospects of catching up to recognising the particularly close link that exists between job creation and the economic policies promoting it, and the social systems that represent the primary pillars of social inclusion."
"It follows logically from this that social inclusion policy can only be successful if it goes in tandem with, is based on and builds on, an appropriate economic policy."
"If we fail to ensure that the two are in harmony, failure in the social sphere will be inevitable."
"The second key element in fact is a structural problem."
"I am thinking here of the indebtedness of local authorities, which has recently accelerated to a dangerous degree and is closely connected to the fact that local authority finances have been unable to keep pace with the expansion of their social duties."
"This is not a problem that is exclusive to the new Member States; it is a familiar phenomenon in the old Member States too."
"Of course it is perfectly logical that governments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, should try to address the majority of problems at local level and the reasoning that most information is always available at local level is perfectly valid."
"For this to work, however, financial resources need to be provided and this has unfortunately failed to happen in recent years."
"As a consequence, we now find ourselves in a situation where, for example – if I may cite an alarming case in point – the combined local authority debt of the four ‘Visegrád’ countries has now exceeded the psychological barrier of 10 billion euros."
"Debt on this scale certainly gives grounds for common reflection at the very least."
"For my third point, I would like to refer to the matter of cooperation."
"It is true – and the report does not dispute this – that social policy is an area of national responsibility of Member States."
"And so it should be."
"However, the ability to exercise national competences is by no means impeded by exchanging good practice and sharing information; furthermore, it is in the fundamental interests of all of us."
"Alongside serious problems, we need to see that there are hosts of good initiatives, innovative ideas that point the way forward and successful projects."
"Why should we not share these with each other?"
"Unfortunately, the situation at present is that the new Member States pay too little attention to each other and so in most cases, things that could potentially be common treasures, stay hidden and others are unaware of their existence."
"Appropriate institutional frameworks for this are lacking too."
"So, in my opinion, these are the three main areas in which we need to make substantive progress."
"Allow me once again to express my thanks to the political groups and to my colleagues for their highly constructive and helpful support throughout the process of drafting the report."
". Mr President, the Commission congratulates Mr Őry on his excellent and comprehensive report on social inclusion in the new Member States."
"It is a very timely and helpful report, which should significantly strengthen our efforts to promote social inclusion across the Union."
"Most of the points and policy priorities recommended in the document are very much in line with, and reinforce, the Commission's own analysis of the situation."
"The report is also very useful as it draws attention to a number of issues that require greater emphasis and more effort from Member States and the Commission."
"The importance of tackling poverty and social exclusion and building a more inclusive Union was reinforced in the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Brussels."
"The social inclusion process will operate in parallel with and complement the Lisbon agenda, focusing on economic growth and employment."
"In that way our efforts in the areas of economic growth, employment policy and social cohesion can reinforce each other."
"The ongoing mid-term evaluation of the EU's social inclusion process will, towards the end of the year, lead to a communication proposing new integrated and streamlined common objectives and working methods for the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion."
"The points raised in your resolution are a very valuable contribution to the current evaluation of the process."
"We will take them into account when we prepare our communication."
"We have been making significant progress on several issues raised in the report since the Commission and the new Member States prepared their joint memoranda on social inclusion in 2003."
"I should like to mention two of them: harmonisation of statistics and the exchange of learning."
"You rightly emphasise the importance of harmonising poverty statistics and criteria defining poverty."
"There has been very good cooperation between the national statistics offices and Eurostat in developing our new statistical instrument, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC."
"That will certainly help us monitor progress across the Union."
"As regards the exchange of good practice, the new Member States have been playing an increasingly active role in the current Community Action Programme on Social Exclusion."
"The proposed new Community Action Programme (Progress) will, from 2007, allow us to further extend the exchange of learning and good practice."
"Another important issue raised in the report is increasing the resources available for social inclusion matters."
"In this regard responsibility rests primarily with the national authorities."
"However, the Commission put strong emphasis on ensuring that the use of European social funds is closely connected with the goals indicated in the national action plans on employment and social inclusion."
"As clearly stated in the resolution, improvement is required in almost all the dimensions of social life."
"At the same time, most new Member States are undergoing difficult economic reforms and many are faced with high levels of unemployment."
"There are also significant budgetary constraints, which limit the room for manoeuvre for social policy."
"We have to be realistic and bold in addressing these major structural issues."
"Ensuring economic and employment growth will certainly help to increase social cohesion, but investing in social inclusion and human capacity is an essential complementary element in supporting sustainable employment and economic progress."
"The report will help ensure that we continue to have a strong social inclusion process."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of the joint memorandums on social inclusion by all of the new Member States and by the Commission marks a clear political commitment aimed at putting the fight against poverty and social exclusion at the heart of every national policy."
"Parliament supports and upholds this step."
"Our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls in particular on the Commission to succeed in outlining a common policy in the form of a common theme, a clear policy shared by all of the Member States."
"In order to do this, the European Commission has to consider the appropriateness of choosing the open method of coordination, which is clearly unable to fully achieve the assigned objective; make sufficient funds available for the project, in order to make the citizens and residents of the new Member States more involved in the European project; carry out an evaluative across-the-board analysis, refocusing on the failure to respect civil liberties, access to fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, and facilitate the task of preparing any sanctions that may be needed; highlight more clearly the problems relating to access to the law and justice, with a more detailed analysis of migration patterns, distinguishing between immigration of third-country nationals and the situation of other ethnic or cultural minorities; review the existing division of responsibilities between the Union, the Member States and the regions, and propose means of institutionalising the ‘best practice’ approach; ensure access to the legal system for vulnerable groups and minorities; unify, streamline and simplify the emergency procedures and resolve the remaining problems regarding stateless or other persons in difficulty who continue to be denied citizenship or the right of residence."
"As a result of these efforts concerning fundamental rights, the European Union can develop towards achieving a greater level of justice and shared civic values, which are the foundations of the social Europe that we all hope and pray for."
". The report on social inclusion in the new Member States highlights a wide range of new challenges."
"The rapporteur has identified these challenges very clearly, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work."
"Poverty and the related problem of social inclusion have a specific dimension in the new Member States."
"This is not only because the poverty threshold is considerably lower in absolute terms, which means that poverty is ultimately more severe than in the 15 old Member States; it is also because poverty takes on special forms for the women of these countries."
"All sources indicate that single parents and older women are the most likely to face a greater risk."
"The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality therefore highlights extreme forms of poverty and an absolute shortage of comparable and reliable data."
"However, there is a very dangerous phenomenon that seems to be emerging, and which has been overshadowed by data on the adult population, namely the high risk of child poverty."
"Although analyses indicate that poverty affecting children is often more severe and that the number of children facing the risk of poverty is increasing, exact figures are not available."
"University research conducted in 2001 estimated that the risk of child poverty in the old Member States exceeded that of the adult population by as much as 14%."
"A national report on youth policy which was published in my country yesterday states that the proportion of children facing poverty is 30%, or as much as 40% for those in single families."
"It is impossible to ignore the correlation between this figure and the alarmingly high number of early school-leavers: 14% of girls and 18% of boys in Europe in 2004."
"Ladies and gentlemen, poverty is generally said to have a woman’s face."
"We should perhaps modify this generalisation: poverty has a child’s face."
"When considering implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Inclusion Strategy, we should bear this in mind."
". – Mr President, there is clearly a very real problem of social exclusion for many people in many of the new Member States."
"This report highlights some of the problems and some of the causes."
"It also pinpoints some of the solutions."
"However, what is so impressive is that this report does not come from an MEP from one of the old Member States, lecturing the newcomers on what they should do to catch up; this rapporteur comes from one of the new Member States."
"He writes with passion and knowledge about the problem, because he understands what needs to be done, because he is not afraid to pinpoint failings in his own country, and because he cares."
"He is a perfect example of one of the many talented MEPs who have joined this Parliament following enlargement."
"He is right to flag the need for better education and right to raise the importance of increased funding by central government in this regard."
"He is also right to talk about improving labour mobility, because unless there is more flexibility in the labour markets, the economies cannot fulfil their growth potential and the funds will simply not be there for governments to spend."
"There is a lesson here, too, for older Member States."
"Finally, I welcome the wisdom of the rapporteur and I congratulate him strongly on his report."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by thanking our colleague, Mr Őry, for his excellent report."
"I would remind the House that the report he has drafted on social inclusion in the new EU Member States, which we are today discussing together, was approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by a majority of 32 votes to 4."
"The result of the vote is, then, a clear demonstration that we all, across the political spectrum, recognise and acknowledge the urgency of problems relating to social exclusion."
"Nonetheless, we are not unfamiliar with this finding."
"We all know that representatives of European governments and countries came to the same conclusions at the Lisbon summit in 2000, when the war on poverty and social exclusion was made one of the central topics and conditions for modernising the European social model."
"Despite certain hesitations, this view was also confirmed at this year’s spring summit in Brussels."
"Looking at the results achieved during the last five years, it is clear that the war on poverty and social exclusion is nowhere near over, and that considerable efforts and resolve will be needed even after 2010."
"The European Commission has undertaken a truly difficult task in comparing the state of social exclusion in the 10 new Member States."
"These countries differ not only from each other; fundamental differences also exist between the regions within them."
"Although there is still room for elaborating and harmonising common indicators that would most faithfully reflect the actual situation in these countries and, at the same time, enable us to discover examples of new practices, this action by the European Commission is undoubtedly a step forward."
"I would like to use this occasion to call on its representatives to cooperate as closely as possible in the future and to make use of the resources and knowledge of non-governmental organisations and social partners."
"I would also like to mention the fact that although the report that we have before us today describes and endeavours to compare the situations in the 10 new Member States, we must not forget that the threat of poverty and social exclusion is faced by every EU Member State, albeit not to the same degree."
"The opinion is often expressed that social partners, and in particular trade union organisations, should be closely involved in all measures in order to help solve the problem of social exclusion; indeed, the question of whether they should take over the functions of state and local authority has even been considered."
"Such opinions are no more than an illusion, however, at least in the meantime."
"The restructured trade unions in the new Member States are in a difficult situation; they are subject to pressure, they lack the necessary structures and they do not have effective tools available to them."
"Mr Őry is well aware of this, as am I, since we have both worked in trade unions."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what one might think, today’s debate on the report on social inclusion in the new Member States is very much linked to the urgent issues we have been discussing since the start of this part-session."
"I refer to the Constitutional Treaty and the Financial Perspective."
"An understanding of the most complex social problems faced by the Member States and a desire to solve these problems would render moot many of the arguments put forward by those who voted against the Constitution."
"The reason for this is that many issues relating to EU enlargement were either misrepresented to these voters or misunderstood by them."
"The Őry report is thus concerned with solutions to problems that have a direct bearing on the EU’s future."
"Our debate on this issue, and the majority by which the House adopts the report, will prove that we are aware of the significance of this problem, and that we know it involves banishing the spectre of social dumping from the European Union."
"What is more, the fact that the goals of competitiveness and social cohesion as enshrined in the Lisbon strategy are complementary rather than mutually exclusive is emphasised."
"This was why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlined the importance of economic development in facilitating social inclusion during its debates on the report, and indeed the Commissioner also stressed this aspect of the issue a short while ago."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to congratulate Mr Őry on the way in which this report has been drafted."
"I am delighted that the aforesaid Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted it by an overwhelming majority."
"Improvements could perhaps have been made to the way in which the proposed amendments were incorporated."
"In fact a number of the amendments I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were ignored, even though they would have improved the report without making any fundamental changes."
"The report we are debating today is an excellent one, and my group will vote in favour of it."
". – Mr President, my Group supports the report on social inclusion in the new Member States and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Őry, on his report."
"I wish to make some comments about the process of EU integration."
"In the majority of the new Member States, the only social stratum benefiting from EU accession is the national, economic and political elite."
"As can be seen in the report, the gap between rich and poor has become wider."
"For example, in my country, Latvia, a recent opinion poll showed that 84% of the population thought that their standard of living was much better ten years ago."
"The national, economic and political elite is mostly responsible for the current social disintegration in their countries."
"However, because they have ignored the unfavourable changes in the new EU Member States, the EU institutions must bear part of the blame."
"The social instability in the new Member States is endangering political stability and economic growth not only in those states, but also in the EU as a whole."
"This is the result of a number of mistakes made by EU institutions during the enlargement process."
"One such mistake was to ignore the fact that in two Baltic States, Latvia and Estonia, a significant part of the population is stateless."
"These so-called ‘aliens’ belong to national minorities, and the fact that they are deprived of political rights promotes social exclusion and means that persons belonging to minorities cannot compete on equal terms in the labour market"
"Unfortunately, yesterday, during the vote on the amendments to the report by Mr Moraes on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies, the recommendations that these people should be given the right to participate in local elections and granted freedom of movement within the Community were removed as a result of the amendments tabled by some political groups."
"This totally ignores the EU's own recommendations made in 2004 as part of the enlargement process."
". – I would like to give my opinion on the work of our colleague, Mr Őry."
"I welcome the fact that this is the first such report to be drafted by a Member from a new Member State."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing crises everywhere we turn in today’s European Union."
"The smaller countries adhere to the Stability Pact, while the larger ones adhere to other principles."
"All this affects the new Member States, which are still being called on to comply fully with a raft of often nonsensical measures, as the previous speaker rightly emphasised."
"Social problems principally affect poor regions, regardless of whether these are located in old or new Member States."
"Disabled people currently account for 10% of the population, yet only a few countries can be said to have legislation in place that makes at least partial improvements to the everyday situation of these people, including at work."
"Problems are faced by national minorities, school-leavers, women and the over-fifties."
"People from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds represent a major problem, and refugees are starting to become one."
"What is the main problem faced by the European Union as a whole?"
"The problem is a system that strives to leave everything to the invisible hands of the market."
"I should like to cite just three examples by way of illustration."
"The privatisation of drinking water sources and sewage systems has increased the price of a cubic metre of water more than a thousand-fold."
"My second example, the enormous pressure to liberalise the rental market, means that 50-70% of pensioners’ incomes in the new European Union countries is now spent on accommodation."
"And what about tomorrow?"
"Few flats are being built, the mobile labour force often lives in critical conditions, and the situation for unemployed people, young families, disabled persons and pensioners is becoming critical."
"A third example is disabled people, who form an ever-greater proportion of the unemployed."
"In the Czech Republic, in northern Bohemia, say, the rate of unemployment among disabled people has risen from 8% 10 years ago to over 12%, despite the measures that have been taken."
"This is a stark warning."
"People are being asked to join a society where public services have been shut down, public transport is expensive in spite of ever more threadbare networks, crèches are being abolished and the number of nursery schools reduced, after-school activities are being done away with or scaled down, which often involves high financial demands on parents, and the status of trade unions is worsening, as a result of attempts to abolish the labour code."
"All these are manifestations of extreme liberal tendencies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do you think that our citizens are blind to the extreme liberal language of the Constitutional Treaty?"
"Do you know nothing of the topics discussed in the debate held prior to the referenda in France and Holland?"
"Do you want statistical shortcomings to increase pressure on the new Member States, which are being forced into the ruthless privatisation of all state property?"
"Do you not know that the new Member States are becoming an experimental terrain for the original 15 Member States, in order to test how much more people can take?"
"Am I right, ladies and gentlemen, or is the ‘social state’ dead and we are heading in a completely different direction?"
"It is to be welcomed that we have before us a draft report on social inclusion."
"The fundamental questions are covered in it, as well as being scattered between the lines, even though our future direction, including basic social standards, is still missing."
"This is a step in the right direction, but a small and timid one."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, since we are discussing social inclusion, we should not forget that around 150 million EU citizens have an income of less than 75% of the EU average."
"Two thirds of these people live in the new Member States."
"On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his accurate depiction of this complex problem, the solution to which is to slash the number of areas of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion."
"The latter are frequently interrelated, and are sometimes passed on from one generation to the next, which is a point I should like to stress."
"All our strategies and debates will be worthless unless they achieve certain goals."
"Firstly, they must make it possible for rapid assistance to be provided to those who need it."
"This is an important albeit short-term goal that requires appropriate funding."
"Secondly, they must eliminate poverty, which is the main cause of social disintegration, or at the very least greatly reduce it."
"This is a long-term goal, and in order to achieve it we will need to boost the economic regeneration of the new regions, thus mitigating the scourge of unemployment."
"Today I should like to pay tribute to all those working to achieve these goals throughout the EU, especially in the 10 new Member States."
"I should therefore like to thank local governments and NGOs, including in particular Caritas, as well as social welfare institutions and philanthropists for the work they do."
"I should like to thank those who create new jobs."
"If I may, I should like to dwell upon just two issues in detail."
"The first of these is the family."
"Demographic indicators are causing alarm bells to ring, and assistance for families raising children is a necessity rather than generosity on anyone’s part."
"We need to find the right solutions."
"Secondly, there are over 45 million disabled people in the EU."
"They should at long last be made to feel that they have the same rights as any other EU citizen."
"Finally, there is also a moral dimension to the issues under debate."
"It is far from easy for a man who has eaten his fill to understand a man who is hungry."
"Mr President, the Őry report is a valuable document that highlights the ongoing social disintegration of the new Member States."
"The post-Communist countries have experienced so many changes and transformations over a short space of time that our heads are still spinning."
"One-time Communists quickly found their feet in this new situation."
"After plundering state coffers, they metamorphosed into businessmen or remained in politics."
"The weakest in society, and by this I mean whole social classes, have been the least able to find their bearings in the new set-up."
"Workers have lost their jobs and found themselves in debt after being deprived of their means of production and their markets."
"Health care is no longer accessible to everyone."
"The welfare state has downed tools, and citizens have discovered they have been left to their own resources overnight."
"Polish citizens do not have much faith in their own politicians."
"Instead, they place their trust in the EU and pin great hopes on it."
"More money is needed to achieve our ambitious goals of social inclusion, job creation and the promotion of entrepreneurship."
"This is a strategically important stage of the debate on the EU budget, and the Commission and the Council should not forget that every euro invested in the new Member States remains in the EU’s pocket and amounts to investing in the EU itself."
"The debate is suspended here to leave time for the vote."
"The debate will resume this afternoon."
"Csaba Őry's report draws our attention to an important problem."
"The task facing the ill-equipped local authorities in the new Member States is huge: the low levels of economic activity and to an extent low levels of employment; the modest resources available for allocation to health care in nominal terms despite the fact that the amounts are not proportionally smaller; the particular shortcomings of the education system and social exclusion of minorities."
"They are supposed to give greater emphasis to activities aimed at the inclusion of disadvantaged social groups by means of their integration and indeed participation, as this area is the wellspring both of the problems that threaten our social cohesion and of the competitiveness we seek."
"Failure to do so will make it impossible to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"In order to speed up the process of social inclusion, a change in attitude is needed;"
"Member States, local authorities, the private sector and civil sector alike must all assume a share of the responsibility – without prejudice!"
"Much more funding needs to be allocated for this purpose."
"Inter-institutional cooperation needs to be better coordinated."
"Those who voted no to the Constitution were expressing their bitter disappointment concerning the question of Europe’s ability to confront its biggest challenge, namely increasing competitiveness while at the same time retaining the European social model."
"The existing system of coordination is inadequate and so is the added value that we can expect from the economic research institute"
"In the social welfare sector, new projects are needed that reflect the European dimension of social policy, high-quality projects that provide regular information to those affected and seek to involve them."
"Later on, this could even take on the concrete form of a common research institute, an organisational expression of the essence of social Europe, examining the social and institutional conditions for enhancing competitiveness and exploring the management of social issues within an innovative paradigm."
"After all, the best social policy, without a doubt, is redistribution of employment opportunities across society and provision of labour market training."
"I speak from experience when I say that this dimension has so far been completely neglected in the new Member States, where immigration is not yet reflected at the level of communication."
"Let them be able to draw pensions, too, irrespective of the applicant’s age, gender or origin, in all Member States of the European Union."
"The competent Italian authorities have communicated a request for the waiver of Mr Marco Pannella’s parliamentary immunity in view of criminal proceedings before the Rome District Court."
"In accordance with Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the request has already been referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has competence in this area."
"Whilst a debate on the communication in question is not planned, I believe that it is appropriate to give the floor, albeit very briefly, to Mr Pannella."
"Mr President, I asked to take the floor to raise a point of order, in accordance with Rule 6(2), to which you have referred."
"I wished to inform you and the House that this request for waiver, of which you have notified us, must be reconciled with the fact that Parliament already turned down the request for waiver of immunity almost unanimously on 10 February 2004, hence a year and a half ago now."
"We have established that the decision was duly communicated to the competent Italian authorities by both Parliament and the Italian delegation on 23 February 2004, and that it was published in the Official Journal of 22 April 2004."
"This new request – which will once again waste our time – therefore demonstrates that, in addition to spaghetti in clam sauce, we also export ‘clam justice’ everywhere, which is not always palatable."
"Thank you, Mr Pannella. The competent committee will certainly be able to give its opinion on the merits of the case."
"The next item is the vote."
"– Mr President, I may perhaps be a bit late in calling halt, but this is an important question relating to Amendment 15 to paragraph 27."
"This paragraph discusses the abuse of children in Africa by UN troops, and the amendment asserts that the UN did not do enough to investigate it."
"For a start, that has nothing whatever to do with the reform of the UN, and, moreover, what it says bears no relation to the investigations the UN is carrying out."
"I believe I just saw that a majority supports our amendment aimed at deleting this paragraph, and I would ask you, if at all possible, to check this again."
"Mr Laschet, I do beg your pardon."
"I certainly appreciate the merits of the matter but the procedure does not allow me to put to the vote again an amendment that has already been put to the vote and rejected."
"– Mr President, Mr Laschet is quite right."
"Our group joined with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in voting for this paragraph to be deleted."
"You said that the amendment failed; it was in fact adopted, and the paragraph was deleted."
"You have come to the wrong conclusion."
"The motion was carried, and this paragraph has therefore been deleted."
"Mr Leinen, I will confirm it – I am obviously always willing to double-check, inasmuch as nobody is infallible: it seems that the groups wished to vote, Members did not raise their hands, the vote was carried out and unfortunately I had to acknowledge the outcome of the vote."
"No recount was requested and I cannot set a negative precedent on the voting procedures."
"I am the first to regret this but I have to proceed with voting time."
"We believe that it should be up to individual Member States to adopt positions on possible support for the agreement on the conservation of dolphins."
"This is not an issue that should be dealt with by the European Parliament."
". As the report says, SMEs account for over 95% of the enterprises in the Union."
"They therefore play an important economic and social role and consequently deserve greater Community support."
"Just as in previous reports, however, the emphasis is placed on measures which, under the guise of working towards competitiveness, in reality act against the interests of micro-enterprises and SMEs and work in favour of the large corporations, the large economic and financial groups and the multinationals."
"For example, we disagree that the ongoing ‘structural change’ in the EU is beneficial and to be encouraged."
"Thousands of jobs are on the line and ‘change’ of this kind has enormous economic and social ramifications."
"Whereas the rapporteur notes that the analysis of ‘structural change’ is incomplete, she also says that there is no indisputable data on relocation and confines herself to suggesting that the Council should commission a report."
"The truth is that large numbers of relocations are happening, with disastrous consequences. More effective measures must therefore be taken to prevent rising unemployment and worsening standards of living."
".– European industry is undergoing major hardships at the moment."
"In actual fact, it is subject to a formidable scissor effect between, on the one hand, the unilateral opening up of the European markets to unrestrained global competition and, on the other, the dogmatic policies of the EU: a policy of competition that prevents any European champions from emerging and prevents support for new activities that the market alone would not be able to bring to the fore; and regulations in every field, which increase the constraints and costs, and the list goes on."
"What is becoming of industrial competitiveness when we see 1 200 pages of the REACH Directive on the chemicals industry, a genuine regulatory monster, none of which anyone understands, apart from the fact that, as it stands, it risks increasing the number of business closures and relocations and sounding the death knell for European research in that sector."
"Not all of Mr Vlasto’s proposals are bad."
"However, the major fault of his report is to consider ultraliberal globalisation as an inescapable reality and as fundamentally beneficial and only to see solutions, as usual, in more Europe."
"By straying in this direction, the European Union has, until now, only succeeded in creating unemployment, poverty, disappointment and rejection."
". European industry is undergoing structural changes, due to international factors, but more so for internal reasons."
"Apart from the first phase of coal and steel, the EU has turned its back on its industry, despite it being a source of jobs, economic growth, services, skills and know-how that no developed economy can afford to underestimate."
"The EU must therefore channel all its efforts into a consistent and proactive policy towards its industry, a policy that can both anticipate structural change and develop a sound and competitive industrial base."
"European industry has no choice but to invest in its strengths, such as its human potential, its capacity for innovation and its SME-based entrepreneurial fabric, thereby setting itself apart from its competitors."
"This support for industrial policy involves balanced development that maintains social cohesion."
"We must not lose sight of the impact of recent relocations on the regions."
"Structural funds such as the European Social Fund could be channelled into supporting socio-economic and industrial retraining in the worst affected regions."
"One solution would be to create synergies between businesses, universities and research centres, thereby providing a lasting foundation for industrial activity in a given region."
"In March 2005, the Council carried out a review of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), with a view to making it a more flexible and streamlined instrument."
"The Council opted to place the emphasis more firmly on the ‘G’ of Growth than the ‘S’ of Stability, in light of the current economic recession that the EU is experiencing."
"The SGP thus became more politicised."
"This review fell short of what was required, however, for a number of reasons, of which I shall highlight two."
"Firstly, reform was only needed because some Member States chose, consciously or otherwise, not to observe its rules."
"Worse still, the EU laid down rules that, quite apart from not being implemented, led to a lax and scarcely credible sanctions process."
"The Member States are both the judge and the defendant, and would rather fail to implement the SGP than impose sanctions on one of their peers."
"Being responsible for monitoring the process, the Commission must be granted powers to impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance."
"Secondly, any sanction must act as a deterrent and not solely as a punishment."
"Imposing a non-compliance fine on a Member State with budget difficulties is counterproductive."
"Other sanctions should be put in place, such as suspending ECOFIN voting rights."
".– This report has provided the opportunity for a productive collaboration between the three European institutions and industry, resulting in an agreement on environmental needs."
"Agreement was reached on a fundamental point, the withdrawal of harmful PAH substances and the introduction of safer alternatives."
"The European Parliament has agreed to grant industry an extra year in order to meet this objective and authorises the sale of existing stocks of which there is not, in the end, a very large quantity."
"We have here a case in which environmental ambition has boosted research and is enabling this industrial sector, and therefore employment, to be strengthened and the quality of products to be improved."
"It is therefore possible to draw a conclusion at first reading."
". As I said in my speech in plenary, this reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is woefully inadequate."
"What we really need is to suspend the SGP and to make a complete break from the economic guidelines in place in order to create the macro-conditions to revitalise the economy and to create more jobs."
"That is why we advocate a genuine Growth, Employment and Social Progress Pact."
"A further reason why we voted against was that the rapporteur seeks to involve the European Central Bank and proposes that the Commission should carry out financial auditing on the Member States."
"This is a perfect example of a report that loses sight of the underlying reasons behind the ‘no’ vote on the so-called ‘European Constitution’ in France and the Netherlands, and of the need to address the people’s concerns."
".– The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact proposed to us now is only marginal, but it is no less important as a consequence."
"What is regrettable is that it will have taken eight years in order to realise that the rise in deficits did not come about solely on the basis of the disastrous and completely arbitrary figure of 3% of GDP, but also as a result of ‘relevant factors’: continually weak growth, ageing populations, the consequences of the botched enlargement of the EU or of unfettered globalisation, and so on."
"That is not enough, however."
"The Europe of Brussels has just spent the last ten years sacrificing millions of jobs in adhering to dogmatic quantified targets (3% of GDP for government deficits, 60% for government debt or, again, a maximum inflation rate fixed by the European Central Bank at 2%)."
"It must now make employment and the prosperity of its people its primary objective, to which all, absolutely all, other objectives must give way, whatever may be the views expressed on the matter by the Frankfurt Bank, the zealots of pure and perfect competition or those of completely unrestrained global free trade."
"We are unsympathetic to the EU having to provide financial support to the fishing industry in connection with biological recovery periods."
"That position does not mean that we support the Commission’s proposal."
"We are well disposed to individual wordings in Parliament’s report, for example to the effect that measures relating to highly migratory species are to be laid down by regional fisheries organisations."
"We are voting against the report as a whole because we do not believe that the EU should work on fisheries issues."
"We recommend that regional fisheries issues be handled through cooperation between the countries concerned."
"Mr President, this report does not solve any problems whatever; it only serves to aggravate the ones that already exist."
"It repeatedly pleads for new legal immigration, while most Member States do not know how to address the problems this already brings with it, such as the level of unemployment and crime among certain groups of immigrants, which is significantly higher than in the indigenous population."
"Nor can we avoid the conclusion that large groups of immigrants deliberately choose not to integrate."
"Even if we were to adopt a thousand reports like the Gaubert report, containing new repressive measures against Europeans who avail themselves of their right to free expression of opinion in order to voice their dissatisfaction with the situation, it would not make the slightest bit of difference."
"This is talk for talk’s sake, and it will come as no surprise to you that I have voted against the Gaubert report."
"– Mr President, if broad swathes of the European public have problems with mass immigration, what this indicates is not that they are xenophobic, but that the immigrants in question are poorly integrated."
"Consideration of the facts makes it clear why this is so."
"Let us take note of the fact that Germany has at least 3.5 million Muslims living in it, some of them for 40 years, who can still scarcely speak any German."
"Let us also take note of the estimates according to which, in a few decades’ time, half the inhabitants of France and, quite possibly, one third of the population of German cities such as Stuttgart, will be of the Islamic faith."
"Let us perhaps give some thought to the regions of Italy in which illegal immigrants are responsible for one third or even one half of all criminal offences."
"Let us consider how, in Spain, home to over a million Muslims, calls are even now being made to allow Cordoba Cathedral to be used as a mosque again."
"All this is evidence that these immigrants are very poorly integrated."
"It is essential that they should not only learn the languages of the countries to which they come to live, but also assume as their own the culture and history of their new homelands."
"If they fail to do so, the European states will, in a few decades’ time, have no idea whatever of their own identity."
". Given that the entry of economic migrants lies at the heart of any immigration policy, a joint legal framework must be created and integration policies must be stepped up, setting out basic common principles as regards the integration of legal immigrants."
"Three key axes must therefore be put in place:"
"- the promotion of legal immigration, as part of a global and horizontal approach, commensurate with each Member State’s actual capacity; special emphasis must be placed on working in tandem with countries of origin and transit, not least by means of information campaigns."
"- effective integration of immigrants, with reception and integration policies that must take account of the each Member State’s characteristics and historical ties."
"A range of common rights for all migrants in the EU should be drawn up, yet we must not lose sight of the fact that excessive ‘generosity’ in granting further rights, such as the right to vote, may result in more resistance and be the source of unwanted xenophobia."
"- resolutely combating illegal immigration; attempts must be made to put a stop to illegal immigration, if possible in the country of origin, and to problems relating to the economic exploitation of migrants. All forms of trafficking in human beings must also be prevented, and punished where they do occur."
"In order to avoid constructing a Fortress Europe, it is important for us not to create a uniform European asylum and immigration policy."
"Each Member State should be free to conduct, if it so wishes, a more generous policy in this area, something that is impeded if the Member States are hamstrung by common EU standards."
"The June List cannot, therefore, support the report."
".– This report is, at one and the same time, monumentally trite, untrue, inept and propagandist in its pro-immigration stance."
"Trite statements appear in recital M, in which it is pointed out that a change in the migration policy of one Member State affects migration flows in other Member States."
"Those are only the obvious consequences of the Schengen Agreement and of an area without borders!"
"That does not, however, prevent Mr Gaubert from calling, in paragraph 32, for mass regularisation operations in connection with immigrants."
"The illogicality and irresponsibility of this report do not end there."
"After having called for the potential of immigration to be fully optimised and having reaffirmed the right of non-nationals not to be turned back at borders, to access the labour market and to participate in public and political life, the report points out that all of these policies must fall within the framework of the principles of solidarity and shared responsibilities laid down in the Constitutional Treaty!"
"Is it necessary to point out that that text has been buried by the twin ‘no’ vote of the French and the Dutch and by the fact that the British have put it on hold?"
"The pro-immigration lobby should come down from its ivory tower and start to listen to the voice from below, the voice of the nations."
".– This report, aimed at ‘organising’ immigration and promoting ‘integration’, is a classic of its kind, coy about the causes, blind as to the consequences and completely dictatorial as to the solutions to be applied to these issues."
"In the face of an ageing European population, matched by a continuously low birth rate and a forecasted decline in the active population of around 20 million between 2005 and 2030, the rapporteur, as a right-wing Member but also as the leader of an ‘anti-racist’ organisation, plans to introduce additional immigration, which will penalise our economy and weaken our national cohesion."
"With its aim of ‘building an intercultural society’, that is to say, one organised around ethnic or religious considerations, European policy is out of touch with social and economic realities or the experience of minority groups and is potentially a source of conflict."
"In order for immigrant groups to be integrated, they must show a greater desire for this to take place and make the necessary efforts to assimilate."
"The European demagogues choose to overlook the need for a boost to the European birth rate and for a family policy worthy of the name and the urgent need to adjust our labour market to demand in order to curb unemployment."
"Finally, the report fails to address the issue of a radical form of Islam taking root on our soil, with all of the consequences that that entails for women’s rights, security and democracy."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Gaubert’s report on legal and illegal migration and integration of migrants."
"We are, however, aware of the fact that parts of the report concern an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and do not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark’s position."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night I fell asleep thinking about how I should vote on the Bowis report on patient mobility in the European Union and I dreamt of the gorgeous Italian blonde, Elena, who was complimenting me precisely at dinner."
"She was saying to me: ‘Well done, Carlo."
"Obviously, they will have to go round every hospital in Europe, but you cannot have it all in this world; you have to make do and therefore vote in favour of the report.’"
"Could I refuse to follow the advice of gorgeous blonde Elena?"
"No, and consequently I have voted in favour."
"We chose in the final vote to vote in favour of the European Parliament’s own-initiative report on patient mobility."
"We did so because we think that the text of the resolution as a whole expresses our view of healthcare."
"There are, however, parts of the European Parliament’s resolution that give expression to certain supranational ambitions, unacceptable to ourselves, in the area of healthcare."
"Each country is responsible for its inhabitants’ healthcare."
"When the latter are temporarily in another EEA country, their European Health Card entitles them to unplanned treatment there."
"That is an arrangement of which we approve and that appears to operate well."
"People are entitled to influence the way in which their tax money is used."
"If patients are freely to be able to choose healthcare in another Member State and have it paid for by their own country’s taxpayers, that principle is threatened."
"We fear, moreover, that such an arrangement would be very expensive and favour wealthy patients at the expense of the most vulnerable ones."
"We also believe that issues concerned with healthcare should not be dealt with in the draft Services Directive."
". The report by Mr Bowis on patient mobility and healthcare developments seeks to ensure the patient’s right to seek timely treatment in another Member State, if this is not available in his/her own country or not within a reasonable period of time."
"We therefore broadly welcome the report, although it falls well short of what is required and is even contradictory in some areas."
"The rapporteur believes that the Member States are responsible for arranging, funding and providing medical care and health services, although he does not mention health professionals and settles for vaguely stating that it is the Union’s responsibility to guarantee public health."
"The report also stresses the priority of maintaining and ensuring unrestricted and universal access to the public health service in any EU country, although it is not entirely clear who is going to pay."
"A further salient point is that health services are intended for people in need and cannot therefore be compared with goods offered for sale; this should therefore not be included in the general services directive."
"As matters stand, EU citizens are entitled to receive healthcare in other Member States and to have the cost of it reimbursed to them in their own countries."
"This is regarded as a natural part of the internal market."
"We welcome a uniform framework that clarifies the right to seek healthcare in another EU country."
"We are thus well disposed towards the Commission’s communication on patient mobility (COM (2004) 0301)."
"Parliament’s report deals with areas other than the measures required for achieving satisfactory rules governing the ability to receive healthcare in another EU country."
"The report deals with everything from telemedicine to EU research on patient mobility."
"We have thus chosen to vote against Parliament’s report as a whole."
". Patient mobility is a complex issue in view of the differences between national healthcare systems and medical care traditions."
"Patients must nonetheless have the right to seek timely treatment in another Member State if this is not available in their own country or not within a reasonable period of time."
"A coherent policy on patient mobility that sets out guidelines for use by patients, health professionals and funding agencies must be developed as a matter of urgency."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, so that we can all enjoy the benefits of this positive step for the Community."
"I should also like to emphasise that healthcare services are for people in need and cannot therefore be compared to goods for sale. This issue therefore needs a separate Commission proposal and should not be included in the general services directive."
"Lastly, now that the European Health Card has been created, the Commission must monitor its implementation in the Member States to ensure that they are providing clear and comprehensible information about how the card works."
".– I have voted in favour of my fellow MEP’s, Mr Bowis’s, excellent report on patient mobility."
"It is a document that points out a number of obvious facts: health care is a priority issue in the Europe of 25, since 10% of national GDPs is dedicated to it."
"Health care is, in essence, a national policy, the great fabric of social cohesion, which is today faced with two major challenges: ensuring that every citizen has access to treatment and managing the explosion in health care budgets in the majority of the Member States, such as Belgium."
"The specific nature of health care services justifies, in my opinion, removing health care from what is known as the Bolkestein Directive on services, as provided for by paragraph 4 of the resolution."
"Health care policy must naturally be extended to European level."
"That means that patient mobility must be promoted in the same way as that of citizen-tourists, students or businessmen."
"That justifies the implementation on the ground of the European Health Insurance Card."
"Launched in 2004 to replace the E111 form, this device is intended to allow citizens, in all cases, to assert their rights to health insurance in a simple and effective way."
". Being utterly opposed to the acquisition of statehood by the EU and the compulsion of a single foreign policy for Europe, I voted against the Resolution urging that reform of the UN should embrace a seat for the EU."
"This is a resolution driven by those consumed by a fanatical desire to usurp national authority and status."
"In my view only nation states can and should represent their citizens in the United Nations, with each free to determine their own foreign policy."
"With the defeated EU Constitution there is now even less justification than ever for this foolish proposal."
"The resolution contains quite a few constructive proposals about the ways in which the United Nations might be reformed, for example through an enlarged and more representative Security Council, more environmental work and an emphasis upon connections between development and the environment."
"In spite of this, we cannot support the report because it is simultaneously aimed at strengthening the EU’s common foreign policy, firstly through the demand that the EU countries pursue a common approach to the work on reforming the UN and, secondly, through the proposal that the EU be represented in the Security Council."
"The latter proposal clearly shows that the EU is ambitious to act as a state in international contexts, something to which we are clearly opposed."
"In our opinion, the Swedish people should make its voice heard directly in the UN, not via the EU."
". The true motives behind this resolution can be understood by reading the resolution on Transatlantic relations, debated in this plenary session, which calls for a partnership between the EU and the United States and their ‘active commitment to a reform of the UN, and in particular its Security Council, including its composition ... with the authority to grant permission for the use of force to solve international conflicts and in order to make it more effective and accountable and increase its capacity to implement its decisions’."
"In spite of its muddy language, the resolution is unable to conceal its intention to ‘legitimise’ and ‘normalise’ the adoption of ‘preventative measures’ ‘humanitarian intervention’ and ‘the possibility of using force’ by armies of EU countries ‘converted’ into forces of external intervention."
"In other words, the intention is to transform the UN into a body – with the USA pulling the strings, in tandem with the EU, by which I mean France, the United Kingdom and Germany – that ‘glosses over’ its imperialist policies, and its interference and attacks on the sovereignty of States and peoples."
"The resolution therefore endorses the ongoing militarisation of the EU and covets a seat on the Security Council for this political and military bloc in the making, once the so-called ‘European Constitution’ has been ratified."
"Hail the ‘no’ votes in the French and Dutch referenda!"
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party shares the endorsement given in this resolution to the reports by the High Level Panel and the UN Secretary General, on reform of the United Nations."
"The EPLP also fully supports reform of the UN Security Council, in order that it better reflects today's world, and calls for further improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN."
"However, it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat, as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members."
"We would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"– The motion for a resolution on the reform of the UN forms part of efforts by the imperialist powers to conduct a reactionary reform of the founding principles of the UN, in a bid to record and 'legalise' the provisional imperialist rule as 'international law'."
"The motion for a resolution and the statements by the Council and the Commission reveal how the ΕU and the USA are operating on the same frequency against the peoples and endeavouring to cloak their aggressive and barbaric policy in the mantle of the UN."
"Among other things, they want to safeguard the right of intervention and of preventive war on the pretext of combating terrorism and to export democracy, so that they can strike at countries and grass-roots movements which oppose imperialism and do not choose capitalism as their social system."
"The proposals by the UN Secretary-General dictated by the USA and the proposed EU and US positions seek to build a global mechanism consisting of the UN and the imperialist organisations (IMF, WTO, WB, G8 and so on) in order to consolidate the rule of big business."
"Nonetheless, the disagreements and infighting between them are exacerbating and, at the same time, strengthening the people's fight."
"The UN is not suffering from democratisation measures."
"What it needs is for imperialist rule to be overturned and for the correlation of powers to change so that the preconditions can be created to international relations based on equality between states and peace."
"Today’s resolution of this House on reform of the UN (B6 0328/2005, moved by Mr Laschet) advocates disturbing and aberrant developments within the United Nations by calling, , for the introduction into international law of what are termed military ‘humanitarian interventions’."
"Most seriously, though, the resolution opens the door to the possibility of pre-emptive warfare being mandated by the UN Security Council."
"Those who would like to see the UN mandating pre-emptive warfare tread international law underfoot."
"Reforming the UN in such a way would amount to the UN hallowing the principle of ‘might is right’."
"Such a ‘reform’ of the UN would endorse the dangerous concept of pre-emptive warfare; it would be no more and no less than a programme in support of war."
"This is one reason why I am very glad that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has repudiated this resolution."
"The resolution may be seen as the European Parliament’s wish list in the run-up to the forthcoming EU-US Summit on 20 June 2005 in Washington."
"It contains a variety of proposals concerning the form to be taken by cooperation between the EU and the United States in a range of areas, including security policy, the environment, energy and the economy."
"Quite a few of the demands are constructive, but we do not believe that the EU should represent 25 Member States in relation to the United States, including within the field of security policy."
"We are therefore unable to support the resolution, either."
"The resolution tabled by the Right and by the ‘socialists’ ‘wholeheartedly’ welcomes the ‘improvement in transatlantic relations’ ahead of the EU/USA summit due to take place in Washington on 20 June, and the International Conference on Iraq, jointly arranged by the USA and the EU on 22 June. It seeks to give continuity to the dangerous objectives enshrined in the so-called ‘European Constitution’ and in the ‘European Security Strategy’."
"They then reaffirm the need for ‘cooperation between the transatlantic partners based on a sound institutional structure’, to ‘resolve high-level political issues such as decisions regarding the use of force and issues regarding world order’, ‘on the clear assumption that working together brings more benefits for each partner than working in different, or indeed opposite, directions’."
"Without concealing contradictions (rivalries), the resolution calls for partnership on the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, on the ‘non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the use of nuclear energy’, on relations with China, India, Japan, Latin America and Russia, on the situation in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, on negotiations at the World Trade Organisation and on the reform of the UN."
"It also stresses that NATO should become ‘a genuine partnership of equals’ and calls for ‘a closer relationship between NATO and the EU’, which will strengthen relations between the EU and the USA."
"In other words, this is imperialism in action ..."
". The US and Europe as two global democratic systems share the same ‘non-state’ threat: terrorism and weapons proliferation."
"The need to act together to defend democratic and liberal values creates a new opportunity to renew transatlantic relations."
"Ms Rice made clear recently that the US needs and welcomes a strong, unified Europe that can speak with one voice."
"Nevertheless, this policy is not yet reflected in the US approach to EU citizens."
"Despite the fact that citizens of the new EU member countries in particular long strived for democracy and liberalism in Europe, and offered strong support to the US in its global pressure for democratisation, citizens of the new Member States are still perceived as a security threat to US home security."
"Therefore, I urge the Commission to start negotiations with the US authorities immediately, and tackle this issue as a matter of high political priority in its relations with the US."
"I urge the Commission to start immediately to negotiate the application of Visa Waiver programme for all EU citizens."
"I urge the Commission to use that call for strong, unified Europe and to ask the US to treat all EU citizens equally."
".– On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Annemie Neyts, coordinator of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, points out that the ALDE Group has voted against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and particularly against Amendments 8, 10 and 11 (climate change, new nuclear weapons and the Non-proliferation Treaty), in order to protest against the Greens’ habit of not joining in a common resolution and then of tabling amendments that have not even been debated during the negotiations on that common resolution in which the Greens played a part."
"– The motion for a resolution reconfirms the 'blood ties' between the ΕU and the USA at the expense of the peoples and the common 'values' of the imperialist barbarity which unites them."
"Despite their differences over the division of markets and lands, their effort to cooperate in order to strike at countries and peoples is manifest and is expressed in the proposal to conclude an agreement between them based on:"
"• the promotion of the 'democracy promotion' plan announced by Bush for his new term of office,"
"• the application of the US/NATO plan for controlling the Middle East,"
"• the common approach to increasing competition with China, India and Russia,"
"• the joint arrangements for setting up governments submissive to imperialism,"
"• the reactionary reform of the UN,"
"• closer links between ΝΑΤΟ and the ΕU in order to deal with grass-roots resistance."
"The EU's overall policy, including the policy projected through the joint motion for a resolution signed by the 'conservatives' and social-democrat parties, proves that the USA and the EU are two sides of the same coin."
"They highlight the need for the peoples to fight to overturn the imperialist system as a whole and to directly strengthen their struggles and their solidarity in order to repulse the new aggressive plans of the new order."
"The Greek people must not allow their country to participate in the new imperialist plans."
"The resolution on the situation in Uzbekistan is another example of the European Parliament’s ambition to strengthen the EU’s common foreign and security policy."
"We are opposed to this development."
"In our opinion, Uzbekistan is not in the neighbourhood of the EU."
"We believe that, in this particular case, other organisations – such as the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe – have a mandate to engage in conflict prevention and to strengthen human rights."
"We therefore support the call initiated by the UN with the support of, for example, the OSCE for the situation in Uzbekistan to be the subject of an independent investigation."
". High levels of unemployment and low wages have once again prompted ordinary people to give vent to their displeasure in protest actions, this time in Uzbekistan."
"A gentle revolution of the kind that took place in Georgia or Ukraine is made improbable by the absence of an organised opposition elite such as they had."
"It is a matter of certainty that Islamists are trying to turn this situation to their own advantage and that they will endeavour either to spearhead more popular uprisings or use terrorist attacks as a means towards their ends."
"Hence the threat of a civil war that would be even more explosive if reports of President Karimov being seriously ill were to turn out to be true."
"The worldwide spread of Islamic terrorist activities makes it fundamentally important that this development be counteracted and a peaceful solution sought if at all possible."
"It is for precisely this reason that the brutal repression of the uprising and the prevention of any objective investigation into it risk transforming popular dissatisfaction into an ever more frenetic spiral of violence."
"Following the events with a USD 600 million contract to supply oil to China certainly sent out the wrong message."
"Our trade agreement is worth EUR 16 million, and we should suspend it as a means towards ‘persuading’ the Uzbek Government to change course."
"That is the only way we will ever get this crisis hotspot under control."
". We voted against this report because it is a classic example of the neoliberal ideology supported by Parliament."
"The proposals that we tabled were mostly rejected."
"For example, they overlook the fact that the years since the establishment of the euro zone have been marked by slow economic and employment growth, rising unemployment rates and a transfer of productivity gains from workers to employers, as well as by the persistence of high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and income inequality in the EU."
"They also take no account of the fact that the European Employment Strategy defined in November 1997, included in the Lisbon Strategy as defined by the Council in March 2000, has been the main instrument to promote the flexibility, adaptability and mobility of the workforce, wage adjustment and changes in wage composition, and the opening up to private interests of the bulk of social security services, including pensions and health, which had a negative impact on the quality and security of the jobs created, on workers’ rights and on income distribution, as well as on the general level of productivity."
". In the increasingly globalised world markets, it is becoming difficult for European businesses to remain competitive."
"Internally, European industry is undergoing a period of intensive reconstruction with jobs being lost and manufacturing units shutting down."
"Certain regions and certain industrial sectors have seen radical changes to their employment model."
"The fact that economic growth in the EU remains below 2% is a further factor in this gloomy scenario."
"For the EU to continue to be an area of economic, social and environmental progress, the Member States must implement reforms in their labour markets with the aim of improving workers’ employability and of making work pay."
"The reform of these social and fiscal policies must be approached in a coherent way, as prerequisites for sustainable development and growth."
"Against this backdrop, the reform of the internal market, including the area of the freedom to provide cross-border services, will make it possible to achieve the economic growth that the EU requires if it is to generate more than 70% of the world’s wealth and jobs."
"– The next item is the continuation of the debate on social inclusion in the new Member States."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Öry’s report is, in my opinion, an important source of proposals, enabling the Commission and Parliament to take up the challenge of enlargement."
"In actual fact – and one is well aware of this through the debates currently enlivening the old Member States – the fear of social dumping brought about by enlargement is omnipresent, and, in my opinion, unfounded if adequate elements of a response can be found."
"I would first of all like, as is unfortunately the custom in this House, to point out to the Commission that, if funding is not made available immediately in order to implement the recommendations contained in this report, it will go unheeded, however comprehensive it may be."
"The fight against all forms of poverty and all forms of exclusion is the prerequisite for putting Europe onto the road to social progress."
"We had agreed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the responses required on the issue of social inclusion were not simply limited to the field of employment, but that they had to include other major social matters: access to education for all, without ethnic or social discrimination, in order to guarantee a common core of knowledge necessary for people to integrate effectively in society; access to quality health care for all: the fact that, even today, people can recover from cancer in one part of Europe and die from influenza in another will never be justifiable; access to housing for all, which is another of the themes of this report: council houses will have to be geographically spread out in an intelligent manner, in order to prevent any form of ghettoisation; the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether sexual discrimination in the workplace, racial discrimination or discrimination linked to disability or social circumstances, will have to be encouraged and supported."
"Europe has now to offer protection: in order to progress, it must primarily be able to protect its people."
"The basic principles of employment, housing, training and health care are the very foundation of what ought to be the construction of Europe, a Europe that serves Europeans."
"– Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report."
"Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries."
"I welcome the report in substance, but I think we should make a clear distinction between European and Member States’ responsibilities."
"The first weapon in the fight against social exclusion is of course jobs, jobs, jobs."
"We therefore need to revitalise our economy and reform our social security systems to lead people back to the labour market and not keep them in the poverty trap."
"The more or less permanent exclusion of 10% of our labour force from the labour market is an absolute disgrace to our civilised society."
"The rapporteur rightly states that combating social exclusion is best done at local level."
"It is therefore worrying that in many countries – new and old, including my own – the financial position of local authorities is becoming increasingly serious."
"Local autonomy is meaningless without the necessary financial resources."
"In fundamental rights policies and notably the fight against discrimination, the EU can and should play a key role."
"The EU has an outstanding track record on gender equality."
"It should be equally active in fighting racism and discrimination and it should be proactively defending and promoting equal rights and equal treatment for all."
"In my view, the European Commission should be less timid."
"The European Union cannot turn its head and look away if blatant discrimination takes place, arguing that it is the responsibility of Member States."
"European values are universal."
"The report highlights the importance of investing in children as the best way of promoting social inclusion."
"Giving children a good start in life and real prospects should be one of the key priorities."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the chance to state my opinion on the draft report on social inclusion in the new EU Member States."
"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and congratulating him on having made a distinction in the report between social inclusion and egalitarianism or corporatism."
"When creating special conditions for certain social groups, we must never lose sight of the fact that all citizens must be considered equal."
"Positive discrimination is as worthy of condemnation as negative discrimination."
"It is a fact that certain social groups have more or fewer differences or problems."
"I fully support solidarity with these groups."
"I am convinced that the best way to achieve their social inclusion is to create equal conditions for all of them."
"Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion."
"If we take into account the number of disadvantaged groups mentioned, and rightly so, in the report – or in other words women, single parents, people entering the job market, older people, the poor, those suffering ill health, disabled persons, carers, disadvantaged children, children under threat due to a lack of parental authority, linguistic minorities, refugees, immigrants, Roma, other ethnic minorities, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts – it would not be much of an exaggeration to conclude that ordinary, non-disadvantaged citizens are a threatened minority in society."
"I do not believe that we will need to set up support programmes for those who have not succeeded in being included in a single threatened group."
"The report under discussion aims to fight exclusion, and I believe that – paradoxically – we have excluded 10 countries from the 25 Member States, all of which have equal rights, because they joined the European Union several years later."
"I firmly believe that, next time, the European Union will also tackle this type of exclusion, and that the next report on social inclusion will evaluate the situation in all the EU Member States."
"The draft report refers to the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."
"I am aware that the rapporteur wrote his report at a time when it was not yet obvious that the Constitution had been killed off."
"Since the people of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitution for Europe, these references are groundless and should be deleted from the report."
"I thank the rapporteur for his good work, which is of benefit for the European Union and for my country."
"– Mr President, the rapporteur, and indeed the report itself, deserve credit for highlighting key issues and showing a great deal of sensitivity."
"To reiterate a point made by Mr Cabrnoch and Mrs in ’t Veld, however, the report’s exclusive focus on the new Member States is a glaring error, since the problems it discusses affect the EU as a whole."
"I should like to cite just one example, that being my own country, Poland."
"Over 60% of judges in Poland are women, and given that this is a profession of considerable social standing, it is hard to see how there can be any talk of exclusion."
"Similarly, women account for over 60% of doctors in the country, and Poland has more businesswomen in managerial roles than any other country in Europe."
"This begs the question of why a distinction has been made in the report between the old and the new Member States."
"I should also like to alert this House to the fact that events of the kind we saw a few days ago in France, when Perpignan became a battlefield between Arabs and Roma, would be unthinkable in either Poland or a great many other new Member States."
"In my opinion, the cause of the clashes was social exclusion."
"What is more, acts of anti-Semitism of the sort that occur regularly in France and Germany would also be unthinkable in the new Member States."
"The primary cause of social exclusion is destruction of the social fabric, by which I also mean the weakening of the role of religion."
"Religion, the Catholic Church and other religious organisations play an enormous role in weaving the social fabric and preventing social exclusion."
"Once again, my own country is perhaps the best example of this phenomenon, as both the divorce rate and the suicide rate in Poland are among the lowest in Europe."
"This shows that social exclusion is not in fact one of the country’s most pressing social problems."
"The modern-day state is taking on too many duties that it is incapable of performing."
"The report says that the Member States should mobilise non-governmental organisations, confessional associations and the Church to participate in combating social exclusion, and yet it must be stated quite clearly that the state cannot issue orders of this kind. The state’s primary task should be to avoid interfering in such matters."
"The final point I should like to make is that the term ‘social dumping’ appears in the report."
"This unfortunate phrase, which I find quite intolerable, now appears to have replaced the term ‘healthy competition’."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the French campaigns for the referendum, we repeatedly heard the tenors of the ‘yes’ camp in the Netherlands maintain that, in the enlarged Europe as described by the draft Constitution, there would be little risk of delocalisation, immigration of cheap labour to the richer Member States and unfair competition for SMEs in the older ones."
"In my country, Flanders, there is now evidence to the contrary, for we see the Flemish transport industry being dealt heavy blows by cheap transport companies from Eastern Europe, and there are other examples I could mention."
"I am at any rate delighted that this report on social inclusion in the new Member States, maybe quite unintentionally, puts its finger on a number of difficulties, and indicates the immense structural social differences between the new Member States, many of which today are still struggling to come to terms with the catastrophic legacy from Communist times, and the fifteen Member States prior to enlargement."
"Despite many sound proposals and suggestions – we all hope that the new Member States will achieve a level of prosperity comparable to that of their western neighbours as soon as possible – we should not be blind to the fact that social integration of the new Member States may also compromise the cohesion of the whole of the European Union."
"Consequently, when no protective measures are taken in order to avoid the risks to which our economies are exposed, and to which I have already referred, including social dumping, the reinforcement of social cohesion in the new Member States must go hand in hand with stringent measures that rule out unfair competition within the EU as a whole."
"If we do not do this, then the European leaders have not at all understood the protests by the Dutch and the French people over the past few weeks, soon, undoubtedly, to be followed by the Luxembourgers and the Danes."
"– Mr President, the subject of our debate today is one of enormous significance."
"It is a problem that affects not only the old EU Member States, but all Member States, albeit obviously to differing degrees."
"Although much research has been carried out into social inclusion in Western European countries, the scale of this problem still tends to be underestimated in the new Member States, and these countries lack the tools to measure this phenomenon in a genuinely rational and objective fashion."
"In part, of course, this is a legacy of Communism, which was a system that attempted to eliminate social problems and to bestow transient joy on all its citizens by means of decrees."
"We are still struggling with the consequences of Communism and its ideology today, and all the countries that were subjected to this system face similar levels of social problems and unemployment."
"Our countries are still lacking large-scale and complementary action plans to coordinate measures in the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"The measures that are taken all too often resemble a chaotic struggle by public services to respond to problems that have emerged, and that have usually become urgent."
"There are a great many reasons why this is the case."
"Even if we leave those social groups that suffer social marginalisation as a result of non-economic factors out of the equation, the excessively high unemployment rate remains the most pressing problem, and its causes are deeply rooted in the economy."
"Unemployment in Poland affects several dozen out of every hundred people."
"The unemployed frequently cut themselves off from society, and so this phenomenon is one of the reasons behind the sharp rise in today’s most malignant social disease, by which I mean helplessness and passivity in the face of the simplest everyday problems."
"These are always early symptoms of addiction in the broadest sense of the word, whether it be to help from the state or from others, or even to drugs or alcohol."
"Of course, the governments of the Member States can and must be called upon to take decisive steps to speed up the process of social inclusion and to develop instruments that make it possible to improve the living conditions of those most at risk."
"At the same time, however, we are all aware that substantial amounts of money will be needed to fund the majority of these measures."
"One can only spend the money one has, and not the imagined sums one would like to have."
"Any debate on genuine social inclusion must therefore be preceded by a discussion on how economic growth can be boosted in the new Member States."
"Such growth would facilitate job creation, and more jobs and higher incomes would mean that social problems and poverty could be better and more effectively combated."
"We will be unlikely to achieve our goals if we rely exclusively on public funding and social and welfare assistance."
"I therefore welcome the Commission’s assurances that it will cooperate more closely in the fight against social marginalisation."
"At the same time, I should like to encourage the Commission to be consistent in promoting greater liberalisation of the market in services."
"Such liberalisation will boost economic growth in Europe as a whole, or in other words in both the old and the new Member States, and hence reduce social problems."
"This is our only hope of effectively combating a problem that poses a threat to all of Europe, and I would stress the word ‘all’."
"– As the title of the report indicates, Europe is divided into new and old Member States."
"The report discusses social inclusion in the new Member States, yet it does not address the general social problems faced by Europe as a whole."
"Unemployment is a cruel fate for anyone, no matter where they live in Europe."
"It gives rise to many other related phenomena, be it mental stress, poverty or homelessness."
"In one part of the report, the rapporteur draws our attention to insufficient workforce mobility."
"Yet Europe’s response to the mobility of unemployed persons is to impose what are known as protective or transitional measures."
"One of the serious reservations many old Member States had about enlargement was a fear of ‘economic migration’ and of the threat to jobs for their citizens."
"What we have seen to date indicates that none of the countries that adopted transitional measures have so far filed any complaints regarding violation or avoidance of these measures."
"The countries that did not impose transitional measures on our countries, on the other hand, have not yet experienced any problems with an increased inflow of cheap labour."
"Moreover, many countries are benefiting from this cheap, well-educated and multilingual workforce, rather than complaining about it."
"One such example is the granting of ‘green cards’ to computer experts, or the massive recruitment of nurses for old people’s homes in the United Kingdom."
"Social inclusion should not only be high on our agenda during the debate on this report; we should also apply this principle with regard to other reports considered by this House."
"If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to mention the debate on problems relating to working time and compliance with the principle that all working time must be regarded as legal working time, and that all overtime should be properly remunerated."
"However we conceal overtime, we tolerate a situation in which one employee works from morning to night, while others have no chance of finding employment and become homeless."
"– Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank my colleague Mr Őry for his outstanding report – his first for this House, and one that persuades by its clear and penetrating depiction of the problems that exist in the new Member States."
"Congratulations, Csaba!"
"In the new Member States, around five million people are out of work, and the number is increasing, particularly among older people, women, single parents and workers without adequate skills."
"People with disabilities are marginalised; their chances of employment and of a secure income are diminishing constantly."
"My colleagues Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Libicki are quite right to point out that such situations also occur in the EU’s old Member States."
"It is apparent from analysis of the situation in the new Member States that the transition from an economy directed by the state to a social market economy makes major structural problems inevitable."
"There is work for all to do in ensuring that this problematic period is of only short duration."
"Unemployment and deficient education are among the major obstacles to inclusion in society."
"As the community of our Member States is founded upon social values, it must defuse this social timebomb."
"I agree with Mrs in 't Veld that job creation must have the highest priority; jobs, jobs, jobs, are what we urgently need."
"One way in which this may be accomplished is by decisive economic reforms that create favourable conditions for businesses."
"Financial incentives will have the same effect – tax breaks, wage cost subsidies and the cutting of social security contributions spring to mind."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are in particular need of support, as is the case in all our Member States; they are potential creators of jobs and apprenticeships, for every single one of which we have to fight, for they are urgently needed."
"The social partners have a crucial part to play in combating exclusion, supplementing the efforts of the public and private sectors, and dialogue between them must be stepped up."
"I see the foundation of trade unions and employers’ associations as a good idea, for both are needed."
"It is only when each has a large number of members that they will be enabled to take action, engage in dialogue and achieve a great deal."
"Exclusion is generally associated with inadequate education and training, and so these need to be improved, while, at the same, disadvantaged sections of the population need to be included."
"Let us use the experience we have already gained and involve businesses in this."
"The last point I would like to make is that the fight against social exclusion is made all the more effective the more the Member States and social partners share information – including both innovative and time-tested practices – with one another."
"Like our rapporteur, Mr Őry, I regard this as a priority objective."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hasse Ferreira, who is unable to be here today, and I, believe that effective action should be taken to promote jobs and fight social exclusion throughout the EU."
"If we are to combat poverty effectively, we must create more and better jobs, and the quality of those jobs must be seen as no less important."
"We wish to highlight the need to use incentives to encourage local organisations to support efforts to integrate more people into the labour market."
"This activity is important, because as well as contributing towards economic growth, it will also help to ensure that development is characterised by solidarity."
"In many Member States during the change of regimes and systems, labour rules and the nature of the labour market have also undergone significant change."
"Ladies and gentlemen, under a new social and political model, the fight against unemployment and for social inclusion also entail improving the quality of education and lifelong vocational training."
"Other important aspects of this debate are the notion that access to housing is a factor in social inclusion, and the need for effective support for bringing young people with degrees or other high-level qualifications into the labour market, in order to derive maximum benefit from the qualifications that they have acquired in the education system."
"Including young people in the manufacturing sector will also help to modernise the economy."
"Mr Hasse Ferreira and I would also like to highlight the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which urges Member States to attach special importance to eradicating poverty, which affects women, children and ethnic minorities in particular."
"In addition to attaching importance to competitiveness, the Lisbon Strategy also encompasses the European social model."
"In this context, the promotion of sustainable economic development, including the creation of more and better jobs, within the context of social cohesion, is key to ensuring that people of all States of the EU can be in a single market within a developed Europe that is characterised by solidarity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new Member States have undergone complex economic transformation over the last ten years, which has had a negative impact on various areas."
"The main factors contributing to social exclusion in many of the new EU Member States are high unemployment, almost no labour force mobility and problems relating to the social inclusion of people entering the labour market, women, older people, those suffering ill health, disabled persons and ethnic and linguistic minorities."
"Strong economic growth and more jobs are basic prerequisites for the permanent sustainability of social welfare systems."
"In order to boost such growth, I believe that the transitional measures in place on the labour market with regard to the new Member States must be abolished."
"No statistical backing has been found for the grounds upon which these measures, which are intended to protect the domestic labour markets of some of the 15 old EU Member States, were introduced."
"Education and vocational training systems that function effectively are further factors that boost growth."
"The number of people leaving education and vocational training early must be restricted, and it must be made easier to move from school to work, especially for those leaving school with low qualifications."
"Access to education must be improved for disadvantaged groups, and we must provide across-the-board support for life-long learning."
"A high-quality education system is one that is able to adapt effectively to conditions in a rapidly-changing labour market."
"The Member States adopted measures to deal with the problems of poverty and social exclusion in the shape of seven key political priorities."
"Together with the implementation of this report, these priorities should contribute to an increase in the supply of labour."
"An accessible, sustainable and high-quality healthcare system will contribute not only to the fight against disease and vulnerability to social exclusion, but also to the maintenance of a productive labour force."
"Implementation of the content of the report on social inclusion in the new Member States can help improve quality of life in the EU Member States."
"I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on his work."
". Mr President, I am impressed by the involvement of this House and I want to thank you for this important and stimulating debate."
"I feel that we share a common view on most of the problems you have raised."
"Poverty and social exclusion remain very urgent challenges for the whole Union."
"We have made significant, but not sufficient, progress since the Union’s social inclusion process was instituted following the Lisbon European Council in 2000."
"I can assure Mr Mann and Mrs in ‘t Veld that economic growth and jobs that promote social cohesion are among the priorities for Europe’s review of the Lisbon agenda."
"Furthermore, enlargement has increased the scale of the challenge."
"We have also been encouraged by the high level of commitment shown by the new Member States."
"The Commission fully shares the view that this process must be accelerated and is thus grateful to Parliament for the strong political support it has given to the Union’s social inclusion process."
"In reply to Mr Libicki, I should point out that from now on the new Member States will be fully integrated into the process."
"The current report relates to the period before the accession of the ten new members."
"Mr Őry and Mr Falbr highlighted the need for cooperation and partnership."
"I agree completely with this view."
"Member States are the key partners in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and their commitment to effective inclusion policies is a key factor for success."
"I equally share your view that the efforts of social partners and civil society are absolutely necessary in tackling the problem of poverty and social exclusion."
"Mrs Bauer rightly mentioned the poverty risk faced by women, in particular single mothers, and children."
"Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, as well as the Commission, strongly advocate the principle of gender mainstreaming, an approach which is very useful for addressing the specific problems of women, particularly as part of social inclusion policies."
"Hence I very much welcome the fact that many new Member States are already applying a gender mainstreaming strategy or including the gender dimension in some of their employment and social programmes."
"Even in those new Member States where this has not yet been achieved, the joint inclusion memoranda have highlighted the need to pay more attention in this respect."
"Child poverty is an EU-wide issue which touches the whole range of employment and social policies."
"It very often occurs when parents are unemployed or good quality jobs are lacking, or – as some Members rightly pointed out – it may result from the exclusion of particular groups, such as the Roma."
"The EU is fighting against this phenomenon via the European employment strategy, as well as through specific policies, and rightly so."
"The fight will go on."
". –I would just like to ask if there is any possibility – given that there are now so few of us left in the Chamber – of holding the vote on the report at the mini-plenary session scheduled to take place in two weeks time, rather than today?"
"– In that case, Mr Őry, it would be more appropriate to request an adjournment at voting time."
"Obviously, as I myself will be the President of the sitting then, I will not oppose it."
"I believe, however, that it is more appropriate to request an adjournment at voting time."
"– Mr President, with all due respect to my colleague Mr Őry, I wish to express my strong opposition to that."
"The item is on the agenda, and I think we should put it to the vote."
"Mr Posselt, I suggest that you give your opinion on the matter in due course."
"We will debate it at voting time, and, if there is a request for adjournment, it will be submitted to the Assembly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on Bolivia.(1)"
". – Mr President, Bolivia is regularly troubled by civil unrest and is currently ‘on the brink of civil war’, in the words of its President, Mr Carlos Mesa."
"Violent clashes between security forces and protestors, calling for economic reform and more rights for indigenous people, have been taking place in the streets of La Paz."
"The fear of escalating violence is growing by the day."
"Such clashes should come as no surprise to anybody, since the causal factors have been in place for a long time."
"First, there exists a huge and unjust discrepancy in wealth distribution."
"Secondly, the indigenous population, peasants, and the long queues of the unemployed are largely excluded from economic and political life."
"Thirdly, about 85% of farmland is owned by only 15% of the population, and fourthly, although Bolivia is thought to have the second largest gas reserves in South America, this natural resource is not sufficiently used for the benefit of the people of Bolivia and is to a large extent taken advantage of by foreign multinationals and a small group of elite beneficiaries."
"All the above, and much more, has led to the potentially explosive situation that we see today."
"The resolution before you mainly calls for continued efforts to deepen and broaden democracy in Bolivia and urges the EU and its Member States adequately to support the government to bring about a peaceful and just solution and avert a catastrophe of looming civil war."
"– Mr President, in accordance with this Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I believe that the initial proposer of this resolution, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, should speak first."
"– I am going to check this item of the Rules of Procedure, but, in the meantime, I will still give the floor to Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García."
". – Mr President, Bolivia is struggling between chaos and civil war."
"The collapse of the State institutions, the absence of authority and the disorder reigning in La Paz, in particular, make us fear the worst, if the worst has not already happened."
"But what has happened in Bolivia to bring the situation to such extremes?"
"There are many reasons: a succession of bad governments, the failure of fundamentalist neo-liberal policies, the despair of the impoverished masses excluded from the system, the predatory behaviour of the multinationals and — we must accept as well — the lack of understanding — or even worse, the indifference — of the international community."
"The truth is that, today, Bolivia is a failed, ungovernable and profoundly unstable State whose situation may get even worse, making any solution more difficult and more costly."
"I was in La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra just a month ago, sent by the Spanish Government to assess the situation and to propose possible initiatives."
"Having re-read the report that I wrote, I regret that things have evolved in the way I predicted, but I do not deserve credit for that, I was not being a visionary; it was already obvious, as it was two years previously, that Bolivia was heading for the abyss."
"On that visit, neither amongst the traditional parties nor the so-called ‘emerging parties’ nor amongst practically any of the political leaders did I find the least shred of a sense of direction for the State nor any lucid or generous analysis of what may be good for the country."
"All of them, or almost all of them, were calculating what was best for them personally: electing a constituent parliament, prefect elections in the nine departments of the country, a referendum on the emerging autonomous areas such as Santa Cruz de la Sierra ..."
"At that time I only came across one fundamental exception: the President himself, Carlos Mesa, whom I found to be a man with good intentions, who is trying to find solutions by means of dialogue and negotiation."
"But he was, and still is, a lone man, without a party, without parliamentary support, faced with a multifaceted opposition that were demanding contradictory solutions from him."
"At that point his only asset was high popularity and an unquestionable domination of television communications."
"Since he was willing — and he has stood by his word — not to put down demonstrations and street protests, the pickets of the most radical parties and unions took over the streets and forced him to resign."
"Furthermore, they have denied the Presidents of the Senate and of the Congress access to the presidency, though constitutionally they should be the successors to a resigned Mr Mesa, and have forced the President of the Supreme Court, the third in the order of succession, to become Head of State, but only so that general elections may be called in three months time."
"Paradoxically, Mr President, that may be the only and the best democratic solution."
"But not because of the demands and calculations of the most radical factions, not because that would give the citizens back their rightful role which has been seized from them in the street, because ‘the street ’ has been taken over by minority sectors that do not have the support of the immense majority of the 10 million people of Bolivia."
"What is the international community doing in the meantime?"
"Not much."
"The issue has therefore been raised in this Parliament: the European Union must be a global player; the European Union and its Member States are the main investors in development aid to Bolivia."
"Because we want governability and stability for Bolivia and because our interests are at stake, the Council must instruct its Ambassadors to ensure that Bolivia can find a peaceful, democratic and free solution."
"Never again must Bolivia's wealth, such as silver, rubber or wood, be channelled abroad or towards an internal élite, rather than being used for the benefit of the Bolivian people."
"– Before giving the floor to the next speaker, I am going to respond to our colleague, Mr Fernández Martín, who asked me to clarify an item of our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Fernández, when it is a case of speakers delivering a speech on behalf of their group, their order of speaking is decided on according to the size of the groups: hence, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and so on."
"When it is a case of giving the floor to authors or of debating resolutions, the sequence is decided on according to the chronological order in which the requests to speak have been submitted."
"It is therefore not a case of belonging to the largest group, but of being the quickest."
"To return to your question regarding Monday evening, the order of the three groups was: the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"The PPE was not on the podium."
"That being said, there will be no problem with you, in your turn, taking the floor."
"I would remind you that it is a practice that is as old as our Assembly."
". – Mr President, the current situation of tension and chaos in Bolivia was, I fear, to be expected."
"We have been aware for some time that broad sectors of civil society, in particular the indigenous people, peasants, workers and the unemployed, have been marginalised from the country's political and economic life."
"But we in Europe cannot act as if what is happening there had nothing to do with us."
"Twenty-six of the recently privatised companies are in foreign hands, many of them European, but that has not helped to resolve the crisis and has not given the population greater access to gas and water."
"The problem is that we in the European Union are constantly supporting privatisation processes in Latin America within international bodies, without any guarantees that the minimum principles of corporate social responsibility will be complied with."
"So what happens?"
"Companies receive credits, they invest, they want to make money, but when there are mobilisations by local groups that have been excluded or due to price rises resulting from privatisation, the European companies then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it, which aggravates the crisis even further."
"For these reasons, if the European Union wants to retain a degree of credibility as a supporter of human rights in the world, it must investigate the actions of energy companies of European origin in Bolivia and in other places, and must be much more demanding in terms of compliance with the social responsibility rules by companies investing abroad."
". – Mr President, we are alarmed by the situation in Bolivia, which is the result of poverty and enormous social inequality, yet we are opposed to any foreign interference or any attempt at a military coup."
"We are also alarmed at the attempts at separatism on the part of certain economic interests in Santa Cruz, which are seeking to monopolise the country’s energy resources."
"As such we hope that Bolivian society can reach a consensus whereby the management control of the country’s natural resources, especially the energy and water resources, can be returned to State hands and can contribute towards its development and towards the people’s well-being."
"We also hope that the ruling by the Constitutional Court can be implemented, which stated that certain energy conventions signed by the previous government with multinational companies were illegal, given that they had not been submitted for consultation to the Bolivian Parliament."
"Similarly, the perpetrators of the massacres of October 2003 must be brought to book and we urge the Organisation of American States to take precautionary measures on behalf of the leaders of the social movement who have been threatened, such as Evo Morales and Abel Mamami."
"Lastly we call on the Member States to take action within the international institutions, and at bilateral level, with a view to cancelling Bolivia’s foreign debt."
". – Mr President, we do not know what is happening right now in Bolivia, which is experiencing some of the most dramatic times in its history."
"The Governmental Palace, the home of the Presidency of the Republic, is known by the Bolivians as the ‘burnt palace’."
"It has been burnt down several times during the many popular uprisings in that country."
"Opposite the Palace, in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz, there is a bust of President General Gualberto Villarroel, who was murdered, hung from a lamppost, in 1943 during one of the many insurrections that have taken place there."
"Fortunately, according to the information I received just half an hour ago, the presidential palace has not so far suffered any damage and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to avoid bloodshed and civil war."
"I believe it is my duty to acknowledge, on behalf of my group, that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to put down protest movements and I regret that such an exceptional attitude, which is so unusual in a country with a history such as that of Bolivia, has not been reciprocated by the opposition leaders who, in my opinion, have been overcome by events and whose statements over recent hours have become more radical."
"At this moment, in Bolivia, power is in the streets."
"At a time when the legislators are meeting in Sucre, because it has not been possible to access the Congress building in the capital, La Paz, due to the blockades, the foreign embassies have mobilised their emergency plans for evacuating the country."
"Today, when we are getting ready to vote and to approve the resolution supporting the Bolivians and calling for respect and supporting the institutions and the constitutional laws, it only remains for me to call on God and on the Quechuan and Aymaran Gods to enlighten their leaders and to bless and protect the Bolivian people."
". – Mr President, Bolivia, of all countries, a country named after its liberator and first president Simon Bolivar, a man symbolic of Latin America as a whole, is in a state of ongoing crisis."
"Arriving in the La Paz basin, one is immediately struck by the glaring discrepancy between the beauty of the country and the incredible depression that hangs over the people."
"Someone once described Bolivia as ‘a beggar on a golden throne’, a throne at one time mainly founded upon ore, gold and other minerals, but now, increasingly, upon crude oil and natural gas."
"In view of the obvious risk that the country could become helpless in the hands of political and economic powers, we are of course obliged to do what we can to help keep it stable."
"Its neighbours include such major countries as Brazil, in respect of which my colleague Mr Deß has done such exemplary work by ensuring that measures are taken to ensure stability, particularly for agriculture, small-scale farmers and independent farms, along with the slow growth of a small business sector."
"This is the approach we must take in Bolivia too, or else the country faces the threat of disintegration, with all the resultant consequences for the political map of Latin America."
"It is for that reason that we must work with all the means at our disposal towards a peaceful transition by way of new elections monitored by the international community, but above all towards the country’s speedier recovery, which will involve strengthening small farmers and small and medium-sized businesses, failing which the country, long at the mercy of conglomerates and conspiracies, risks generating conflicts that would suck its neighbours, including Brazil – particularly its Mato Grosso state – into their maelstrom."
"It is for that reason that this House needs to finalise a strategy for Latin America."
"Our Christian Europe forged the two continents of North and South America; there may one day be a bitter price to pay for our present neglect of the latter."
". Mr President, the European Commission is extremely concerned about the critical political situation in Bolivia."
"We are following the situation very closely."
"Many countries in the Andean region have faced serious political and institutional crises in recent years, but events in Bolivia have shown it to be a particularly fragile and vulnerable state, not least because it is one of the poorest, least-developed and most unequal South American countries."
"The current increasingly anarchic climate, which culminated in Monday evening’s resignation of President Carlos Mesa, is deeply worrying."
"At this delicate moment the Commission urges all Bolivian citizens, rich and poor, of all ethnic origins and from all regions of the country, to pursue their respective demands and aspirations peacefully, by means of dialogue, within the framework of democracy and the rule of law and in accordance with the constitution."
"Whilst we are relieved to note that up to now, as far as we are informed, there have been few injuries during the recent unrest, it is now absolutely vital that Bolivia’s political leaders and civil society work together to extricate their country from its current difficulties in a spirit of peace, dialogue, tolerance and national reconciliation."
"The histories of both Europe and Latin America show that violence or non-democratic solutions do nothing to bring lasting peace or prosperity to their citizens."
"Their heartfelt but often conflicting demands and aspirations can only be tackled successfully by working together to generate consensus and unity."
"In that regard, the Commission hopes that the efforts of the Catholic church to organise a national dialogue and ensure a smooth constitutional succession will continue and will be successful."
"The Commission has been making a real and practical contribution to supporting dialogue in Bolivia by using our rapid reaction mechanism to provide up to EUR 185 000 to the Club of Madrid to implement a six-month programme of high-level consultancy and support for consensus building and strengthening of leadership skills, which started in mid-April and will continue in the run-up to the long-awaited constituent assembly."
"The Commission and the Council have also worked in close collaboration to prepare an EU action plan for Bolivia, which was adopted in mid-May."
"It provides a framework for coherent and structured common action by EU institutions and by the Member States jointly and individually."
"The action includes engaging in constructive political dialogue, providing support for the constituent assembly, respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, exchanges of experience with different models of regional autonomy and providing constructive input and the benefit of EU experience in securing the benefits of foreign investment for all Bolivians."
"Bolivia has also been included in the list of eligible countries for the European initiative on democracy and human rights for 2005-2006."
"In the Bolivian context, projects related to training, monitoring and consciousness-raising in the fields of democracy and human rights, projects that promote the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples and projects that support the role of civil society in conflict prevention are all eligible for support."
"There is, unfortunately, only limited scope for such support to be implemented while Bolivia is gripped by its present crisis."
"The Commission welcomes the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament, which would underline the need for full respect for democracy and the rule of law and would add a further very important EU voice to the calls for dialogue."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place presently, at the end of the debates."
"– The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on freedom of the press in Algeria.(1)"
". – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the secretariat of the ALDE Group, to which I belong, for submitting the application so quickly and thus giving me the privilege of being the first to speak in this debate."
"In Algeria, President Bouteflika’s Government continues, through judicial procedures lacking in any credibility, independence or justification, in its attempt to silence journalists who are considered by the governing regime to offend or attack the President or the government."
"In fact, these so-called attacks are no more than the ordinary independent criticisms by political journalists we see on a daily basis in all free democratic countries."
"As a result of this war on the free press, numerous journalists are being dragged before the courts and many have been imprisoned or savagely fined."
"The list is long and the cases of the editor of the daily newspaper , Mr Fouad Boughanem, and the cartoonist, Mr Hakim Laâlam, who were sentenced by a court in Algiers to two months in prison and fined 250 000 dinars for defamation, are recent examples."
"As indeed is the case of publisher Mohammed Benchicou, already in prison for libel offences, whose transfer to hospital for much needed treatment – requested by the prison doctor – the courts have refused to approve, even on humanitarian grounds."
"We call upon the Algerian Government to respect the principle of freedom of speech and to stop harassing journalists in an attempt to silence the voices of the democratisation process and the opposition press."
". – There is nothing new about problems relating to freedom of the press in Algeria."
"Since the early 1990s, journalists and intellectuals in the country have suffered constant pressure, attacks and arrests."
"I need only mention the fact that around 60 journalists were murdered during the civil war of the 1990s."
"At present, the main problem is that the Algerian state authorities are openly hostile to the private press, and the international community must respond to this threat."
"A number of Algerian publications are the target of frequent and routine persecution."
"Official censorship is imposed, and the state is the sole owner of the printing houses."
"Publishers are constantly in debt to the latter, which means that the state gains even greater control over both the press and the media market as a whole."
"Journalists face huge problems, as it is inordinately difficult for them to work under such conditions."
"They have no official status, no employment contracts and no regular wages, and in practice their trade union is not yet worthy of the name."
"Lawsuits against many journalists are in progress, while a great many others have already been sentenced to prison."
"It is not hard for the authorities to put pressure on the press and to control and curtail its freedom under such circumstances, and yet the press is a key source of information and a powerful tool for shaping public opinion."
"In order to promote democracy and respect for fundamental civil liberties in Algeria, which after all is one of the EU’s neighbours, we should take firm action to boost the status of the independent media and to foster the provision of information that is both pluralistic and diverse."
"I would call for the EU to give priority to freedom of the press, the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights in Algeria when pursuing its neighbourhood policy in the Mediterranean region."
". – Mr President, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are one of the foundations upon which any democracy that wishes to respect human rights must be based."
"It is for this reason that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights supports the development of pluralist media and the strengthening of independent media, including in Algeria, and it must continue to do so."
"In this regard, I must say that I am worried about the current situation of the free press in Algeria, particularly following the reform of the Penal Code adopted in 2001 and, specifically, the provisions laying down long prison sentences for defamation."
"It would therefore be an excellent gesture on the part of the Algerian authorities, within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean neighbourhood policy and the Association Agreement, to release the journalists convicted of defamation without delay, to lift the state of emergency and to cease persecuting the Algerian private media."
"All of this would contribute enormously to developing and strengthening the rule of law and conforming to the provisions of Article 2 of the Association Agreement."
". – The Republic of Algeria is a very important partner for the European Union Member States."
"Wide-ranging economic interests are involved, and not only for France."
"Millions of people come from there to work in the European Union."
"There have always been several linguistic and cultural groups in the country, but alongside this wealth of languages and cultures there is still a sharp divide between the purely Islamist, hard-line Arab and quasi-European approaches, particularly since independence was gained."
"The European approach is connected with the use of French as a second official language in public life and in schools."
"Unfortunately, it must be taken on board that the Arab approach is often associated with suppressing traditional democratic freedoms."
"The question now is how democratic tendencies can be supported in Algeria."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before voting on the report I would ask you to give priority to promoting democracy."
"From what I know of everyday life in the Czech Republic, a country where over 80% of the press is in the hands of two foreign owners from one of its neighbouring countries, I can say that, in certain circumstances, press freedom is crucial for countries."
"The Confederal Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance naturally supports the motion for a resolution."
". – Mr President, Algeria’s history has not made it an ideal breeding ground for democracy, human rights and a free press."
"The country was liberated after a very violent war of independence against the French colonial power, which lasted for many years, only for its budding democracy to be toppled by Boumedienne’s ."
"After years of stagnation that resulted from that, elections were called; had they not been cancelled, they would have been won by Islamic fundamentalists."
"Since then, the country has been ruled by the military and bureaucrats who combine their fear of fundamentalism with an Arabic nationalism that is hostile to the Berber minority and turns its back on 130 years of French cultural influence."
"The Neighbourhood Policy that the European Union intends to develop cannot be indifferent."
"It would be a big mistake if we turned a blind eye to such fundamental rights as the freedom of expression of opinion and information."
"At the next exchange with the Algerian parliament, we must at least bring up the measures against newspapers and journalists."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will rate human rights more important than gas supplies and other economic interests."
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and the international community on democracy in Algeria."
"With the assistance of our delegation in Algiers, we are following events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, media and freedom of the press."
"All these issues must be seen against the background of a political dialogue with Algeria that has been relatively neglected in the past."
"So far, in the absence of a legal framework, the Commission has had somewhat limited scope for raising these issues with the Algerian authorities."
"Even under those circumstances, however, in bilateral encounters with Algerian official counterparts or at EuroMed ministerial meetings, the Commission has always urged respect for fundamental values such as democracy, observance of human rights and the rule of law."
"As you know, the EU-Algeria Association Agreement has recently been ratified by all EU and Algerian partners."
"It is expected to enter into force on 1 September 2005."
"The ratification of the Association Agreement has created political momentum for a renewed political dialogue on all sensitive matters, including those related to the enforcement of Article 2 of the Agreement regarding the promotion of democracy and the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms."
"The first Association Council should meet by the end of the year, under the UK presidency."
"On that occasion, the Commission will wish to establish links and contacts with its Algerian counterparts with a view to working on key issues relating to the implementation of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation."
"Once the key issues and links have been established, we intend to set up technical subcommittees as quickly as possible to implement the most important aspects of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation."
"Once Algeria is ready to enter a new phase in the reinforcement of its bilateral dialogue with its European partners, this preparatory work will be the basis for finalisation of a joint European neighbourhood policy action plan, in which issues such as human rights, democratisation, political and institutional reform will feature prominently."
"In the meantime, the Commission will use all the means at its disposal to pursue a constructive dialogue with Algeria on those issues and will continue to encourage the Algerian authorities to abandon their attempt to criminalise defamation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place presently, at the end of the debates."
"– The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on Azerbaijan.(1)"
". – Mr President, the Government of Azerbaijan is continuing its crackdown on opposition political groups."
"On 21 May, the police and paramilitary forces beat up and arrested participants in a peaceful opposition rally in Baku."
"The official excuse was that permission to hold the rally was denied and this despite an apparent order of 12 May from President Aliyev, instructing government authorities to respect freedom of assembly."
"Dozens of civilians were arrested in that incident and many journalists were beaten up by the police."
"It is worth noting that the purpose of the rally was to voice the need for amendments to Azerbaijan’s election laws, in order to prevent the authorities from falsifying election results, to ask for the creation of an independent public broadcasting authority, and to demand the prosecution of the murderer of the independent journalist Elmar Huseynov, who was shot dead outside his apartment last month."
"In other police operations, scores of known opposition activists, including the heads of youth organisations, were rounded up and mistreated."
"Parliamentary elections are due in November and it seems that a repeat pattern of violence instigated and carried out by the State is starting again, as it did before the 2003 elections."
"We call on the Government of Azerbaijan, and in particular President Aliyev, to proceed quickly with the necessary electoral reforms and to show the necessary respect for its citizens’ right to free, fair and democratic elections."
". – Mr President, I do not want to say very much about this report other than to echo some of the remarks that have been made by the rapporteur."
"Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the South Caucasus countries have clearly been through a very difficult period and some of them are making better progress than others."
"I think we all want to see the human rights situation improved."
"There are a number of internal conflict situations that are causing considerable concern and I think that we in this Parliament should be adding our support to the President and to the authorities in Azerbaijan."
"My Group will be supporting the first, but not the second, part of the Verts/Ale Group amendment after recital J. However, I urge all colleagues to give their support to this resolution and we should do what we can to assist the people of Azerbaijan."
". – Mr President, for 15 years, the collapse of the Soviet Union has resulted in major changes in Central Europe, while in the east, the authoritarian forms of government have remained virtually intact."
"They have carried out privatisations and major cuts in the public sector, resulting in a large group of new poor people."
"This led to anything but European-style parliamentary democracies."
"The one-party states were replaced by small dictatorial profiteering cliques regarding themselves as answerable to nothing and nobody."
"In Ukraine and Georgia, popular movements against such authoritarian leaders received support from the West, and rightly so."
"In Belarus too, where such a revolution has not yet been successful, the opposition, though weak, can count on much external sympathy."
"This is in contrast to former Soviet Republics, including Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, where America has now gained major military and economic footholds, but where there has, to date, been no such external support for popular uprisings."
"The regimes’ opponents risk jail or the death penalty, and there is no chance of free elections."
"In the coming weeks and months, Europe will need to manifest consistent solidarity with the opposition movements that focus their efforts on democratisation from the inside."
". – Mr President, Azerbaijan became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but has lost 16% of its previous territory in a short-lived war over the ethnic Armenian territory of Ngorno Karabakh with neighbouring Armenia and must now support some 570 000 internally-displaced persons."
"Corruption is endemic in Azerbaijan and the promise of wealth from its oil reserves is, as yet, unrealised."
"It suffers from terrible ecological problems in the Caspian Sea as a result of DDT and toxic defoliants used in cotton farming."
"It enjoys close military and political links with Turkey, and the EU has strong interests in securing the energy corridor that supplies Western countries with its oil and gas, and also maintaining Azeri cooperation in the fight against international terrorism in the face of recent allegations from Russian sources that Azerbaijan has supported Chechen separatists."
"President Aliyev was elected in October 2003 in a contested and deeply-flawed election condemned by international observers."
"But Azerbaijan’s President has committed himself now to holding free and fair parliamentary elections this November."
"The 4 June opposition rally went peacefully, as just two weeks previously police had beaten back opposition protestors who tried to hold a rally in Baku despite an official ban, and dozens were arrested."
"The final decision regarding the location of the rally was taken after negotiations between the Baku mayor and opposition leaders, who have now warned of dire consequences if falsification is used again in the November elections."
"Some observers even predict that Azerbaijan will eventually see an uprising similar to those that occurred in the toppled regimes of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan."
"The recent unsolved murder of editor-in-chief, Elmar Huseynov, has raised accusations of government involvement and a relative of the exiled former speaker and opposition figure, Rasul Gouliev, the UK citizen Almaz Gouliev, has been arrested on the allegedly trumped-up charge of a pistol being found in her bag, apparently in order to deter Mr Gouliev from returning for the elections."
"Azerbaijan is clearly far from being a model democratic and stable Council of Europe state and the EU must now do everything possible to promote democracy and human rights there."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the internal situation in Azerbaijan is highly explosive and deserves our attention."
"The main reason is the growing dissatisfaction, not to mention downright disillusion, with President Aliyev’s authoritarian regime."
"Worryingly, this popular discontent is finding an increasingly Islamic expression."
"Suffice to say that at the moment, 20% of Azerbaijanis favour the introduction of , the Islamic law, and Azerbaijan does not have a Western outlook either."
"This significant internal dissatisfaction can be attributed to several causes."
"For example, the true unemployment rate, despite the oil and construction boom, is very high, being estimated at 20% to 30%."
"Furthermore, the current presidential government owes its dire popularity ratings to its practice of silencing the opposition in the electronic media, obstructing, where possible, the opposition’s public manifestations, and to a hardly representative voting system characterised by ballot-rigging."
"The latter is, in fact, a national tradition, which is taking on ever more refined forms these days."
"Can the European Union, as one of Baku’s official partners, do anything at all to help Azerbaijan develop peacefully and democratically?"
"What is called for in any event is clear language from Brussels about how reprehensible its government’s repressive practices are, as is close, European observation of the ballots in the parliamentary elections planned for November."
"I hope that the Council and Commission will be firm in calling President Aliyev and his political entourage to account about the enormous political risks of repressive policy not merely in a national, but also in a much larger, regional, context."
". – Mr President, no political transition is easy."
"It is no doubt even more difficult for some of the former autonomous republics of the Soviet Empire: the conflicts taking place at the moment in the three countries of the South Caucasus are largely due to the ghastly legacy of Stalin who, in his ‘divide and rule’ strategy, had reattached Ngorno Karabakh to Azerbaijan."
"Today, the deadlock over Ngorno Karabakh is one of the main reasons for the stagnation of the region."
"As long as it remains unresolved, no prospect of development can be hoped for in that region, which is, however, a natural bridge between the European Union and Asia."
"Azerbaijan’s difficult economic, social and political situation is a direct outcome of this tense status quo, if only as a result of the large number of refugees and of displaced persons from within the country itself, who are a heavy burden on the country."
"Whilst there are renewed hopes of an improvement in the overall situation in the country, thanks to the opening of the Baku–Tbilissi–Ceyhan pipeline and the dividends accrued from extracting oil from the Caspian Sea, that in no way excuses the repressive attitude of the authorities towards the opposition."
"Azerbaijan voluntarily made the decision to turn towards Europe by requesting accession to the Council of Europe."
"Europe laid down the rules of democracy for guidance."
"By first of all signing an initial Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 1999 and by integrating it in its new Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union then indicated its willingness to support Azerbaijan in its democratic process."
"Today, the Union has a right to expect progress along those lines."
"Whilst there is reason to be very pleased about the release of political prisoners and the presidential decree calling for international laws to be enforced with regard to respect for citizens’ democratic rights, the events that took place in Baku in May – the ban on meetings held by opposition parties and the arrest and imprisonment of opposition activists – are not acceptable."
"In view of the fact that we wish above all to support our friends in the South Caucasus, in general, and in Azerbaijan, in particular, we call on President Aliyev and his Government to make every effort to ensure that the forthcoming legislative elections in November 2005 are conducted in a legitimate and transparent manner and that the opposition candidates can freely conduct their campaigns, in complete safety and with fair access to the media."
"That will be a powerful token of the government’s willingness to make a more in-depth commitment to the road to democracy, to which it had made an official commitment during the meeting with our parliamentary delegation."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, Azerbaijan is one of our partners in accordance with Europe’s neighbourhood policy, into which it was incorporated at this House’s insistence, even though – in common with all the other republics in the Southern Caucasus – it had not formed part of the first round."
"In Azerbaijan, then, we have a relatively demanding programme; it is on the basis of our principles, our values and our rule of law that the Azerbaijani state, too, is to act."
"The country report that the Commission has drawn up, which is intended to result, over the coming months, in plans of action, offers us the opportunity to give a shot in the arm to the process of democratisation and establishing the rule of law."
"While not using the same language in every instance, we should weigh our words when articulating criticisms and denounce really serious human rights violations for what they are."
"Nothing of what I have just heard from my fellow Members about the increasing number of arrests, about the absence of free elections – as Mr Meijer said – or the introduction of sharia law in Azerbaijan, which really is a tragedy – gets to grips with the reality of what is going on there."
"We have to bear in mind in which region the country is situated."
"This week, we have been discussing Uzbekistan, a country where the government had between 400 and 500 civilians shot for going on a demonstration, and here we are talking about what happened on 21 May, when a few demonstrators were arrested and then released after a few hours, and then on 4 June, when the government gave permission for a demonstration by the opposition."
"That may well be nowhere near our idea of what democracy and the rule of law are like, but I think we have to bear these things in mind in our assessment of these events and in the language we choose when describing them."
"It is indeed the case that we have to observe these elections."
"They are due to be held in November, and the European institutions must not make the same mistake that they did in Ukraine, where we did not at first take the elections at all seriously and did not follow their progress."
"Mr Solana, the High Representative, woke up to the situation only when the Ukrainian people took to the streets to demonstrate against the electoral fraud that had been going on."
"It follows that we in this House should, over the coming weeks and months, keep an eye on how this process progresses."
"We should send a delegation of observers and make use of the action plans now coming into force as a means of helping a country that is in a very difficult region, and parts of which are under occupation, yet which is determined to move towards democracy and towards becoming a good European neighbour."
"In so doing, we will be serving our own European interests, as well as democracy and the rule of law and human rights, better than if we were simply, with words of harsh criticism, to lay into countries with whose circumstances we are insufficiently familiar."
". – Mr President, I echo the fine speech of my Group colleague, Mrs Isler Béguin, in stressing how important the timing of this resolution is to Azerbaijan as it faces elections."
"I visited the region last month with Scottish Parliament colleagues, because we are keen to reach out to these countries with our experience of social democratic and civic nationalism."
"In that region, the events in one country all too often have serious ramifications in another."
"In that vein, I would commend to you in particular paragraph 10 of the resolution and the reference to the fragile civil society in Azerbaijan, because that is the key to a long-term solution for the region’s problems."
"It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan, Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs, but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help, inspiration and perhaps even leadership."
"I hope this resolution will give an added impetus to the Union’s dealings with this troubled region and the positive experience that we can bring to its future."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, whenever I hear the name of the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan, I think of enormous oil wealth and a presidential regime that is tough in comparison with the democracies in the rest of Europe;"
"I also think of problems with neighbouring countries, in particular the conflict in Nagorny Karabakh."
"The country’s huge wealth is in stark contrast to the growing poverty among its population."
"As mentioned by one of the previous speakers, those currently living as refugees still have no home, in contrast to the situation in Armenia, for example."
"The logical result of this social tension is the undemocratic measures taken by the government that are criticised in the resolution under debate."
"Of course, the aspect of the political system that has been the target of harsh criticism is the fact that it is possible to arrest large numbers of people for having participated in demonstrations or unrest, without any clear individual charges."
"That they were released is another matter."
"Journalists and opposition politicians were present among those arrested, and this is something that must be roundly rejected anywhere in the world."
"Releasing them, however, does not solve the problem, in particular when the country in question is a member state of the Council of Europe."
"We should support the development of common democratic values in this Caucasian republic, and not allow the mediaeval Islamist forces to be given the green light."
". – Today we are discussing violations of human rights and democracy in Azerbaijan."
"This country is the latest in a series of Soviet republics to fight for independence, following Georgia and Ukraine."
"At least several dozen protesters calling for democratic reforms in the country were arrested during the recent demonstration in Baku."
"Even prior to this, over 100 people had been sentenced to prison for expressing their political opinions and opposing the government, following the rigged presidential elections of 2003."
"A great many opposition activists, journalists, teachers and casual bystanders have been caught up in the wave of violence unleashed by the authorities."
"Azerbaijan is turning out to be a typical example of a country that has undergone superficial transformations."
"Its much-trumpeted democracy is nothing other than a facade behind which the totalitarian leaders of the Communist party have exchanged their party membership books for cheque books."
"They have amassed fortunes at the expense of society by manipulating people who have been deprived not only of their rights, but also of their property."
"As Pope John Paul II once said, the warped idea of freedom as entirely unencumbered liberty and licence still poses a threat to democracy and free societies."
"We are in favour of justice and truth, so we support the opposition’s demands that democratic principles and freedom of speech be respected and that there be no more intimidation or violence."
"We also support their calls for the punishment of those who murdered Mr Huseynov and Mr Djalilov, those members of the opposition who died in unexplained circumstances."
"– Mr President, will Azerbaijan follow in the footsteps of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan?"
"If only it could!"
"The situation in this country is worrying."
"Not long ago a leader of the democratic opposition died in mysterious circumstances, following the death of another opposition leader earlier this year."
"At the same time, however, even tragedies of this kind and other forms of persecution, such as the arrest of 29 opposition activists in mid-May, do not alter the course of history and cannot reverse its tide."
"The 70 000-strong crowd of demonstrators last Saturday in Baku was well aware of this fact."
"The fight for democracy in Azerbaijan is also a fight for stability, of which there is an urgent need in the country."
"To put it bluntly, Azerbaijan is a major centre of Caspian Sea oil production, particularly since the opening of the USD 4 billion pipeline between Baku, Tbilisi and Ceyhan in Turkey, which will reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil."
"The pipeline’s target capacity is one million barrels of oil per day."
"Five days ago, following the recent demonstration, the leader of the opposition party Musavat said that Azerbaijan deserved democracy and was out to get it."
"He was speaking the truth, and the European Parliament should help ensure that this is what happens."
"– Mr President, the opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline has ushered in a new era for Azerbaijan."
"However, the new economic challenges which are arising must be followed by a series of reforms at political and social level."
"Otherwise, they will lead the country to results which are the opposite of those anticipated, such as even greater unemployment and a wider social gap."
"Azerbaijan must make good use of these developments and move towards democratisation."
"We urge the Azeri Government in the motion for a resolution to respect democratic values, including the right to a different opinion, and to start an open dialogue with the opposition, in accordance with the undertakings which it has given within the framework of the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"A political environment needs to be created which will foster political pluralism, in order to ensure that the elections next November are conducted democratically."
"We roundly condemn the murder of the journalist Elmar Huseynov, the ban on rallies, such as the recent rally cancelled by the Mayor of Baku on 21 May, and the cases of infringement of judicial independence, and we call on the country to dynamically promote institutional, legal and administrative reform."
"It must be made clear to the present Azeri Government that the European Union roundly condemns all forms of antidemocratic practice."
"I call on the House to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution which we are debating today and I express the hope that our intervention will be taken into serious account by the Azeri Government."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Laschet, opposition by three right-wing parties – three nationalist parties – has been suppressed in Azerbaijan, in advance of the opening of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline."
"The mass arrests have, in fact, deprived of their leadership the political opposition and the local human rights watch organisations challenging the patently fraudulent election."
"It is the usual story of the US sheriff controlling oil resources around the world."
"Wherever US soldiers do not move in, as they have done in Iraq, their political mercenaries move in: this is what is happening in Colombia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Madagascar."
"It is an operation begun immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union."
"In order to safeguard its interests, the United States supplies millions of dollars in weapons and dispatches military advisers to the whole of the Caucasus region."
"By condemning the Azeri regime, the European Union is in fact condemning the US policy of exploitation."
"In order to protect human rights and democracy, we have to challenge US policy and interests."
". Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and the international community on human rights and democratisation in Azerbaijan."
"We are following the events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, the media and the right of expression and assembly."
"We are also closely monitoring preparations for the November 2005 parliamentary elections and urging the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that they are conducted in full compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections."
"Some Members have asked if we should send a team of observers to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan."
"In line with standard practice in the OSCE region, a European Union election observation mission will not be deployed for the elections in Azerbaijan."
"Instead, support will be given to the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission that is to be deployed."
"The Commission will also consider whether, in line with recent actions and in connection with the elections in Ukraine, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, financial support can be provided to the OSCE/ODIHR fund in order to widen participation in election observation missions, to enable more observers from central, eastern, south-eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to participate."
"All these issues and activities must be seen against the background of Azerbaijan’s inclusion in the European Neighbourhood Policy, as decided by the Council in June 2004."
"At its meetings with the Azerbaijani authorities, the Commission has always stressed that the European Neighbourhood Policy necessarily implies sharing fundamental values such as democracy, respect of human rights and the holding of genuinely democratic elections."
"As you know, on 25 April 2005 the General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to offer Azerbaijan the opportunity to develop an ENP Action Plan with the European Union and I hope that will be finalised before the end of this year."
"Human rights, fundamental freedoms, genuinely democratic elections and democratisation will be amongst the main priorities of this document, which will provide overall guidance for future relations between Azerbaijan and the European Union."
"Moreover, the Commission is assisting Azerbaijan with its institutional, legal and administrative reforms through the TACIS programme."
"This whole range of issues is one of the two main priorities chosen for the TACIS National Action Programme 2004-2005."
"Last but not least, the Commission is also providing financial support through its European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"Five regional projects are currently being funded in the southern Caucasus for a total amount of over EUR 5 million."
"The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to pursue effective protection of human rights in Azerbaijan and to make sure that the democratisation of the country progresses smoothly in the near future."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a moment."
"The next item is voting time."
". The reason why I voted in favour of the Öry report is its topicality regarding the issue of social inclusion in the 10 new Member States."
"The rapporteur has given a detailed account of the basic challenges faced by the new Member States in fighting poverty and social exclusion."
"It was mostly MEPs from the new Member States who presented arguments highlighting the seriousness of this topic during the debate."
"Their speeches centred on the theme of poverty, which also involves the social inclusion of children, or in other words has an impact on the prospects of the new generation."
"By way of example, statistics indicate that in my country, Slovakia, as many as 21% of citizens live below the poverty threshold, mostly in less-developed regions of the country."
"This report provides a basis for addressing the tremendous challenge faced by the EU in achieving the ambitious Lisbon goals of employment growth, social cohesion and sustainable development."
"The EU’s progress will depend on its approach to the fundamental rights of the EU citizens who are most at risk, and who mainly live in the 10 new Member States."
"This approach should be guided by social inclusion and the fight against all forms of discrimination."
"One report is on employment and productivity and their contribution to economic growth, and the other is on social inclusion in the new Member States."
"Both reports contain general recommendations on how the EU Member States should conduct their economic policy."
"Even though we are able substantially to support quite a few of the proposals, it is not for the EU to lay down such policy."
"Through institutional competition, countries should of their own accord find suitable solutions as to the way in which economic policy is to be shaped."
"Those countries that introduced transitional rules governing labour mobility in connection with the ten new Member States should be entitled to retain these."
"It is a good idea, however, to revise the rules because the problems arising from the free migration of labour from the new EU countries have been dramatically exaggerated."
"For the above-noted reasons, we are voting against both reports."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 9 June 2005."
"Before proceeding to the approval of the amendments to the order of business that have been presented, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the Conference of Presidents."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 65 years ago today, in June 1940, three countries which are now members of the European Union — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — lost their independence as a result of the Soviet occupation."
"As a result of this and for half a century, the citizens of those countries were deprived of their human rights and suffered terror and deportations."
"Today our institution is remembering these events, which, together with others, are part of our history."
"This is not the first time that the European Parliament has talked about this, it is not the first time that this Parliament has remembered the past of these countries, which today are members of the European Union."
"In 1983, 22 years ago now, this Parliament expressed its condemnation of the occupation of States by other States."
"And at these difficult times for the European Union, right now, we must remember that the accession of those Baltic states to the Union has contributed and will continue to contribute to promoting the objectives of freedom and prosperity for the citizens."
"Today we must express our pride in the fact that we can work together on the construction of a united Europe that shares common values."
"It is important to remember this, it is important to remember that the construction of a better future for all Europeans is based on respect for human rights and requires constant attention and vigilance, because people who forget their history run the risk of repeating it."
"Thank you very much."
"With the agreement of the political groups, I propose the following amendments to the order of business for the present part-session which appear in the corrigendum that has been distributed."
"The report by Mr Gargani on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament will be dealt with immediately after the joint debate on the European Council and the work of the Luxembourg Presidency, during which the President-in-Office of the Council and Mr Barroso will speak."
"The report by Mr Cashman on the Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders is included following the report by Mr Gargani and will be put to the vote tomorrow without amendments."
"The recommendation for second reading by Othmar Karas on the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies was approved on 20 June."
"This item will be included at the end of today’s agenda."
"The time limit for the presentation of amendments or for rejection of the common position will end this afternoon at 4.00 p.m."
"With regard to the votes, the report by Mr Barón Crespo on the protection of occupiers of vehicles in the event of collisions is withdrawn from the agenda, but we are adding two other items: the two reports by Mr Cavada on Sudan and the Congo, approved in accordance with Rule 131, and the report by Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen on draft amending budget 2/2005."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Hans-Peter Martin would like to make a comment."
"Mr President, I rise, as announced, pursuant to Rule 132 of the Rules of Procedure, in order to call upon you to remove from the agenda the debate on the Members’ Statute, or to stop it going ahead."
"The vote on it is not even announced in tomorrow’s agenda."
"There has already been one irregular vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and, at a time when the EU is in the midst of its direst crisis, it would send completely the wrong message if we were to adopt a Members’ Statute while accumulating privileges on the quiet."
"That is no way to treat a democratic people’s Chamber."
"I therefore call upon you to avail yourself of Rule 132(2) and take appropriate precautions, so that Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, can talk about a programme of savings without being compromised by this House adopting a new package of privileges at the same time."
"Having studied paragraph 2 of Rule 132 with the assistance and advice of the services of the House, I can see no reason to grant your request."
"The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement – European Council meeting (Brussels, 16-17 June 2005) and the Council statement – Work of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Both items will be debated jointly."
"To this end, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, will take the floor first."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency is drawing to an end."
"Some will say ‘thank goodness’, but personally I am sorry it is ending and I should have liked to continue."
"The time has come to assess the results."
"A number of observations can be made which I hope are undisputed."
"Firstly, we succeeded in leading the European Council or Council of Ministers to take a number of decisions in sectors which, at the start of the year, were acutely controversial."
"We reformed the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby ending a long period of uncertainty which had the potential to trigger a profound rift among the euro-zone Member States."
"Far from eliminating stability, we have added stability to the preventive aspects of the Pact."
"Nor have we introduced excessive flexibility as regards the Pact’s corrective role, but instead have made it read and feel more economic than automatic."
"As President of the Eurogroup, I shall work to ensure proper application and judicious interpretation of the Pact which, in future, will pay greater heed to its two equally vital dimensions, namely stability, combined with growth, and growth allied to stability."
"Secondly, Parliament, the Commission and Council have been successful in giving fresh impetus to the Lisbon strategy."
"Reinforced competitiveness, increasing modernisation in both our attitudes and our economic policies, a renewed determination to innovate and do more in the field of research – these are the major planks of the new strategy, which neither created nor sought deadlock, as some people may initially have wished, either in the area of social cohesion – which has been restored as a major objective, one of the key aims of the European Union – or that of an appropriate environmental policy – which is emphatically not a threat to jobs and competitiveness."
"Hello."
"I know people often react to my speeches. The reaction is not usually quite so immediate."
"To come back to the Lisbon strategy: we are changing the way it is applied."
"Member States, through national reform programmes, will take greater ownership of the strategy and thus become answerable to their national parliaments in the best national tradition of European texts and European commitment."
"The June European Council, held last Thursday and Friday, for the first time in its history approved integrated guidelines, an important event which, alas, has passed virtually unnoticed in the last few days."
"To those seeking to modernise the European Union, while giving the impression that others are opposed to modernisation, to those who want to respond to the new challenges facing the European Union while giving the impression that everyone else is unaware of those challenges, I would say: ‘Read your own decisions and apply them, instead of calling for new ones’."
"Thirdly, Mr President, we successfully set new targets for public development aid on a European Union level."
"After confirming that the European cooperation effort has to be stepped up to 0.70% of our national wealth by 2015, we set an intermediate goal for the European Union of 0.56% of national wealth by 2010."
"I take a degree of pride in that decision, because I knew at the beginning of the year that it was a vexed and controversial one."
"That decision, that advance will increase the level of aid from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to EUR 66 billion by 2010; an increasing contribution, therefore, each year, and, from 2010, an extra EUR 20 billion per annum."
"It is not perfect, but it is a significant step."
"Other parts of the world just as wealthy as the Union would do well to take their cue from us to help eradicate poverty, the true scourge of modern times."
"Having successfully banished slavery in the 19th century, we must be able to eliminate poverty during the first half of the 21st century."
"Fourthly and lastly, Mr President, as promised on 12 January when I presented the programme for the Luxembourg Presidency, we have improved our relations with our US partner."
"This was clear at the meeting on 22 February 2005 here in Brussels with President Bush, who had expressed a desire to come over to Europe."
"It was also clear during Monday’s summit between President Barroso and President Bush."
"I would also mention that on Sunday we had another summit – this time with Canada."
"We do not devote enough attention to Canada, an important ally for the European Union."
"Canada is also part of North America."
"To come back to Monday’s summit: we confirmed the vital need for both Europe and the USA to stand shoulder to shoulder on the basis of shared convictions."
"Today, a conference on Iraq is being held in Brussels, as we proposed to President Bush at our meeting on 22 February."
"The European Union and the United States jointly organising and co-chairing a conference on Iraq: who would have believed, one year or even six months ago, that, on a subject as contentious as Iraq, the European Union and United States of America would one day be able to work together to help establish lasting democracy and freedom in Iraq."
"I take some pride in having managed to assist Americans and Europeans to develop a common focus and strategy for Iraq."
"We should therefore congratulate ourselves on this outcome."
"I see that your applause is particularly lukewarm on this issue."
"If I had come back to Parliament to report that relations between Europe and the US had deteriorated further, at least half of you would have jumped to your feet claiming that the Presidency should acknowledge its grave failure on a key aspect of foreign relations."
"Similarly, Mr President, we reached agreement with neighbouring Russia on what is commonly called the ‘four spaces’."
"Our relations with Russia, which have been so important since the 10 May summit, have warmed considerably."
"This is a source of satisfaction, although we have to acknowledge that differences of opinion still remain."
"Mr President, in December 2004, under the Dutch Presidency – something we should perhaps not forget – the future Luxembourg Presidency was instructed to reach political agreement on the financial perspectives by the end of June 2005."
"On 12 January 2005, only three weeks later, I was standing before you in Strasbourg assessing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"At the time I said – and I hope you will allow me to quote; you know I love to quote myself:"
"‘We shall do all we can to reach an agreement, but I am not under any illusions."
"The Member States are currently entrenched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time’."
"I was right, and I added – to quote myself again: ‘The absence of an agreement in June will not be the Presidency’s failure…"
"... it will be Europe’s failure’."
"Here I was not right – or rather I was not entirely right."
"There are those who accuse the Presidency of being responsible for the failure because it sought to achieve the mandate set, both by the previous Presidency and by all Member States, in its entirety."
"Others claim that the disagreement is not a failure for Europe because agreements on the financial perspectives are always achieved at the eleventh hour."
"My view is that it a failure for both Europe and for the Presidency, because the disagreement on the financial perspectives, which would have been a minor hiccup under normal circumstances, coming as it did amid the uncertainty stirred up by the French and Dutch referenda, plunged us into a profound crisis."
"It is clear that those responsible for it will tell you there is no crisis."
"However, my view is that the crisis is a profound one, because it is not purely financial or budgetary."
"Let us get things in the right order."
"Firstly, between the position of those Member States who wished to restrict the European budget to 1%, and the Commission’s more generous initial position, the Presidency proposed, for the period 2007-2013, a budget for commitment appropriations totalling 1.056% of national wealth, and a budget for payment appropriations equal to 1% of national wealth."
"I have the impression that this level is now generally accepted by all Member States."
"That is now a given, and you will see that any future compromise will only differ fractionally from that level of expenditure."
"If all that happens in the future is that we advance by that fraction, I would have preferred us to have reached a decision last week."
"All my colleagues in the European Council came to Luxembourg between 30 May and 12 June, from 8.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m."
"I spent 50 hours negotiating the financial perspectives with them. If you then add the 15 hours of debates, negotiation and consultation in the European Council itself, you will see that a total of 65 hours was spent in consultation, debate and negotiations."
"Quite honestly, we could not have done more, and, quite honestly, those coming after us will do less."
"During those 50 hours of debate, which I must say were amicable and bilateral, I listened to my colleagues carefully."
"No one, and I mean no one, demanded that the British rebate be kept as it is – no one."
"In its last proposal for a final compromise, the Luxembourg Presidency upheld the principle of the British rebate: our last proposal was not that it should be frozen."
"The overall economics of the compromise were as follows: the rebate would have continued as before with regard to the 15 previous Member States – exactly and precisely as before – but the United Kingdom would have cofinanced the cohesion policy, as normal, solely in the new Member States, while not contributing to the common agricultural policy for those same Member States."
"This adjustment would have been the equivalent of an annual rebate of EUR 5.5 billion, a higher level than that for the whole of the period 1984-2005."
"Initially, the Presidency had proposed freezing the British rebate at EUR 4.7 billion, which would have enabled us to adjust the net contribution of the Netherlands by around EUR 1 billion, and to lighten the burdens of Germany and Sweden, in particular, which were felt to be excessive."
"Since you are always demanding transparency, I shall give you transparency."
"The Netherlands – its Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Finance Minister – knew that the Presidency was intending to lighten their country’s burden by EUR 1 billion per annum."
"We were unable to do so because the United Kingdom was not prepared to adjust its rebate sufficiently to give us the budgetary headroom needed to cut the Netherlands’ contribution by EUR 1 billion and alleviate the burden on Sweden and Germany."
"If the Netherlands had been granted that EUR 1 billion, Germany would have been forced to pay it to the Dutch, because the United Kingdom had not cut its rebate sufficiently."
"I wanted you to know this; I did not ask Germany to pay it because Germany, compared to its initial proposal, had already made a huge step towards the position of the other Member States."
"So, if the Presidency’s original proposal had been accepted, the problem of the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden would have been solved easily."
"The Presidency’s final proposal, for a level of EUR 5.5 billion, would not have enabled all of that to be achieved, but at least it would have enabled the UK to cofinance cohesion policies in the new Member States, as normal, with the exception of the common agricultural policy, on which, as we know, the UK has its own particular opinions."
"It is both as simple and as complicated as that."
"If only the Six who, in a moment of inspiration, wrote a joint letter, could have agreed on the details of their proposals!"
"Moreover, the Presidency proposed a declaration of the European Council in which it would have stated, and I quote, that: ‘more appropriate consideration should be given to the way in which the European budget can meet the Union's future challenges and the priorities of our citizens."
"‘All aspects of the budget’ also include the common agricultural policy."
"Trying to get us to say that this reflection should cover the common agricultural policy exclusively was a proposal we knew perfectly well would be unacceptable and thrown out by other Member States. However, if all sectors, categories and branches concerned had been brought within the scope of our critical budgetary review, this would have enabled the Commission to obtain a positive decision."
"We asked the Commission to report on all these aspects, and the Commission agreed to do so, because its President accompanied me throughout every one of the bilateral discussions during the European Council meetings."
"Incidentally, it is normal for the Commission President to attend this type of consultation."
"We therefore proposed that, on the basis of the Commission’s report, the European Council should take the appropriate decisions, also, to quote from the text I had proposed: ‘including possible adjustments to the financial perspectives for the period 2007–2013’."
"That was the decision proposed by the Presidency: the British rebate to be maintained for the 15; the British contribution to help finance cohesion policies in the new Member States, but with the common agricultural policy in those States excluded; a Commission proposal by the end of 2008 on a restructuring of the budget; the proposal to be examined by the Council with possible changes to the financial perspectives for the later years, namely from 2009 onwards."
"I wanted to tell you this because no one has yet provided this explanation and you are likely to be hearing a different one soon."
"It is not true that the Presidency was seeking to kill off the British rebate."
"We sought to maintain it for the 15-nation Europe, but to increase the impact in terms of solidarity for the new Member States."
"That was the package that was rejected."
"It was a mistake to reject it."
"The package was rejected although we had introduced a further EUR 6 billion of extra CAP expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania within the envelope of the decision made in October 2002."
"Although the letter from the Six could give the impression that they had all concurred that the October 2002 agreement should not be touched, I took this risk upon myself for the 15 – a risk moreover widely shared by the others who were happy to have found someone to take a soundly-based initiative on behalf of the 15."
"Whereas, in 2006, EUR 42 billion will be spent on direct aid and market measures, the Presidency’s proposal would have meant, for the 15-State Europe, a cut in that figure to EUR 35 billion in 2013."
"The Presidency's proposal would have involved a cut from EUR 42 billion of direct aid and market measures to EUR 35 billion in 2013, which, for the 15-nation Europe, would have meant a reduction of close to 17% for the common agricultural policy alone."
"And even in the Europe of 27 members, in other words including our Romanian and Bulgarian friends, the CAP would have been reduced by over 5% in the period in question."
"To say that nothing was done to lighten the burden of the common agricultural policy is simply untrue."
"We did everything possible to achieve it."
"In October 1985, when I presented my first budget to Parliament here – the one for 1986 – agriculture accounted for 68% of the European budget."
"I proposed that it should not exceed 37%, or EUR 35 billion, in 2013."
"What a long way we have come!"
"What obstinacy in being unable to see it!"
"Under the Presidency’s proposal, the CAP would have been the only sector where expenditure fell considerably, while, for instance, all forward-looking investment would have increased."
"A rise of 7.5% in expenditure on the Lisbon goals: 7.5% per annum for the whole period 2007–2013, representing an increase of 65% in appropriations for the Lisbon goals as compared to 2006."
"An increase of 15% for policies in the field of justice and home affairs, including, in particular, increasing the effectiveness of action to combat cross-border crime."
"Finally, a 2% increase in cohesion policies for the 27 countries, with a greater concentration on the new Member States."
"We had introduced some changes to the criteria for distribution between the old and new Member States in terms of the cohesion policies, increasing to 53% the total appropriation to the new Member States, compared to 47% in the Commission’s proposal."
"To argue that the bulk of the effort, in our proposal, would have fallen on the shoulders of the old Member States is simply not true."
"Then we come, Mr President, to a comparison of the research budget with that of the common agricultural policy, and vice versa."
"We cannot compare apples and pears."
"Why try to compare when a comparison is impossible?"
"The common agricultural policy is the sole true Community policy financed exclusively from the European budget."
"Research is, first and foremost, a national policy, supported by the Community budget."
"The two cannot be compared."
"Based on the Presidency’s proposal, the CAP would have cost EUR 305 billion for the whole of the period in question."
"The public research policies of the Member States and of the European Union, if the national policies had remained at today’s levels, would have represented EUR 524.5 billion for the period 2007–2013, far more than the common agricultural policy."
"If the European Union had proved able to make an effort as proposed by the Presidency, and the Member States had complied with their undertakings in relation to a reformulation of the Lisbon strategy, they would have increased the public share of research budgets from 1.9% to 3% of GDP."
"National and EU research policies should have reached a total of EUR 785 billion by 2013."
"If all decisions had been respected and if the Presidency’s proposals had been accepted, research budgets would have been EUR 785 billion – I am referring to the public share of research budgets – compared to EUR 305 billion for the CAP."
"So let us hear no more nonsense talked about this affair."
"Spending on the common agricultural policy would have been adjusted downwards and, on a comparison with something genuinely comparable, would be well below half the figure for research spending."
"So, let us stop comparing things which are not comparable."
"That, Mr President, is a brief summary of the facts."
"Today we have a disagreement."
"We shall have to find an agreement enabling us to introduce the new policies on good terms in the new Member States from 2007 onwards."
"We have no right to let down the new Member States which, in all my bilateral discussions with them and in the final and general discussion, behaved with remarkable dignity."
"We now have to move ahead and find a better formula, if there is one, but this must be done without destroying the mechanisms for cohesion, without watering down common policies, and without damaging the cohesion policies."
"This is essential – absolutely imperative."
"Apart from that, Luxembourg, to which I look forward to returning in the near future to devote myself exclusively to its many and, in the short term, very weighty issues, is ready to contribute wholeheartedly to a search for that solution, without bitterness or a spirit of revenge."
"Mr President, the last item on the agenda of the European Council was the process of ratifying the Constitution."
"I shall deal with this aspect more succinctly because, here, the decisions of the European Council have been reported more objectively by the participants and observers."
"It is a fact that ten countries have ratified the Constitutional Treaty, while two others, France and the Netherlands, have rejected it."
"Our view – not because we are pig-headed, stubborn or short-sighted – was that the Constitutional Treaty was not the main issue, but rather that the Constitutional Treaty was the response to many of the problems of Europe’s citizens with the European Union."
"Consequently, we opted to persevere with the ratification process."
"Some Member States, no doubt feeling the need for a period of reflection, explanation and discussion, and therefore of democracy, before going to the people either in parliament or in a referendum, decided, in the wake of that decision, to defer their scheduled referenda or parliamentary ratification."
"In those countries, the debate will take place."
"For my part, I should like this appeal, which was the appeal of the European Council, to be heard and for there to be a longer period of reflection, explanation, debate and, if necessary, disagreement throughout Europe – in the Member States who have still to ratify, in those which have already ratified and in the two which rejected the Constitutional Treaty."
"It is vital that the European debate, enriched and nourished by the ideas of everyone involved, should take place in all Member States of the European Union."
"We need to debate Europe, and I want the institutions of the Union, the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States, civil society, unions, political parties and national parliaments all to join in that vast debate."
"I also want the Commission to take its rightful place in the debate – a discussion which will be both 27-times national and European."
"I want the Commission, the guardian not only of the Treaty but above all of the spirit of the Treaty, and of the European ambition, to be at the very centre of the discussions."
"This is not to give the impression that everything is inspired, managed and predetermined in Brussels, but is aimed to ensure that this 27-times national, and therefore European, debate can be guided by wisdom and ambition."
"Mr President, I invite, recommend and urge you to involve both yourself in person and the Commission in that debate; I know you are eager to do it; you must do it, it is urgent."
"We are told, and I have said so myself, that during the budget debate we have seen a stand-off between two concepts of Europe: one based rather more on market forces, a market unable to produce solidarity, and another based, not rather more but completely, on a more highly-developed political integration."
"The free trade area on one side and political union on the other."
"This is the debate we are about to have, and we are already seeing Europe divided into two opposing camps."
"There are those who believe that Europe as it stands has already gone too far, and those, like me, who think it has still not gone far enough."
"This explanatory debate must be used to reconcile these two segments of public opinion which, today, do not talk to one another, staring at one another like statues, unable even to engage in dialogue."
"We, the European institutions, must build a bridge between these two camps of our public opinion."
"But I was considerably reassured to read that those who had thought, after the latest European Council, that there had been a clash, a conflict between two visions of Europe, were making a big mistake."
"That no one really wanted Europe to become a free trade area; that reassured me considerably."
"As you know, free trade areas cannot be established overnight."
"The less we invest in political union, the more we – unknowingly, unconsciously and imperceptibly – pave the way, with an implacable logic, for the concept of a free trade area."
"When this concept has been achieved, it will appear to have been an altogether natural development and one which rules out any possibility of going back – and supporters of the free trade area would view it as a backward step – to political union."
"There are those who say they have no intention of leading Europe towards a free trade area, an excessively simplistic concept for an ultra-complicated continent."
"It is quite simple: those who thought they were highlighting the dangers of a free trade area were wrong."
"Those who say they were wrong will use the next few months and years to show that they, too, want nothing but political union as described in the Constitution."
"It is as simple as that, a matter of saying yes or no to the question I have just asked."
"At the end of this Presidency, Mr President, I wanted to remind you, this time without quoting myself, that at the outset I had insisted on the need to respect institutional rules, to respect what is often referred to as the institutional triangle, which I still consider to offer a number of benefits."
"We have done so systematically during this Presidency."
"Between the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission there has been an exchange of views, an ongoing and virtuous debate."
"Nothing done by the Presidency has been done without the Commission's prior knowledge."
"No initiative has been taken by the Commission without the Presidency being notified in advance."
"The Presidency consulted the Commission on the initiatives it was taking, and vice versa."
"It was a great pleasure to work with this Commission, and especially with its President, and I should like to thank the Commission and its President for the large amount of good advice it gave to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Thank you Mr Barroso."
"As regards Parliament, we worked together like twins."
"We often disagreed, either because your proposals were not sensible, or because the sensible proposals of the Presidency were not accepted by all Member States and therefore could not obtain your agreement, an agreement which, however, was spontaneously forthcoming whenever the Presidency referred its initiatives to you prior to submitting them to the other Member States."
"Today, the European Parliament has reached maturity."
"I am not saying this paternalistically or with condescension, but I can gauge it by the depth of explanations, the intensity and quality of today’s debates compared to those I have heard since 1982."
"It is a great Parliament, which has no reason to keep a low profile, which has its legitimacy and which carries the hopes of the people of Europe."
"Very often in its plenary sessions not enough Members are present – not the case today, I am very pleased to say."
"Perhaps this is an area where more work is needed. I talk to Parliament and, when I leave Parliament, I talk to groups of visitors."
"Those coming to Parliament do not come just to look at the debating Chamber; they want to see it full."
"So, there is room for improvement here."
"Apart from that, we know why it is that Members cannot always be present in the Chamber."
"I must say that it is a great pleasure to work with Parliament, both in public sessions and, above all, in committees."
"What depth of knowledge, what commitment to the European cause is displayed in meetings of the parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees, and in the numerous discussions with individual Members!"
"I shall be very sorry not to be able to come to the European Parliament so regularly in future to participate in this great European debate, both here in this Chamber and elsewhere."
"Mr President, early on 18 June on the morning after the European Council, I bitterly regretted having failed to avoid Europe plunging, not irrevocably but undeniably, into a crisis."
"I regretted it and it showed."
"I have read that I was not very diplomatic, but I have no desire to be diplomatic when Europe is in crisis, none whatsoever."
"Nor did I want to be an actor, merely playing a role."
"I am not an actor, I want to work for the interests of Europe and its citizens."
"I have no time for acting."
"Because we never say what we think, because we always play a role, because we always try to be diplomatic so as not to give offence, people do not understand, people believe we are machines."
"We are not machines; we are human beings experiencing disappointment and despondency."
"I was disappointed because I had believed that Europe could be considered to have come of age, to have matured."
"I had to admit that it is still in its adolescence."
"Having believed it to be adult, I now see that we are still in the last stages of a long period of adolescence."
"That is why I am disappointed. However, I also had reasons to be pleased."
"Pleased, for instance, to have been able to do what we did – together for most of the time – and to have brought at least 20 countries to an agreement on the financial perspectives."
"20 out of 25 countries is no mean achievement."
"And I was happy and proud to hear, listen to and observe the new Member States giving us a lesson in European ambitions at the end of the European Council meeting."
"What a disgrace for those who were not able to do as much!"
"I felt my convictions being shaken in the early hours of 18 June, and did not have the strength, or the greatness, to launch another appeal on the same day."
"Not everyone can be De Gaulle."
"I am surprised at my own modesty."
"I had felt my convictions undermined for a moment, but after a few days had passed, after receiving thousands of letters from the length and breadth of Europe, after receiving encouragement from the Commission, Parliament and many observers who are also protagonists, I now feel, now that the first disappointment has passed, more determined than ever."
"Our generation does not have the right to undo the achievements of prior generations."
"We do not have the right to demolish the work of our predecessors, because future generations will need a political Europe."
"If it is not political, it will lose its way."
"They need and want a Europe of solidarity, a social Europe, a competitive Europe, a Europe which is strong at home and strong in the world."
"So, members of old Europe, committed Europeans, back to work!"
"With enthusiasm!"
"Mr President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time, one of my teachers advised me always to be pessimistic because, that way, all my life, I would either be right or pleasantly surprised."
"To judge from the reactions and events of the past few days, pessimism would seem to be fully justified, but I must tell you that I do not believe in pessimism."
"I think I can say that, now more than ever, we need to show our determination."
"It is true that there are problems in Europe, and it is true that they are serious problems, but we must confront them and be able to find a solution."
"During the Luxembourg Presidency, we have witnessed the implementation of grand initiatives and innovations which will guide the activities of the European Union over the years to come."
"Let me start by going back, from the Commission’s viewpoint, over these last six months, a period that has been marked by the experience and the European conviction of my friend Mr Juncker."
"First of all, we succeeded in adopting our strategic objectives for the EU over the coming five years."
"It was the first time that they were approved jointly with the Council and Parliament."
"Today, those same broad guiding principles in terms of prosperity, solidarity and security provide us with a framework, a framework shared by all the institutions of the European Union."
"We therefore have the opportunity for our actions to be much more effective and focused, and to be able to translate our actions into a true partnership for renewal."
"It is also thanks to the Luxembourg Presidency that we have negotiated an agreement on how to base the Stability and Growth Pact on a more realistic and practical foundation."
"This reform has neither weakened nor relaxed the pact."
"It has even given governments greater flexibility, via the financial instruments, to optimise growth over the economic cycle."
"However, the greatest success of the Luxembourg Presidency, from the point of view of the Commission’s priorities, may have been the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy during the Spring European Council."
"This was a step forward, not only for the institutions and governments, but also for all European citizens."
"It is worth remembering that, however important the interinstitutional debate is, the majority of Europeans, when they get together as a family, at school, at work or at leisure, do not discuss the possible configurations of the blocking minority in the system of qualified majority voting."
"What actually concerns our fellow citizens is the slowdown in the economy."
"Above all, they are anxious about their jobs or the difficulty of finding work."
"That is why we have relaunched the Lisbon Strategy: growth and employment."
"That is why we think that we must, all of us, the European institutions, increase our efforts in areas that directly affect the lives of our citizens."
"That is the route to take to reforge the links between Europe and its citizens and to respond to the concerns of Europeans."
"That said, there have been other successes during the Luxembourg Presidency, particularly in our external relations."
"President Juncker has already mentioned this: the summit with Russia, those with Canada and the United States, the better relationship we now have with our great partner on the other side of the Atlantic, all of that can be credited to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"During the last European Council, we primarily discussed two questions: what should we do during this period following the referenda in the Netherlands and France and what should we do with regard to the financial perspectives?"
"First of all, the debate on the future of Europe."
"The European Council’s decision seems to me to be a wise one."
"The European leaders decided to have a period of reflection and have opened the door to debate, dialogue and democracy."
"You doubtless remember that the Commission said, just on the eve of the European Council, that it, for its part, wanted to launch this debate by going, if necessary, and this is what we are going to do, to all the Member States of the EU to debate and to listen, not only to the governments, which is certainly important, but also to the parliaments, the social partners and young people in these countries."
"We are very proud that the European Council has given us a mandate to have a special role in this enterprise, in this debate that must be organised in each Member State, but that must also be held at European level."
"We are going to do that, and we hope that, at the end of this exercise, we will be able to present to all Europeans our strategic vision for Europe."
"What will Europe be like in the coming years, in the six or fifteen years to come?"
"We must launch this debate without being afraid of any of the subjects, even those that are more difficult and more complex for the institutions."
"We must discuss not only expenditure but also our aims."
"We must talk about the European social model."
"How can we work on it in the 21st century?"
"How can we modernise this European social model?"
"How can we reach an equilibrium with regard to Community legislation?"
"How can we avoid bureaucracy at European level?"
"How can we deal with further enlargement, such that Europeans can support it and understand the importance of having a united Europe?"
"We are sure that the European Parliament will have a contribution, a very important contribution, to make to this debate and we, the European Commission, want to work with you because we think it is necessary to build a new consensus in Europe."
"I shall now turn to the other main subject of last week’s summit."
"It was very disappointing that we were unable to reach a conclusion on the financial perspective."
"The presidency worked tirelessly for a breakthrough and I have to say that we were near an agreement."
"Unfortunately, discussions on the budget have seldom brought out the best in the Member States and, sadly, last week it was no different."
"There are some fundamentally different views and some clear national interests, but this in itself is not so unusual."
"What makes the situation especially delicate is that this ‘no solution’ for the financial perspective comes after two ‘noes’ in two national referenda."
"I regret that, during the European Council, no leaders were able to show a true spirit of compromise and solidarity on that very important occasion."
"But it would be wrong to give the impression that we have gone nowhere as a result of last week."
"The committed work of the Luxembourg presidency over the last six months has brought us a long way."
"This is important because there is a real urgency to get an agreement."
"If we do not reach agreement, then there is a risk of paralysis which will have a very negative effect on our policies and on all the Member States, particularly the new Member States."
"I want to underline the very constructive approach taken by the new Member States."
"Sometimes people ask me whether it is not more difficult to be in the Commission now with 25 – and very soon to be 27 – Member States."
"Is it not a much more complex and difficult European Union?"
"I say it is, but let us be frank."
"The problems we now have in Europe are not the result of the demands of the new Member States; they are not the cause of the problems we have in Europe today."
"When we consider the work of the Luxembourg presidency we have to say that we cannot go backwards."
"We must build on the outgoing presidency’s achievements in order to get an agreement as soon as possible."
"The incoming presidency has made it clear that it also intends to take these dossiers forward and we now wait with interest for the UK presidency to relaunch the process."
"The Commission is ready to work with this presidency and all the Member States."
"More work is needed."
"I made it clear last week that I have real problems with the downgrading of some of the policies that the Commission and Parliament have emphasised."
"This is particularly true of those policies aimed at renewed economic dynamism."
"Genuine reform comes at a price."
"Reducing the Commission’s proposed spending in areas such as research, innovation, education or transport and energy networks will have a real policy cost."
"Our citizens are unlikely to be forgiving if we fail to deliver on our promise regarding growth and jobs."
"But let us be frank."
"The problem, when the Council reduced the ambition of proposal by the Commission and Parliament, and when the Council decided to follow the ‘one per cent club’, was that the areas that were particularly sacrificed were precisely those of competitiveness, growth, education, innovation and research."
"Cohesion was more or less kept."
"The common agricultural policy was, of course, maintained in accordance with the agreement made three years ago, but there were major cuts in the areas of competitiveness, growth, innovation and research."
"This shows the price of that famous letter from six of the Member States asking for one per cent."
"It is a pity that the Member States that agreed on one per cent expenditure – the ones agreeing on that – cannot now agree in the European Council."
"In fact, they were divided on the issue."
"It shows what happens all too often today in Europe."
"It is easier to get a coalition for a ‘no’ vote than to get a coalition for a ‘yes’, when what we need in Europe now are coalitions for ‘yes’ and not more coalitions for ‘no’."
"These important coalitions are needed for the project for Europe to go forward."
"The Commission will go on with its work and will pursue the goal of reaching a balanced agreement with the Member States."
"This must involve Parliament."
"We want to be sure that when the European Council is ready to reach an agreement it can be swiftly followed by the signing of an interinstitutional agreement between all parties: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The negotiations will only be over at that moment."
"I count on Parliament’s support in this respect."
"I do not want to underestimate the degree of difficulty nor the disagreements on priorities, but this necessary debate should not delay an agreement."
"This is why, even before the European Council, the Commission proposed a review clause."
"I was very happy to work with President-in-Office Juncker and, as he said earlier, we were discussing a review clause with the Member States."
"This means that, as we do not know exactly what the world will be like in 2013, we should not have an overall debate before we approve the financial perspective."
"On the contrary, we should approve the financial perspective as soon as possible and then arrange a meeting later in order to adapt our budget to changing priorities and the international environment."
"This is wisdom itself."
"What we cannot use now is an overall debate on priorities as a reason or pretext for not reaching an agreement on the financial perspective."
"However, at the same time, it is true that we should engage in a serious debate about the reform of the Community budget."
"We must look forward."
"It is also true that we should have a meeting at a later stage in order to address all those important questions."
"This is why we should keep to the deadline for the next phase of the negotiations."
"If we do not do this, we could fail, and it is my duty to draw the attention of this Parliament to a risk of paralysis in the European Union."
"We must avoid that risk."
"Even during this very difficult situation, we are continuing to take decisions."
"As President-in-Office Juncker said, after the European Council we were taking decisions with our partners in the United States and Canada."
"Yesterday I was in Italy for the inauguration of the European Food Safety Authority."
"Today the Commission took important decisions on a Green Paper on energy efficiency and a new regime for the sugar markets."
"We are continuing to make decisions."
"I promise you that the Commission does not feel any kind of inhibitions about taking the decisions or initiatives that Europe deserves."
"However, it is important now to engage the Council, all partners and all institutions and to move in the same direction."
"I ask you not to overlook the other achievements of the European Council."
"We have seen the endorsement of the new integrated guidelines for growth and employment and an action plan to implement The Hague Programme for freedom, security and justice."
"These two results address our key objectives of prosperity and security and the mainstream concerns of our citizens."
"The European Council also approved guiding principles for sustainable development."
"This should ensure continuing improvements to the quality of life, not only for current generations but also for future ones."
"There was also the very important decision to confirm at the highest level – at a European Union summit – the decisions taken by the development ministers following a Commission proposal about our commitment to overseeing development aid and our commitment to Africa."
"This was a very important step taken by the European Council."
"What follows now?"
"Is the glass half empty or half full?"
"As I said before, the problem is serious but we can turn it into an opportunity."
"Sooner or later this clarification had to come and, let us face it, we now have that opportunity."
"We are closer to agreement on the financial perspective than many people realise."
"We should also remember that never in the history of the European Union have financial packages been approved during the first round of negotiations."
"Therefore, I call on all the parties concerned to reflect on the consequences of deadlock and to show some flexibility."
"I call on all the parties to show less nationalistic rhetoric and to engage in a truly European solution."
"The fact remains that both the Luxembourg presidency in general and the European Council in particular have achieved much of which we can be proud."
"It is true that there is still much to do."
"Together with the Members of this House, the Commission will work for a future that confirms Europe’s capacity to do business, even if the times do not call for business as usual."
"We will then be able to prove that the pessimists and the cynics are not always right and that there are reasons to have confidence in the future."
"I would like to finish with a few words for my friend Mr Juncker."
"Not only for Mr Juncker, but also for the whole of the Luxembourg Presidency, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the Minister for European Affairs, for the diplomats and for the experts."
"I have been really moved to see the conviction, the determination and the enthusiasm of everybody in this extraordinary team."
"On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to thank you, Jean-Claude, and all your colleagues, for what you have done for Europe."
"I sincerely hope that I will be able to say the same thing to the next President of the European Council."
"I will say the same thing if I think it, but I will not say it if I do not think it."
"Presidencies come and go, but the Commission remains."
"The Commission defends the general interests of Europe and I would say to you that the Commission, with the support of this Parliament, I hope, will continue to give its full sincere support to the various Presidencies."
"For its part, the Commission expects the various Presidencies to have the same vocation, the same determination and the same enthusiasm for our European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, before all else, to express the heartfelt gratitude of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the President-in-Office of the European Council, for the great passion and conviction with which he has led us, in the European Union, through these months. For this dedication, for this passion, for this conviction, Mr Juncker, you have the warm thanks of the PPE-DE Group."
"On Saturday morning, the President-in-Office of the European Council’s disappointment was plain for us all to see, and this disappointment we shared with him."
"We hope the day will come when we will again be able to join together in rejoicing over successes, and that is now a task for all of us."
"The fact that the President of this House referred a short time ago to the Soviet occupation, 65 years ago, of the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – is itself a sign of hope."
"Who, 20 years ago, would have thought that there would be Members in this House hailing from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania?"
"It is because that is such a tremendous thing that we must, even now, believe in our continent’s future."
"Any attempt at analysis must start from the situation as it now stands, and to those who say, ‘we are in a state of political crisis’, I say, ‘I agree with you’."
"We must, though, make it our concern that this political crisis should not disorient us and seduce us into activity for activity’s sake, and so we must respond with determination and deliberation."
"We believe in this Europe of ours, and, for that reason, the political will must be there to lead this Europe of ours, this European Union, into a bright future."
"We find ourselves, though, in a twofold crisis of confidence; one that involves various protagonists in the European Council and has been building up for several years, and a crisis as regards many people’s confidence in the European Union’s policymakers."
"Many people feel that a lot of things are going too fast, and we must regard the regaining of their trust as a common endeavour."
"What is our goal?"
"We want a European Union that is strong, effective and democratic, and all those who want to make it no more than a free trade zone within Europe will have a fight on their hands."
"Our Group wants no part of any such thing; we want a strong, effective and democratic European Union, one that enables us to defend our interests in the world."
"We say the same thing to those who believe that what we need today is the rebuilding of axes; we have heard of one proposal for a Franco-German Union, while others are dreaming of a change of government ushering in an axis between the United Kingdom and Germany."
"To those who think like this I have this to say: on the contrary, while we need good bilateral relationships, they must be offered to the European Union as a whole, and it is on this basis of goodwill that we, in the European Union, must then function as a community."
"It is worth my adding that the Treaty of Nice makes provision for enhanced cooperation."
"If some countries want to go further, we can do just that in many areas – foreign and security policy among them."
"Where the Constitutional Treaty is concerned, we must be self-critical."
"The referendum in Luxembourg is now, no doubt, going to go ahead on 10 July, and I wish the President-in-Office every success in it."
"We now have a pause for thought, and we must use it in order to think."
"Rather than having a respite from thinking, we must use the time we now have in order to think and to ensure that, when this process of reflection is over, Parts 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Treaty can become legal and political realities."
"If I may turn to the European Union’s budget, we find the failure to achieve a result regrettable, but we – including Reimer Böge, who is present in the Chamber – can take some pride in the fact that this House has succeeded in putting together a proposal, and we call on the Heads of State or Government to take it as their guide and to seek to make the reforms that are needed."
"This House has already given its answer."
"This Financial Perspective is needed – and I say this with the utmost seriousness – for those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and that must be able to rely on our common solidarity in planning how they are to develop their weakest regions."
"It is for that reason that I hope we will be able to complete this Financial Perspective, which we owe to the European Union’s new Member States, under the incoming British presidency."
"We in the PPE-DE Group will play our part in making this possible, and we will do so in a spirit of solidarity."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, totting up the debits and credits of the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council has been an emotional business."
"We have heard a speech that was extraordinary not only by reason of the character of the man delivering it, but also by reason of its extraordinary frankness."
"I have been a Member of this House for 11 years."
"In all that time, I have never come across such frankness in a presentation on a European Council by its Presidency."
"For this frankness I am grateful, for it gives this House greater knowledge and hence affords it the opportunity to better analyse what transpired last weekend."
"A lot happened, and let me repeat at the very outset what you, Mr President-in-Office, said: it was a defeat for Europe."
"You were right there."
"You went on to say that it also represented a defeat for the Presidency, but that is where you are wrong."
"Anyone who saw you over the weekend – and we all did – saw something that was not a defeat for the Council Presidency."
"It may well, today, be too early to judge, but I am quite certain that those who come after us will rank Jean-Claude Juncker among the truly great Europeans."
"For that we are grateful to you."
"After 60 hours of negotiations, followed by a 15-minute visit from one who had participated in them, we can understand some of the bitterness that came out in your speech, for it is a fact that what emerges from this summit is that the time really has come for the European Union to spell out the facts."
"Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, but then so are its Heads of State or Government."
"The fact is that, for years, the people who hold the reins of power in Europe – in other words, the European Council, the Heads of State or Government – have invariably taken the same approach. Victory was theirs; it was the Brussels bureaucrats who lost."
"It became clear from last weekend’s summit that we can now put a name to what has caused Europe to lose out: the particularism of those Heads of State or Government who believe that the interests of all are served when each thinks only of himself."
"Parliaments exist to give expression to what the public feels, and you are right to say that high diplomacy belongs somewhere else; this is where the truth has to be told."
"Today, Mr Juncker, I want to give you every credit for telling it like it is and for calling things by their proper names."
"We have lessons to learn from that, and one important one is that we should start by noting that, of the three institutions, two have done their homework; the Commission produced its proposal for the Financial Perspective, and Parliament decided on its position, while the Council has shown itself incapable of coming to an agreement on it."
"Let me point out that two of the institutions that participate in the trialogue have done what they had to do."
"The Council has not, and we will wait."
"It is not acceptable that everyone sitting around the table should be saying ‘I’m right’."
"Then the next person to be called upon to speak says, ‘I’m right, too’."
"The third person to speak also says, ‘That may well be so, but I’m right’."
"How such people can reach a result that is of any use to Europe escapes me."
"Above all else, I simply do not see how a head of government, of whatever country, can say, ‘I have quite specific goals’, and then, by his own actions, help to wreck the instruments that are needed in order to achieve those goals."
"I simply do not get it, and I do not see this as something that this House can take lying down."
"What is the Financial Perspective about?"
"It is about everyone making a move."
"We do, of course know that our continent’s ability to survive depends on our promotion of innovation, research and technology, and that these things are crucial to the Lisbon process."
"We also know, of course, that we need money in order to do these things, and that it follows that money has to be reassigned."
"Yet, if everyone knows that, why do we not get the right results?"
"Let me tell you what I think, what my very personal opinion is: it is that the reason lies in the fact that, this weekend, European policy was, yet again, not the deciding factor."
"Things were of course said about Europe’s future, but most of the speeches made there were devoted to internal policy."
"We all know that there is a great island state in this Union, where internal party constraints limit room for manoeuvre."
"We all know too that there is a great continental state in this Union in which the results of elections hang upon agriculture."
"There may be many more internal policy considerations than these two, the effects of which on European policy we Europeans have to live with, so let us, in this House, unite in saying that we are no longer prepared to do so, for this is proving to be Europe’s ruin!"
"The President deserves praise for having, today, delivered himself of a fine affirmation of his role in Europe."
"You, Mr Barroso, are indeed the guardian of the European Treaties."
"Nobody will be able to make the Treaty of Nice serve as the basis for a free trade zone; it may be inadequate, but it has taken the process of integration far too far for that to be possible, and if you want to defend the deepening of Europe, this House will always be right alongside you."
"What the people of Europe are now waiting for, though, is signals from Europe; we do indeed need the market, we do indeed need internal and external competition, but those in the Netherlands and in France who voted ‘no’ did so not least because they feared that this market, this competition, would wreck their social security, destroying what has been built up over decades."
"In the realm of practical politics, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have produced a five-point plan showing how you can help get the Working Time Directive and the Services Directive adopted as social – rather than as anti-social – legislation."
"That will give you a chance to show where the Commission stands."
"We have heard a great speech from a great President."
"Not only he, but also the Luxembourg team as a whole have – as the President of the Commission rightly said – done a terrific job, and for that, Mr Juncker, I thank you, as well as Mr Schmit and all those who have worked together with us this past six months."
"Working with the Luxembourg Presidency was – I believe, for all of us – an extraordinarily pleasant business."
"Differences of opinion are not always so pleasant in this political life."
"Thank you for your speech, and I believe I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that I look forward to tomorrow with eager anticipation."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"President-in-Office, if the Luxembourg presidency has failed your expectations, I hope you will not blame yourself."
"President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats in this House applaud your attempts to keep the EU show on the road."
"You tried hard to strike the deals Europe needs."
"Your lack of success was not for lack of effort."
"Your final summit was doomed from the moment France voted to reject the Constitution."
"The triumphalism of the ‘no’ voters, however, will be short lived."
"In Greek tragedy, actors often deepen their own plight while believing that their actions will help them to escape it."
"So is the case with the French and the Socialists who were their cheerleaders."
"Their votes will bring to bear the very changes they most fear."
"At least in Greek tragedy the audience is permitted to understand what is happening."
"That luxury is available to many of us only with hindsight some time after the referenda."
"I suspect that you, President-in-Office, through your passionate commitment to the European cause, which I welcome, were unable to stand back and look objectively at the impact on your presidency of the week of 29 May 2005."
"Had you done so you might have looked upon that week as a defining moment in the history of a European Union that will never be the same again."
"Hence your final summit was characterised not by the pockets of resistance of which you spoke optimistically, but by a fight between two ailing dinosaurs, Britain and France."
"Unable to admit that national sovereignty is a luxury of the past, they persist in trying to impose their order on others."
"Britain seeks a British Europe rather than a European Britain."
"France is just as insular without the excuse of being an island."
"Both harbour a dangerous illusion, for there can be only one Europe, truly European."
"That Europe must have the necessary funding to function."
"The insistence by some Member States on one per cent of GNI would deprive us of the Lisbon investment, as indeed your final proposal might have done."
"It is perhaps better to have no agreement and to re-think both how we raise money and how we spend it, than to reach agreement at any cost."
"But to those who seek to use these setbacks to re-establish an iron curtain, I would quote Robert Schuman, who said in 1949: ‘I have no intention of drawing a geographical line of demarcation between Europe and non-Europe."
"There is another way of setting limits: that which distinguishes those who have the European spirit and those who have not.’"
"President-in-Office, the Franco-German motor of European integration on which your presidency relied is kaput."
"We need another motor to replace it."
"It must be neither British nor French."
"The Union must recognise that it has moved on from reconciliation and security of food supply to other demands of a rapidly changing world: a world that will not wait for Europe."
"So do not allow this pause for reflection to be a period of paralysis."
"Go home and make sure you win your referendum."
"Then mobilise the other smaller states to prevent the prehistoric predators from destroying what has been built."
"Take satisfaction from the achievements of your presidency: the agreement on the Euro-vignette for transport infrastructure charging; the action plan for The Hague Programme; the agreement on a European driving licence; and, with luck, even the elusive Members’ Statute to demonstrate the maturity of this House."
"All of these mark good progress for the Union, and you may well conclude that you are left with more than just an overflowing ashtray."
"As Aristotle taught us, we may not always achieve our goals, but it is our pursuit of them that changes the course of history."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, in order to make the European Union function, it were enough to have an effective Presidency of the Council and a President-in-Office endowed with a firm belief in Europe and a certain charisma and credibility, we would be home and dry."
"Mr Juncker, I also say to you that if you genuinely wished to continue your work, you could perhaps have chosen the presidency of another, rather more stable institution, and you might have been able to play a more direct part in a European debate that we, in fact, believe is very important."
"Luxembourg and its Prime Minister have steered the Union well during these turbulent months but that has not helped to restore confidence among the French and Dutch electorate, or to revive the European economic machine, or to put positive initiatives in the pipeline, of the sort that people dream about."
"The European Council has only confirmed the reality of a divided Europe of governments, which is perhaps not even very interested in nursing a genuine ambition in the face of a Europe of uncertain and frightened peoples."
"We regret, Mr Juncker, that the last action of your Presidency has been to put forward a genuinely unacceptable budget proposal, unacceptable because it follows the same failing logic of an unsustainable reduction of the Union’s budget."
"I greatly respect your pragmatism, your realism and understanding of the difficulty and the complicated calculations that you have outlined to us here."
"It is also true, however, that even your proposal included cutbacks to positive policies – to the development policy, to the rural development policy, and even to the sacred Lisbon policy – that are not acceptable for today’s Europe."
"We therefore genuinely hope that, once your Presidency has come to an end, your government will throw out such a proposal, partly because we believe that that could help you in your referendum."
"Today, it seems that those who only want Europe to be a large supermarket have a definite advantage compared with those who want a political Europe."
"For now they are the only ones who have been strengthened by the twin ‘no’ vote, and I believe that we will have further confirmation of that tomorrow, when Tony Blair will come to us, spruce and smiling, explaining how to make Europe even more intergovernmental and weak."
"The only plan in sight for now is clearly the Blair plan."
"My group therefore believes that the failure to reach an unsatisfactory agreement on the financial perspectives is a positive result and considers it important that the Council has given itself time to reflect on the Constitution, without, however, putting an end to the ratification process for those who wish for it to continue."
"I can already tell you today, Mr President, that a great many members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support you for the referendum in Luxembourg."
"We believe, however, that this reflection needs to be given time, method and clear objectives, and that, in terms of the financial perspectives, difficult chapters that already seemed to be closed need to be reopened."
"It is on those two issues that the conflict between the ‘supermarketeers’ and the unionists will burn itself out."
"We therefore might as well begin to sharpen our weapons, Mr Juncker, because it is really not worth losing our way in abstruse compromises, even if they have brought 20 ministers together."
"If we genuinely believe that political union remains the aim, and if we are genuinely ashamed of having to accept the initiative of the ten new Member States on the budget, then we need to act immediately and unambiguously."
"Forget about agreeing on the details!"
"We have to reject the letter of the Six, finally begin to see that the debate on the size of the budget has to be based on the political priorities, and not the other way round, and reopen the debate on everything: the CAP, Life-Nature and the Structural Funds."
"Then, Mr Barroso, we also have to do ‘something European’, in the words of a famous Italian film director, something quite different from the Bolkestein Directive, software patenting, the arbitrary and secretive authorisation of new GMOs, or a bit of hot air on sustainable development, whereas in reality – alas – environmental policy is becoming an increasingly marginal issue in your Commission."
"Reflection on the future of Europe and its legitimacy will be made much easier if Europe has something to offer in the months to come: REACH, an action on climate change, the tangible redefinition of social Europe, the working time directive, serious attention paid to the Millennium Round commitments."
"All of this is perfectly feasible and will help us to revive the Constitution."
"I will conclude, Mr President: we have very serious doubts that reflection on the Constitution can be carried forward and guided by the bickering crowd operating at the top, and the European Parliament has to take some of the responsibility for that."
"Mr Borrell, I will address you in the very few seconds remaining: I would like Parliament not to be just a talk show, but you yourself to sponsor an action to place it at the centre of a European-initiative debate."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Frassoni; addressing the President of Parliament does not excuse you from having to respect speaking time."
"Mr President, Mr Juncker, Mr Barroso, I would like to start by extending my warmest thanks to Mr Juncker for the respect he has just shown the European Parliament by giving us such a sincere, transparent and enlightening report on the European Council."
"In my 26 years of parliamentary experience, this is a first for me."
"I will return to this in a moment, and tomorrow, but, before that, I would like to dwell for a moment on the last topic brought up by Mr Juncker: the ratification of the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"I note with interest that, three weeks after the success of the ‘no’ vote to the ex-draft Constitutional Treaty, the truth is gradually pushing its way to the fore, both with regard to the demands expressed by these votes and with regard to their scope, which goes far beyond the two countries directly concerned."
"Thus, a survey commissioned by the Commission itself, following the referendum in France, was analysed in these terms in the Eurobarometer bulletin; I quote: ‘social concerns … [are] … at the heart of the “no” vote’."
"Among the main reasons cited for voting ‘no’ are that, and I quote: ‘economically speaking the draft is seen as too liberal’ and ‘the lack of social Europe’."
"The commentary adds, and again I quote, that ‘the rejection of Turkey’s membership of the EU was mentioned spontaneously by only 6% of people who voted “no”’."
"The electorate’s choice was, as the Eurobarometer document notes, made after careful consideration."
"We should also add that just 4% of the people surveyed declared themselves to be against Europe."
"The message is therefore clear: ‘yes’ to Europe, including an enlarged Europe, but ‘no’ to the liberal direction it is taking."
"This sentiment is shared by many other peoples, which doubtless explains the domino effect of the first two ‘no’ votes."
"Lessons are starting to be drawn from these great manifestations of the citizens’ crisis of conscience with regard to Europe as it is, including by the European Trade Union Confederation, which has just called on the 25 to take into consideration, and I quote, ‘fear of lower social standards and neo-liberal policies’ in order to regain the confidence of European citizens."
"This is the context in which we need to assess the last European Council."
"Let us summarise."
"It has decided to continue with the process of ratifying the ex-Constitutional Treaty by, and I quote, ‘altering the timetable according to circumstances’, which is a singularly cavalier attitude to democracy."
"It has agreed, and again I quote, ‘to reflect together’, to gain some time, as a high-up European official was kind enough to specify."
"Primarily, the European Council has, moreover, provided European opinion with the grossest caricature of this commercial, egotistical, directionless Europe, which our fellow citizens, as it happens, have quite rightly rejected: we could not have done better in turning our backs on the expectations of Europeans."
"In this regard, Mr Juncker, having worked so hard to avoid such a deplorable outcome, found the right words to denounce the main culprit for this fiasco."
"Beyond that, it is the whole club of six, these countries which have, for months, been consumed by their obsession to freeze budgets at 1% of European revenues, that, in my view, incarnates a narrow concept of Europe, with no relation to our declared ambitions."
"What real alternatives are there, not only in budgetary terms, but in terms of the direction of the institutional criteria: that, in the opinion of my group, is the agenda for the great citizens’ debate that we need to have on a European scale, and which I called for during our last part-session by quite particularly addressing the left of the House."
"Mr Schulz appears to be responding positively to this idea, but in a very institutional context."
"It seems to me that three of the conditions for the success of such a debate are, first, that it should be free from any pressure; next, that it should be open to actual citizens and not to institutional representatives of civil society; and, finally, that it should result in a new treaty that our fellow citizens can support this time."
"I would add that the specific decisions that will be taken at European level during this pause for reflection must also demonstrate, in the eyes of our fellow citizens, our ability to listen to their message and our determination to take it fully into account."
"However, we will discuss that tomorrow in the presence of our next Presidency, which will clearly be different from the outgoing one."
"The great debate on the future of Europe is getting off to a good start."
"I have often praised the Luxembourg Presidency."
"You always do things well at a technical level, but today I must criticise you, Mr Juncker, for the summit’s decision to continue the ratification process with a document rejected by the French in a binding referendum."
"What an insult to your French neighbours and Dutch friends from the Benelux countries!"
"What contempt for the law!"
"The Treaty of Nice is unambiguously clear: it may only be altered by a unanimous vote, and there is no such unanimity now that the Netherlands has said that it will not ratify the Constitution."
"What a retreat from reality, too!"
"All reflective people know that that document would never survive a referendum in, for example, Great Britain."
"The Constitution is dead."
"One should bury the dead, and doing so cannot be deferred or postponed."
"With all respect, even you cannot breathe life into a corpse by threatening to withdraw as Prime Minister if the Luxembourgers also politely reject a Constitution that, on the basis of population figures and with no proper exercise of democracy, would shift power from the electorate to officials."
"You are wasting time."
"Let us, rather, start afresh. Let us bring the same number of proponents and opponents of the Constitution together and prepare a joint consultation document for new ground rules."
"We shall be able to discuss this and elect a new Convention able to represent the electorate’s attitude to Europe’s future."
"We shall then be able to obtain a practical, brief and easily understandable cooperation agreement able to be adopted in referenda on the same two days in all the EU countries."
"If we devise an agreement that is better than the Treaty of Nice, most Europeans will naturally vote in favour of it."
"If the watchwords are transparency, democracy and proximity to the people, we shall also be happy to do so."
"A new opinion poll shows that 80% of Danes support the proposal to reverse the burden of proof in matters of transparency and that 79% want each country to be able to elect its own Commissioner."
"There are only, respectively, 11% and 12% of Danes who are opposed to these proposals."
"That is the type of support we should be seeking by means of a new treaty."
"We should not be seeking a Constitution to take precedence over Luxembourg’s and other countries’ constitutions."
"–Madam President, the outcome of the European Council does not come as a shocking surprise, for after the ‘cold shower’ of the French and Dutch referenda we could not have expected that everything would turn out as the Presidency had envisaged."
"It proved to be the case that the enlargement of the European Union and its possible socio-economic threats – immigration, wherever it may come from, economic liberalisation, whoever may have demanded it, played a significant part in forming a negative attitude."
"That is how the citizens of the European Union perceived it."
"With reference, however, to what has been said and taking into account also other negative attitudes towards the European Union revealed in opinion surveys, undoubtedly the greatest responsibility lies with the politicians of the Member States."
"Too much is demanded of the European Union and Member States have been prepared to invest too little in order for the European Union to go from success to success."
"Politicians from the Member States have been eager to nationalise and attribute to themselves too many of the European Union’s true achievements, and to attribute to Europe their own domestic political failures."
"Too often, when taking difficult domestic political decisions, politicians from the Member States do not forget to justify them by reference to European Union requirements."
"It seems that we have overspent our credit."
"There exist two visions of the European Union’s future – one of a political European Union and one of a European Union of high-level economic cooperation."
"In truth, these two visions are two sides of the same coin – without economic and also social integration it will not be possible to build a sustainable edifice of political integration."
"That, to my mind, is the clearest lesson of the last two referenda."
"We have to create the socio-economic preconditions for the citizens of the European Union to be able to assess and understand why political integration is necessary, why we, for example, wish to call the European Treaty a Constitution."
"Can we really consider the Council meeting to be a long-term failure?"
"It approved the Lisbon Strategy, a strategy that means a lot more than integration of the internal market."
"The Lisbon Strategy is the model for cooperation in the European Union which, when applied to its fullest extent, would help to organise in the European Union the ambitions of our economic and social policy, a direction for Europe to grow as united and competitive, and in the medium term to regain the confidence of society."
"The Lisbon agenda, which has been a blatant example of the European Union’s indecisiveness in the past five years, must become an example of success and cooperation in the future."
"That, however, can only be implemented if we can overcome the attitude towards cooperation in the European Union that we have exhibited until now."
"It is enough to recall the current unproductive debates on the Services Directive, which is a cornerstone of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The concluding words of the agreement on the Lisbon Strategy have demonstrated that the Council has partners who are engaged in the future of the European Union, and who will be able to find a basis for important tasks – security and cooperation, the enlargement of the European Union and cohesion policy."
"Madam President, it was Bertolt Brecht who quipped that political leaders should simply choose a different people when the people vote incorrectly."
"That statement by the German playwright is more topical than ever when we see the frenetic efforts that are being made – only last week at the failed summit in Brussels – to ignore the vote of the Dutch and the French people."
"Allow me to quote a small example from my own country to illustrate my point."
"My party, the , which is the largest party in Flanders, being opposed to the European superstate of which the Constitution is the groundplan, was not even allowed to take part in the radio and television debates that were organised on the subject."
"The conduct of the media and political elites was much like that of the pigs in George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’; all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."
"Everyone claims that the bookkeepers’ mentality of some egos in European politics blocked an agreement on the multi-annual budget, because it involved some USD 1 000 billion for seven years while, by way of comparison, the annual budget of the US alone amounts to USD 2 500 billion."
"What matters is not so much whether Europe spends enough money in order to meet tomorrow’s challenges, but that it should do so by using its funds differently."
"Europe should not get involved in matters that would, in the final analysis, be regulated more effectively at national level."
"Europe should really start observing the principle of subsidiarity if it wants to count on the public’s understanding."
"When I see in Flanders how Europe’s billions, via the structural funds, end up in the bottomless pits of Wallonian profiteers, I can only sympathise with such people as the Dutch Prime Minister, who was treated with such contempt by our own Foreign Affairs Minister on account of his consistent stance."
"At the risk of shocking some of you, it follows that I cannot get too excited about the failure of last week’s summit."
"Contrary to what some are trying to make out, neither the world, nor Europe, will collapse as a result of it."
"One positive thing that came out of the summit was that everyone, including the most die-hard supporters of unrestrained enlargement, is now agreed that a period of reflection is what is called for before we hurtle down the path we have chosen."
"If the voice of the Dutch and French people calls a halt to the undemocratic process of Turkish accession, in respect of which bureaucracy is flying in the face of what Europeans want, the end of the European Constitution might well spell the beginning of a fresh and different Europe where the will of the people is taken into consideration."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the summit that brought the Luxembourg Presidency to a close did not yield the success for which most of us in this House had hoped."
"We all know what was decided in Brussels and, moreover, what was not."
"I now want to convey two messages on behalf of Luxembourg’s Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"The first is a message of appreciation for the outstanding achievements of the Luxembourg Presidency in general and of the President, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, in particular."
"When individual Heads of State or Government are so arrogant, presumptuous and motivated by pure self-interest as to be prepared to jeopardise the progress of the European project and the success of enlargement, then we cannot expect what comes out of the summit to move Europe any further forward."
"I do not propose to enlarge on what consequences this may have for the future of the European Union, but what I will say is that, if a few European Heads of Government want to put on the sort of performance that we saw last week, then we will not be able to win back the trust of those who, in France and the Netherlands, voted against the European Constitution."
"My second message I bring as one who survived the Second World War, as one who, well advanced in years, is able, in this House, to work for the European cause alongside Members from the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, and as one who can do no other than quote what Mr Juncker said: ‘The last European Council makes me feel ashamed.’"
"I am ashamed of the evident fact that certain Heads of Government in the western half of our continent have no concept of what the eastward enlargement is all about, nor of the European Union being anything other than a continental bargain-basement."
"I am ashamed of our inability, over a year after enlargement, to motivate people between Tallinn and Ljubljana and to persuade them that their sacrifices, their achievements and their endurance over the last 15 years were anything other than futile."
"We should all be ashamed of the way in which certain participants in the summit behaved."
"If the founding fathers had behaved as they did, there would have been no united Europe, and half a billion Europeans would never have known peace, freedom and prosperity."
"Europe will change and continue to develop, just as it did after the French National Assembly rejected the European Defence Community."
"For my part, I can do no other than hope that the changes that this continent will undergo and experience over the years to come will show no trace of the pettiness and egoism that caused the last European Council to fail."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, all Presidencies preside, but do not decide."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has indeed presided."
"It has drafted many constructive proposals, and it has managed to produce honourable compromises on a number of topics."
"The Lisbon Strategy has been relaunched and the national parliaments have finally become more sensitive to this grand European objective."
"The Stability and Growth Pact will be more intelligent, as it is adapted to economic cycles."
"The broad economic policy and employment guidelines have been agreed for three years."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has been able to move the EU forward regarding subjects as varied as increased commitment to the Millennium Goals, more targeted support for rural development and notable advances with regard to police cooperation and to security at external borders, etc."
"The very positive record of the Presidency has been overshadowed by the festival of national egos celebrated at the end of the week by one Head of State and certain Heads of Government."
"I have had the opportunity to say in this forum that the EU is currently sadly lacking in statesmen."
"It is governed by political gnomes busy jealously guarding their small treasure."
"Very few leaders have a true political vision of the future of Europe."
"Mr Juncker is not one of them."
"He is both an architect and a plumber."
"Politics has sometimes led me to oppose my Prime Minister, but I sympathised with him when he declared his shame faced with the mean-minded arrogance of some of his counterparts in the rich countries."
"Yes, Europe suffers from internal contradictions."
"There are those who push for greater political integration and those who simply want one huge market."
"Europe is in crisis."
"Etymologically, the Greek word means ‘decision’."
"The time for a decision has come; we have to choose: more Europe, or the opt-out."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to move Europe forward, and it deserves well of Europe."
"In six months, we will assess the new Presidency, but Mr Blair will have to present us with something other than a pseudo-modernist discourse on the need for structural reform."
"Yes, the world is changing."
"Europe has to adapt."
"Any community that does not have close links to employment, salaries and productivity becomes unfair, however, and, at the end of the day, becomes poorer."
"I have just quoted Carlos Fuentes."
"The economy must continue to serve social well-being, and solidarity must be the keyword of European politics."
"Europe will either be social or will not be at all, Madam President."
"Madam President, Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, there are few politicians who succeed in presenting European integration, sacrifices included, among the positive objectives of politics, in founding real agreement on hopes, and not on fears, and in making it understood that new global concerns can only be addressed at European level."
"I should like to thank Mr Juncker for his sincere efforts and the European passion that he has demonstrated."
"The applause of this House has shown that, among the cries of the Eurosceptics and the silence of the extreme pro-Europeans, we have encountered in you political intelligence and the vision of the greatest pro-Europeans."
"We would also like it if the other leaders of the Community institutions demonstrated the same courage and leadership in future."
"Let us remember, however, that a defeat is only a defeat when we accept it, and we must not accept it."
"We are faced with a difficult crisis, the most difficult for many years: first of all the referendum, and today the failed agreement."
"A Pandora’s box has been opened, exposing different visions of Europe."
"I should like to point out to all those debating the costs of Europe that, if we do not resolve the crisis soon, as the Cecchin report said almost 20 years ago, we will be talking about the costs of non-Europe, and the costs of non-Europe are higher than the costs of Europe."
"The contradiction between the tasks that we would like to give to Europe – in terms of global order, the economy and research – and the negotiations on the budget that Mr Juncker has outlined to us is therefore unsustainable."
"There will no longer be development or a social model if the Euro group does not address the issue of common economic policy alongside that of monetary policy."
"There will no longer be a Europe in the global disorder, if this Parliament and the countries ready to do so do not open a debate on enhanced cooperation on foreign policy and common security."
"This crisis will not be short-lived."
"The electoral calendar in Germany, in France and also in Italy, without mentioning others, does not help us."
"Time for reflection, however, ladies and gentlemen, cannot, and must not, become a Mexican siesta."
"I am addressing the President of Parliament and all of us: the referenda and the crisis involve us and affect us, but they have never questioned the work carried out by this Parliament in the constitutional triangle."
"In difficult times, our Parliament has been able to launch ideas and summon the European spirit."
"After years in which discussion has taken place on Europe for the people, it has to be us who must learn to communicate with the people."
"I should like to conclude by saying that this Parliament, always orderly, always working according to the rules and the schedule, must also demonstrate that it will not carry on with business as usual, and that we have understood both the unease of the people and the unsatisfactory responses of many governments."
"We will try to remember that the Commission will certainly be the custodian of the treaties, but that we are the representatives of the European people."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Luxembourg presidency for the good and pragmatic work it has done."
"I think more presidencies with such a pro-European attitude and less in the way of a pettifogging national outlook on the part of whatever government is at the helm would do us all a lot of good."
"In the aftermath of the summit, Europe is the subject of much negative language and sentiment."
"We did of course have something of a hangover in the first few days after it was over, and I am glad that our Prime Minister – in the Luxembourg parliament yesterday and in this House today – has regained his old form, and that we are aware of the need, more than ever, for a forward-looking and positive attitude to this Europe of ours."
"The crisis is made less profound by the fact that more members of the public than ever before are taking an interest in Europe, and there are two things that they want: they want more input into debates, and they want Europe’s actual policies to go in a different direction."
"As far as the new direction for European policy is concerned – and I see Mr Barroso looks to be already on the edge of his seat with anticipation – it is my view that, having presided over the Commission for a year, you really should think about to what extent your Commission’s decisions on Bolkestein, the Working Time Directive, REACH and climate change have helped to promote a positive attitude to Europe, or whether, on the other hand, they tend to turn even more members of the public against the Constitution."
"My final point is that, in Luxembourg, on 10 July, we will be campaigning for the Constitution."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be doing our bit to help get a ‘yes’, for Europe is not the problem, and this Constitution is not the problem, but rather the solution to our problem."
"Madam President, no is no."
"The Dutch ‘no’ is final."
"Those are not my words but of Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister, in today’s ."
"Following the Dutch and French voters’ rejection of the proposed text of the Constitution, most national governments are now opting for a time of reflection."
"Will this be a time for those in government to reflect on their tactics or will it offer the opportunity to change and improve the Constitution by means of a broad social discussion involving the general public and social organisations?"
"My party proposed a broad social discussion of this kind, and that proposal was adopted by the Dutch parliament; how will the Council help to ensure that there can be one across Europe?"
"Looking back, some advocates of the rejected text consider the no vote, above all, to be a vote against further enlargement to include countries with a low standard of living, particularly Turkey, and against financial solidarity with the poorest regions."
"It is probably far more important that many people feel angry about the differences that have grown over the years in terms of prosperity and input and about the uncertain future."
"They fear that Europe will increasingly resemble the USA."
"They are also indignant about projects that are vulnerable to fraud and about subsidies being poured into large agricultural companies."
"The unnecessary pumping of structural fund monies among the richest Member States is another cause of irritation."
"Does Mr Juncker agree with me that the neoliberal policy of emphasis on the market has helped foster opposition to this Constitution among the voters?"
"It is a good thing that last week, the Council did not make any hasty decisions about random cutbacks or the exclusion of new Member States."
"First of all, we must discuss what we want, about what Europe does and does not do."
"Studies can show that people do want to tackle the large-scale and cross-border issues in order to protect man and the environment more effectively, while they want minimal interference in national, regional and local democracy."
"Is the Council prepared to start such a study?"
"I would like a response to that."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with the impenetrable defences that were raised, the European Council ended in inconclusive chatter: in essence, a sinister death knell for this Europe, the Europe of bankers, which is so far removed from the dream of the patriots, the visionaries, the founding fathers of the European idea."
"In a few days’ time, it will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of Giuseppe Mazzini, a prophet of a Europe of the peoples, and the founder of the ‘Young Europe’ movementWhat is emerging from the discussions of the European Council is more reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna than of that great patriot’s vision of solidarity."
"The voice of the peoples must be heard, not the interests of high finance."
"It is the peoples that suffer, together with the real economy, as a result of the havoc and failures of the euro."
"So why not hold a referendum on the euro?"
"Instead, after having heard the results of the referenda, you write in your conclusions that the recent developments do not challenge the legitimacy of continuing the ratification process."
"Nothing changes."
"The bogus assumptions about this European integration, such as the claim that the nations of which it is composed, the body of this Europe, are disappearing, are therefore not taken into account."
"Fortunately, they have not disappeared: there is still a vestige of national sovereignty left."
"A lot has, however, been expropriated: monetary sovereignty has been expropriated, and, as a result of that, we want to give the decision on the euro back to the people, because the people very often say: enough of the euro."
"It is the Member States, the nations, that are the repositories of the democratic will of the citizens, not your technobureaucracy that is accountable to no one."
"Those discussions, that end of Europe is the result of your method of enlargement."
"Even Mr Prodi is now distancing himself from enlargement and from the decision on Turkey."
"It is a little too late, however."
"Madam President, the fiasco of the recent EU summit has left the European Union at a crossroads."
"No one should rejoice at this crisis, however, regardless of the reasons behind it."
"The Polish delegation to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group may well be opposed to the Constitutional Treaty, but this does not mean that we are opposed to the European Union itself."
"The latter is something we should all value."
"No one should make rash judgments either."
"One cannot help thinking, however, that even though the old Member States have quarrelled for years over whether priority should be given to structural reforms and more effective measures or to regulations that enhance social solidarity, the EU now appears to be saying that it has no interest in either efficiency or solidarity."
"Yet no one can claim that the recent EU enlargement is the cause of the crisis."
"No one should lay the blame on the new Member States, or on the 150 Polish plumbers working in France, who are in any case unable to meet the current demand for plumbing services in that country."
"The problems we are experiencing with regard to the new Financial Perspective do not boil down to a simple dispute over money."
"There is no longer any point in holding debates on the EU’s future on the basis of such obsolete ideological concepts as ‘liberalism’ or ‘social model’, because jobs cannot be created without growth."
"On the whole, the EU’s economies are over-regulated, and in addition, unemployment is not falling."
"Unless we want to escalate the crisis further, we must develop a job-creation strategy based on more effective action, enhanced competitiveness and higher incomes."
"There is another dimension to this crisis, namely the failure of the Constitutional Treaty."
"If its architects were keen to hear what the EU’s citizens had to say, then they have achieved their goal."
"The only problem is that the EU’s citizens have voiced their national opposition to a federal EU."
"The European project therefore needs to be thoroughly reconsidered, and the reforms must start from grass-roots level."
"Attempts by an all-seeing elite to bestow happiness on people by force always prove counter-productive."
"My final point relates to the common foreign policy, with regard to which people quite obviously have varying and divergent priorities."
"I say this in view of Mr Juncker’s comments on improvements in the EU’s relations with Russia."
"I would ask whether it is not the case that relations have improved because the EU has turned a blind eye to Russia’s impertinent treatment of Poland and the other new Member States."
"Unless the common foreign policy is to be devoid of any practical sense, it should seek to achieve a minimum level of security for all Member States, rather than to promote the interests of individual countries."
"I would have liked to have started by thanking Mr Juncker, but he is probably not interested in our opinions."
"Nevertheless, I would still like to say that I appreciate his stance in really trying to integrate the new Member States into the functioning of the European Union."
"I am sorry that the Luxembourg presidency will be connected with the failure of the Constitutional Treaty."
"I must say, however, that it is precisely the inability of the Council to deal with the current situation that demonstrates the necessity of the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Constitutional Treaty is not dead: it is, alas, the Council itself, unable to resolve this deadlock, that is dead and ineffective."
"Council members cannot agree, as they struggle to protect their political hides in the domestic arena."
"Today it is the European Parliament and the European Commission that know how to agree and adopt majority decisions."
"Both these institutions work and take decisions that directly affect the lives of the people of the European Union."
"It was stated during your presidency that the targets set by the Lisbon strategy are unrealistic."
"But the reality, that is, a proposed solution, was not offered to us, and remains a hot potato for the next presidency."
"And unfortunately not even the next presidency is a guarantee that the Lisbon strategy will be resolved rather than merely criticised."
"If Kissinger were to ask for Europe’s telephone number today, he would be given 25 numbers to choose from."
"Who to choose?"
"Big?"
"Rich?"
"Active?"
"It is exactly those who have now turned their backs on solidarity and on us all."
"Madam President, I in my turn would like to pay every homage to the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Listening to Mr Juncker, I was proud to belong to a Europe presided over by a man of such quality."
"You have shown that the authority of a Presidency can be measured by its willingness to place the common interest above its own national interest and it is on this criterion that, from tomorrow, we will judge your successor."
"I would like to add three comments on the financial perspectives."
"The first is that certain governments are calling for all the EU’s policies to be sent back to the drawing board, which is what the European Parliament did after the nine months of work by its temporary committee."
"Our Parliament has succeeded in making difficult choices between old policies and new ones."
"The Council could benefit from taking inspiration from this example."
"I am sure that the future Presidency will find food for thought in it."
"My second comment is that the lack of a position from the Council must not delay the implementation of the new cohesion policy or that of the new Framework Programme on Research."
"We propose to pursue legislation relating to the legal bases for the multi-annual policies so that those policies can enter into force on 1 January 2007."
"My third comment, finally, is that the Council has failed, not on the main subject of the level of budgetary expenditure, but on the method of financing a budget that has remained stable with respect to EU revenue."
"This confirms the analysis that we have made here right from the start."
"There can be no agreement on future expenditure without, at the same time, reform of the revenue system, and this subject is too important to be left just to the Ministers for Finance."
"Our Committee on Budgets invited the committees of the national parliaments to an initial exchange of views on this subject last week."
"We propose that the EU’s system of own resources should be examined in the context of an interparliamentary conference bringing together the European Parliament and the national parliaments to aid the governments in their search for the necessary compromise."
"Madam President, for the new Member States, these last six months have been a period rich in success, even if these successes were the fruit of some difficult compromises."
"Nevertheless, this period has also been rich in disappointments."
"We, too, have faith in the Lisbon Strategy, the key principle of which, solidarity, is one of the fundamental values for the European left."
"It is very important, even though we know that these last few days have not really been characterised by that solidarity."
"This period has also been an experience with regard to the functioning of relations between the European institutions."
"Despite the improvements, we are not completely satisfied with the role that Parliament has been able to obtain in this legally complicated and uncertain situation."
"Those who opposed the rapid ratification of the European Constitution did not take account of the fact that, at the same time, they were weakening the position of the European Parliament: the progress of the Constitution in that regard has been replaced by a permanent and complicated necessity for political compromises."
"However, the Luxembourg Presidency’s message was clear: no to a two-speed Europe, yes to a social Europe."
"Of the main starting objectives, the financial perspectives were not adopted."
"Despite the efforts of the new Member States, which were prepared to make many concessions during the Summit, the budgetary debate did not result in unqualified success."
"The President, though, has nothing to be ashamed of."
"Drawing conclusions from the last six months, I am convinced that we will continue to travel together down the European road."
"I would like to think that, in deciding the itinerary, the small countries will also have a contribution to make."
"Madam President, the EU is undoubtedly in crisis."
"The clear ‘no’ votes in the two referenda have plunged the whole of the EU into a kind of vacuum, with great uncertainty about the future."
"I am naturally sorry that the French and the Dutch rejected the Constitutional Treaty, but ‘no’ votes as clear as that must be respected."
"It would therefore be wise to stop and think and to devote some time now to analysis and listening and to reflection upon how we might move on so as to implement the reforms so badly needed by the EU."
"The crisis was of course exacerbated by the ‘budget fiasco’ but, in many ways, it is better to have no budget at all than a bad one."
"I do not think that this budget was especially modern."
"We cannot, however, put the whole of the EU in the deep-freeze and wait for the distrust felt by many towards the EU suddenly to disappear."
"More than ever, there is a need for leadership and for someone who dares to stand up for visionary ideals and for European cooperation and to defend the decisions taken in Brussels."
"In that context, the President-in-Office of the Council deserves all credit, partly for his candid speech and partly for his attempt to reconcile desires that are very much at odds with each other."
"We cannot allow the muggy haze that has descended over the whole of Europe to put a stop to cooperation."
"We have an enormous amount to do."
"We have the Lisbon process and the myth-enshrouded Services Directive, which are genuinely needed."
"We must combat cross-border crime."
"We have the ambitious environmental work involving REACH, and there is an enormous amount to do within the foreign policy field."
"The list of foreign policy measures – 33 pages of the Council’s conclusions – was certainly compiled before the Council meeting even began but nonetheless gives the appearance of high ambition and a large degree of unity, something that is extremely commendable."
"The EU has, and must continue to have, a large role to play in the surrounding world."
"I am concerned, however, about enlargement, which is passed over almost in silence in the conclusions from the Council meeting."
"We cannot use the referenda as pretexts for putting enlargement on ice in any way."
"The enlargement of just over a year ago to include ten new Member States is a brilliant success for the whole of the European idea."
"Unifying East and West is the best thing we have done."
"The European home, which does not at the moment perhaps feel so warm and cosy, must be open to our neighbouring countries when they fulfil the necessary requirements."
"We cannot convey the impression of the enlargement process too being put on hold and of their having to wait."
"In many ways, Europe is the answer to what is at issue in these countries, even if it does not perhaps quite appear to our own people to be the answer to their questions."
"Soon, it will be the summer recess for all our institutions."
"There is perhaps more need than ever to take a few weeks’ rest, to pause for reflection and to reflect upon how we are to move on."
"I believe that, in the long run, something good will prove to have come out of this crisis."
"Europe is worth it, but in that case we must really make an effort and ensure that the current hiatus in the ratification process does not also extend to the whole of European cooperation, for that would be disastrous."
"Madam President, Mr Schmit, I do not know whether you can find space at the front there for all the flowers with which this House is bedecking you today."
"I echo all the gratitude that has been expressed, and wish to add another bloom for the courage that this presidency, the government of Luxembourg, has displayed by organising the referendum and pressing on with the ratification process."
"It may be, Mr Schmit, that the result of this decision will be that there will one day be only one founding state in a politically united Europe rather than six of them, and that country will be little Luxembourg."
"It may be that this decision represents the victory of the idea of a politically united Europe over the vulgar idea of a common market, of the ideal of uniting people over the mere claim to be uniting markets, market forces and resources."
"Today and tomorrow see two Europes meeting head-on in this Chamber."
"The President-in-Office gave us a thoughtful speech, reminding us of the case for a political Europe."
"Tomorrow we will hear someone who broadcasts abroad for all to hear the propaganda of a Europe of nationalism and national corridors of power, adducing also the Rumsfeld formula according to which Europe is divided into ‘old’ and ‘new’, and thereby taking us back to the 19th century, to a Europe characterised by balances of power, by struggles for might, by competition, nationalistic egoism and hegemonistic politics, to a Europe that is not ours."
"I hope that the referenda will not be misinterpreted and will not be turned on their heads in such a way that their outcomes can be used against the public, but that they will be used in the manner in which they were intended, as a means of moving Europe forward."
"– Madam President, I really appreciate Mr Juncker and, when I think that he will be succeeded by Mr Blair, I appreciate him even more."
"My political group, in contrast to the petty interests and demagogy of Mr Blair and a number of others, wants a stronger Community budget."
"We want a Europe with ambitions and solidarity for its citizens: more united, stronger, more social, more democratic and with a stronger European Parliament."
"We say a clear 'no' to neoliberalism, to regressing into ethnocentricity, to the conversion of the Union to a free trade zone."
"It is unthinkable that the message of the 'no' from the peoples of France and the Netherlands should be ignored."
"The Community budget, which some consider to be overly high, accounts for a mere 2.5% of the Member States' public spending."
"It has increased over the last seven years by a mere 8%, while national budgets have increased by 23%."
"That is why concessions in the face of the coercive tactics of the Six must stop."
"Madam President, I was surprised to find out about the initial steps that were taken towards reflection within the European institutions."
"It is disappointing to see how various Heads of Government throw their entire weight behind a text that has, to all intents and purposes, been thrown out, thus needlessly obstructing the reflection on Europe’s future."
"Moreover, the Summit of 16 and 17 June clearly underlines the collapse of this Constitution."
"The optimistic references to a common destiny in the preamble ring false in the ears of someone from a country that, while supposedly fat and stuffed to the gullet, refuses to do anything for poor countries."
"In that sense, a reflection on the subject of ‘diplomatic choice of words’ is of primary importance for Paris."
"Moreover, theimpasse surrounding the EU’s multi-annual budget cannot be seen in isolation from the current institutional crisis in Europe."
"The discussion about the EU’s future budget is closely related to the debate about the European Constitution."
"It is impossible, and indeed undesirable, to indicate policy priorities in a new multi-annual budget and to allocate funds to them while the reflection period and the reformulation of the EU’s mandate are still in full swing."
"The European Union must take the public’s objections about the speed and course of the European integration process seriously."
"The citizens want sound European cooperation in respect of which national interests are not immediately labelled as selfish or nationalistic."
"The public wants a Europe that does not get caught up in federal dreams but that tackles cross-border issues dynamically."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the Italian Socialists of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"As we had cause to highlight before the Council, clear and urgent decisions on the strategy for the forthcoming years are needed for Europe."
"A fundamental choice needs to be made between the Baltic perspective, the Mediterranean perspective or a balanced mix of the two; a decision needs to be made on whether or not to actually pursue the Lisbon objectives by means of practical and coherent measures; the foundations on which political integration is to be established need to be redefined; and courage is required to clearly aim at a free and competitive economic system and system of social organisation, which can cope with the ongoing processes of globalisation."
"We furthermore believe that actions promoting the creation of a common European spirit are essential, as it can only be created by means of a gradual and progressive harmonisation of policies and by means of a debate designed to generate interest, involving the citizens, civil society and the social partners."
"A fresh challenge, a large-scale commitment, an ambitious course of action, rightly begun by the Luxembourg Presidency, which will be continued by Mr Blair."
"Madam President, I hope that Minister Schmit can hear me, because I would like to say that what the citizens are demanding now, quite rightly, is greater transparency."
"I believe that the President of your government was expressing everybody's feelings when he said quite clearly that he felt ashamed."
"It is incredible that certain Member States should make all kinds of statements of a Europeanist nature, saying that they want more Europe inside and outside our borders, while at the same time they demand a drastic reduction in their contribution to the Union’s budgets."
"It is not acceptable for certain governments to complain about their net contribution to the European Union without taking account of their commercial balance with the other Member States."
"The case of Germany in relation to certain Member States, such as my own, Spain, speaks volumes."
"Germany's net deficit with the European Union is less than my country’s commercial deficit with, in fact, Germany."
"Neither is it acceptable, Mr Schmit, that certain Heads of Government should say one thing within the Council and then say something quite different to the media in their countries."
"I would therefore like to ask whether it is true that there have even been certain Member States that have promised their support in the final vote and have then changed their minds and voted against."
"I would ask you to respond."
"It is precisely because of cases such as this, and regardless of what is laid down in the draft Constitutional Treaty, that debates in the Council must be made transparent, however shameful they may be."
"Finally, Minister, I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10th."
"Madam President, I would like firstly to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the efforts and imagination it has applied to trying to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives in the European Council."
"We have seen once again that the European leaders have not been a match for the circumstances: they have been unable to go beyond their exercise in national accounting, and at a crucial moment of crisis, they have been unable to show any positive sign of a forward-looking political vision."
"The Commission has done its job; as has the European Parliament: it has adopted its position by a large majority and, for the first time in its history, showing responsibility and taking account of the economic difficulties faced by certain Member States, it has proposed slightly lower figures than those proposed by the Commission."
"Both the Commission and Parliament have done their duty."
"On the other hand, the Council is having increasing difficulties adopting a position and this is regrettable since it leads to a lack of leadership which undermines the foundations of European integration and confidence amongst the citizens."
"I would like to point out that our group will stand by its commitments and that, if no financial perspectives are forthcoming, it will fully apply the provisions of Article 272 of the Treaty and will try to establish annually the figures that this Parliament has approved with a view to guaranteeing Community action."
"We still want to make progress with European integration and we therefore need the resources that this House has indicated in its capacity as budgetary authority."
"Let us be serious, representatives of the Council: it is not possible at the last minute to say that we must change the Union’s spending philosophy, it is not possible to advocate that we must spend more money on policies which create more added value and less on agriculture."
"What were certain people thinking in October 2002, when they approved the spending for the period we are dealing with?"
"We must respect the commitments we have made."
"For the Socialist Group, and for the Council as well, I hope, the Lisbon Strategy and, hence, economic and social cohesion, are the mid-term development objective."
"We would be delighted to have many more resources, we are aware of the achievements of governmental cooperation in relation to the Lisbon objectives."
"I would therefore like to point out that all policies ultimately find their expression in the budget."
"If the financial perspectives offer any added value, it consists of safeguarding and guaranteeing the programming of the Union’s cohesion policies, which, apart from being a mechanism for solidarity and for correcting territorial imbalances, are the most important Community public instrument, and are able to generate investment, economic growth and employment, and hence attract the citizens to the European project."
"Gentlemen of the Council — and I say gentlemen because there are no ladies — on behalf of my Group, I would ask you to show responsibility."
"The ‘no’ in the referenda and the lack of agreement in the Council are simply two sides of the same coin."
"Madam President, last week’s European Council was a great disappointment."
"No agreement could be reached on its own view regarding the new financial perspective, although the current one is due to expire next year."
"Accordingly, it is an urgent matter to establish a new one."
"The European Parliament decided on its own position at the start of June."
"That decision was reached after a full examination of all the EU’s main policy areas."
"That is why Parliament’s conclusions are clear and sound."
"The summit discussions were dominated by the quarrel between Great Britain and France over Britain’s rebate and the EU’s agricultural policy."
"Rarely, hardly ever in fact, have the Member State’s shares of net contributions become such dominant issues as now."
"Perhaps the only solution to the argument is to be found in the joint financing of agricultural subsidies, which Parliament is hinting at."
"Its gradual implementation at the same time as a reduction in Great Britain’s rebate could create an adequate basis for a compromise."
"The EU needs an interinstitutional agreement on the financial framework."
"Without one, we could of course draw up an annual budget on the basis of Article 272 of the Treaty, but it will not guarantee sustained and balanced development of the different policy areas."
"Most multi-annual programmes will be discontinued at the end of 2006."
"Of these, the main ones concern regional and structural policy, rural development, research and development policy, and many other areas."
"The new legislative plans for these areas are now being debated in Parliament, but it is difficult to make the final decisions when one does not know how much will be available in the form of appropriations."
"The situation seems to become especially problematic with regard to the one issue that really is the focal point of the financial perspective, which is increased competitiveness."
"The intention is to treble research and development funds for growth and employment, the funding of training programmes, and Trans-European networks."
"The situation mow seems quite wretched."
"The funding would already have been halved in the proposals for a compromise, and now we do not have any finance policies at all."
"Regional and structural policy also demands a solution."
"When financing for the present programming period was decided at the Agenda 2000 talks in Berlin, just six months before that period began, the outcome was that structural policy should be put on hold for nearly three years."
"The Member States and the Commission did not have time to draw up and adopt the programmes faster."
"Now the situation is still more difficult, as we have 10 new Member States for which it is a problem even to estimate the extent of future structural and cohesion policy."
"The next country to hold the presidency, Great Britain, cannot expect to while away the time doing nothing: we expect it to come up with proposals and solutions."
"Madam President, to prove Europe is really united we have to listen to what European people are telling us."
"For the first time in the process of the construction of the EU, there has been a big difference – in France and in the Netherlands – between the proposals of the elected representatives and the will of the majority of citizens."
"We are pro-European, we want a united Europe and we are working for it, but we the Catalans and other Europeans from stateless nations do not believe that we are going in the right direction on some issues."
"We cannot forget a stateless nation’s rights as a part of the human, cultural, language and citizenship rights that are needed for the united Europe that we want to build."
"Nowadays we have to listen and learn: learn from old mistakes, such as trying to build a European Union only on nation states; and listen to European citizens."
"It could be that new EU Member States understand Members from stateless nations very clearly."
"Most of the new Member States are new European states, but with a wild history like ours."
"We all need to build new bridges and deal with new ideas to implement a European Union where everyone could be fully recognised."
"If we continue going the wrong way; if we persist only in the Jacobinical model, the European Union will not succeed."
"– Madam President, the Council does not have the courage to bury the Treaty."
"How can we talk of putting something off when it has already been killed off? There can be no resurrection for something that cannot be saved."
"The Council also lacks vision."
"Its President’s frankness only serves to show in stark relief the truth hidden from Europe by its governments."
"A prisoner of national egos, the Council has no political ambition of its own and tries to make omelettes without breaking eggs."
"With that shopkeeper mentality, we are doomed to fail."
"With the French vote, there is a before and an after."
"Either Europe wants to be purely a market or it endeavours to dig deeper and move forward by paying careful attention to the social reasons behind the referenda."
"Public opinion is the most significant new element to emerge from this crisis. This new player does not want less Europe, but, rather, more and better Europe."
"The answer is not to stop, but, rather, to have the courage to initiate a fresh, genuinely democratic, constitutional process; the answer is not to head down a cul-de-sac, but, rather, to have a Europe that is provided with its own resources and that is characterised by greater solidarity and a greater ability to combat unemployment."
"Madam President, the referenda in France and the Netherlands and last week’s summit genuinely revealed the European project as an elite project without grass-roots support."
"Calling the people’s decision a crisis clearly demonstrates a genuine lack of belief in a democratic Europe."
"We must now state that the draft Constitution has come to nothing according to the EU’s own rules."
"Two founder countries have already rejected it."
"The matter is clear, so the question is: what shall we do now?"
"In my view, we must arrange a new Convention that must be appointed democratically so as to reflect the peoples’ opinions on this issue and not the elite’s."
"Three different issues must not then be mixed up, as has now happened."
"It was an attempt to impose upon the people of Europe something they did not want."
"Firstly, there is a need to edit together treaties that have already been entered into so that they are clear and easy to understand. That is no great political issue."
"Rather, it is just a matter of simple editing. Secondly, we must revise the form to be taken by the rules for decision-making in those areas in which we have already said that we must take joint decisions."
"Thirdly, the draft Constitution included all sorts of plans for common defence, a common foreign policy and a host of other things that absolutely should not have been addressed in this context."
"Such issues should not be included in what looks like a Constitution. Instead, these are issues for the people of Europe to debate in the future."
"We must begin again from the beginning, show respect for the people’s decision and then review that decision from a democratic point of view with democratically elected people in the form of a Convention."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main reason for reviewing the course of any presidency of the EU Council seems to be to gain an opportunity for mutual appreciation by the people at the top of the EU’s political establishment."
"That sort of thing will not, however, do anything to help get Europe through the doubly grave crisis in which it finds itself."
"What makes the crisis dual in nature is the fact that, on the one hand, the referenda in France and the Netherlands have shown evident and massive public rejection of the way the EU is going at present, irrespective of domestic political concerns, while, on the other, the failure of the summit has shown that, even at Council level, among the Heads of Government, the will towards a common way forward cannot be assumed."
"What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it."
"That having been said, this crisis should afford the opportunity for a radical change of direction, for a reorientation of the way Europe is going."
"Let us get away from a Union characterised by the egoisms of bureaucrats, lobbyists and technocrats with no knowledge of the people; let us move on to a Europe of self-determining peoples and mature citizens."
"That is what the opportunity for radical change ought to mean."
"Madam President, for the first time in my life I find myself in the strange position of agreeing at least in some respects with Tony Blair."
"I believe he is right to call for a fundamental reform of the way the EU is funded, with particular focus on the common agricultural policy."
"It cannot be right that in a Union of 25 Member States, 42 per cent of our budget goes to the CAP, while less than 4 per cent of our workforce work in agriculture."
"Nor can it be right that although the CAP cake has to be shared between 25 Member States, one country gets a gigantic 23.4 per cent slice."
"How can we tolerate a system that sees the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, sitting in session here in Brussels, demanding quite correctly ever more draconian regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products that kill half a million of our citizens every year, while across the corridor the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is happily voting for an annual subsidy to Europe’s tobacco farmers of more than EUR 1 billion?"
"Reform, however, is needed across a much wider field than simply the CAP."
"The people of France and the Netherlands showed us that we have lost touch with our own electors."
"It was a valuable lesson that we would do well to learn."
"Our brave words about achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, about facing up to the challenges of globalisation, about increased competitiveness and economic reform are never matched by brave deeds."
"We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive; we voted in this House to end the opt-out on the Working Time Directive, and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives: more red tape, more bureaucracy, more interference in the lives of our citizens."
"Do we really believe that this will increase our competitive advantage in the global market?"
"Do we think this will achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy?"
"I do not think so."
"It was a wake-up call from the French and the Dutch."
"Wake up and smell the coffee!"
"Madam President, Mr Juncker expressed his regret at having to give up being President-in-Office of the Council after only six months."
"If the Constitution were in force, he would be able to be elected for two and a half years."
"Perhaps the summit has shown how important it is that the Council should develop in that direction."
"I am very pleased that the summit decided, not on a Plan B, which would involve halting the ratification process and re-negotiating the text, but on a Plan D, which involves proceeding with ratification while continuing with a debate – the great debate about Europe."
"You, Vice-President Wallström, now have in your hand the key that will unlock communication with the public in relation to the European project."
"This is the right strategy, and I wholeheartedly endorse it."
"I hope that the referendum in Luxembourg will be a success, for we will then have two popular ‘yes’ votes against two ‘no’ votes, which might give the go-ahead for agreement to the Constitution."
"We now need to debate what the EU is for and why we need it."
"The topics for debate are obvious, including as they do the role of the EU in globalisation, the exit routes from the economic and employment crisis, the EU’s frontiers and the question of how much wider we may set them, not to mention transparency and democracy within the EU."
"What I saw as missing from the summit resolution was any concept of how the debate should be structured."
"It is not enough to have 25 national debates in isolation from each other."
"We have to bring them together and create a synthesis right across the EU."
"If Giscard d’Estaing’s idea of a Congress of Peoples had not been blown out of the water after being proposed to the Convention, I would almost regard it as a good idea to hold an ad hoc assembly of the European Parliament and the national parliaments on that sort of platform."
"I hope in any case, though, that what comes out of this crisis will be a stronger Europe and a Europe closer to its people."
"Madam President, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency will be remembered for having coincided with external events, which, although forcing the European project to undergo a genuine crisis, will enable the European Union to redefine its mission and to endow it with intelligence, institutions, organisation and resources."
"That does not diminish our sense of gratitude towards you."
"The solution to global problems of the past, a past in which, for us, the world and Europe were the same thing, enables us to state that that period of European history has definitely come to an end, as a result of the success achieved."
"The way in which every issue is now rapidly globalised obliges us to embark upon another period, which is just as challenging, not to say just as exciting."
"The achievement of peace and stability within Europe, the prosperity ensured by the construction of the internal European market through successive enlargements, and the fostering of the very many cultures within Europe, which can all be traced back to common Judaeo-Greco-Christian roots, make the founding fathers’ original project substantially complete, even if the full and necessary involvement of south-eastern Europe is still absent."
"Today, the same issues – peace, prosperity and identity – can only be resolved on an international scale, with global actors demanding a European actor that is equal to the task, more unified, more integrated, more directly accountable towards the European people, without unnecessary, if not downright harmful intermediation by the Member States, and, for that very reason, able to guarantee the objectives that the European people believe are no longer achievable with the Union of today."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has done its best to mitigate the impact of external events, despite the bleak economic situation in many of the largest Member States and the difficult employment conditions, and despite a Council of 25 operating in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Nice and a Commission that is still not fully able to instil Community life into the work of the Union."
"The defence of the fundamental completeness of the Stability and Growth Pact, the stimulus to ratify the Constitutional Treaty, the open-handed and determined search for agreement on the budget, and the impetus provided by the Lisbon Strategy are facts that remain, to the credit of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"Above all, however, the Luxembourg Presidency has taught us that the Union, in anticipation of more appropriate constitutional procedures, such as those laid down by the Constitutional Treaty, has to utilise every political resource in order to keep the process in balance, whilst allowing itself time to refocus on the fundamental objectives and methods of its own work."
"Without giving in to a state of panic, without preventing itself from continuing to utilise the existing treaties in order to protect and to increase the European of common decisions, even starting with only apparently modest results, such as the European driving licence, which I hope can be approved in a few days’ time thanks to our codecision procedure."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council said that Europe ought to have shown some maturity."
"If anyone or anything has shown itself lacking in maturity, it is not Europe, but the Council, which has brought discredit upon itself as a legislative institution, and it is high time that we compel it to meet in public, which might perhaps be some help."
"Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, is now calling for a radical reform of agricultural policy."
"We are ready for it."
"His demand, though, is a hypocritical one, for he was among those who put the brakes on the last time there was a reform, when he prevented direct payments from being capped or staggered."
"He blocked the social cohesion that the coupling of premiums to each worker would have achieved."
"He prevented, and voted against, the reallocation of funds to the second pillar for innovation, work and the environment and for the economic development of rural areas."
"What that boils down to is that his flagging up of agricultural policy is retribution for the demand – which most of us do in any case support – that the rebate be brought back onto the agenda."
"Mr President, when Mr Juncker came to this Parliament in January to set out his presidency’s priorities, the UK Independence Party reminded him that he had spoken about a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate."
"We pointed out that Mr Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate."
"I do not know whether Mr Juncker was being naive or arrogant, but last week he counted the cost of it."
"It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary, thereby falling into a trap laid by President Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ‘no’ vote."
"In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be."
"His window of opportunity was almost closed, the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency."
"Mr Juncker is right about one thing: the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm."
"I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes."
"His quote, ‘I want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treaty’, will go down in history as being typical of the attitude of the EU’s political elite in the 21st century."
"I come from Devon, where we are often referred to as simple country folk."
"Despite – or perhaps because of – my simplistic outlook on life, I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand."
"It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence, you have to vote ‘no’."
"Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonian’s ability to understand it."
"What part of the word ‘no’ does Mr Juncker not understand?"
"Mr President, for those who still cling to the European dream, Mr Juncker’s presidency has been a stunning failure."
"Under it the precious Constitution has been shipwrecked on the rocks of rejection and the budget is an unmitigated shambles, with rancour, as in Mr Juncker’s speech today, being its currency."
"From this, however, some good could come."
"If the effect was to jolt European leaders into the same reality stream that many of their people already occupy, then a workable Europe could emerge."
"Root and branch changes are essential, in which the primacy of the nation state should be reestablished and Brussels centralisation reversed, with wide-ranging powers repatriated to national governments and parliaments."
"A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit, and not for the unworkable, unwanted ever-closer union, has some hope of success."
"This present Europe, as your presidency demonstrates, Mr Juncker, cannot work."
"– Mr President, given my institutional role in the European Parliament, I should be speaking about the failure of the Brussels summit in relation to cohesion, a failure which saddens us all and creates problems with the timely start of the programmes for the new period, for 2007-2013, in connection with the Community Support Framework and regional policy."
"However, the debate, on the initiative in particular of one country, has opened up and gone beyond the bounds of the predefined Brussels agenda."
"For example, the subject of the common agricultural policy has been raised."
"I wonder why those who raised the subject were unable to raise it in 2002 when they signed off everything to do with the CAP and the agricultural budget up to 2013."
"I wonder if they would all be prepared to set an example by cutting back the budgets for their large-scale farmers."
"The south of Europe cannot pay for the costs of enlargement, nor can the previous cohesion countries."
"The subject of a new model for Europe has also been raised, but every model for Europe requires financing."
"More Europe also means more money."
"We cannot talk about a new vision for Europe with just 2.5% of public spending at European level making up the Community budget."
"What Europe needs today more than ever is bold and visionary leadership; leadership which looks to future generations, rather than to future elections."
"Our political leadership should not present Europe either as a 'coat hanger' for its responsibilities or as a necessary evil."
"We must show the citizens what Europe really is: a decision in favour of peace, cooperation, development and social cohesion."
"Commissioner, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, first of all, it is my turn to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for its efforts and, above all, for its method, which was respectful of the institutions and very democratic."
"I think that, in the years to come, whenever the situation becomes difficult, we will refer to this method."
"Having said that, it is with real bitterness that I now address you following this summit and its result regarding, in particular, the financial perspectives."
"Far be it from me to be provocative, but I am personally embarrassed and even ashamed at the image of national egotism presented by some European states."
"Overly attached to their historical advantages, they have been taught a valuable lesson in Europe by the new countries."
"Once again, the Council has illustrated a political adage from Corrèze: promises only bind those who believe in them."
"The citizens, though, are starting to no longer believe."
"Gentlemen of the Council in passing, I would point out that there were very few women there and I think that parity within the Council would bring progress in the political habits of that institution  so, gentlemen of the Council, what has become of your commitments to boost growth and innovation so that everybody can find a good job, a place in our society?"
"Keeping your word is doubtless an antiquated, outmoded virtue, but, at the foot of the budgetary wall, the Council’s word disappeared into thin air."
"What we were afraid of in Parliament, therefore, happened in the Council."
"The resolution that we broadly adopted, though, was very moderate in view of our projects and, over seven years, enabled certain policies to be developed realistically."
"That is my only satisfaction as an MEP and as a European citizen."
"We in Parliament are prepared to continue negotiations with the European Council as soon as it has its feet back on the ground, but above all when it has resumed the progression of a true political project."
"Each country still needs to be convinced that the added value that we gain as 25 Member States is much greater than our contributions to the European budget."
"Our European utopia does exist, but it needs a broader, more generous, more ambitious, more humanist vision with greater solidarity, shared by the citizens and respected by the Council, so that, together, we can confront reality and future challenges."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this first half-year has been especially full of major challenges for the future of the European Union: the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the relaunch of the Lisbon Agenda, the ratification of the Constitution and the financial perspectives."
"The Luxembourg Presidency, in its commendable effort to address them all, has confirmed its own political ability and its determined support for the Community project. It then suffered an unfortunate setback in the European Council last Thursday and Friday, which, without doubt, does not help Europe to build an effective relationship with the citizens, a relationship that is genuinely based on the element of trust."
"I must, however, add, Minister, that I was not so impressed with the position of the current Presidency on the resources for the cohesion policy in the next programming period."
"With regard to the original, very restrictive proposal, a step forward was made at the start of the summit, which I personally do not believe was satisfactory, and which, in fact, if it were translated into an agreement, would not have provided an adequate response to the demands for balanced development in the regions lagging behind."
"Parliament, however, had sent out a significant positive signal by approving the Böge resolution by a large majority and by reaching full agreement with the position of the European Commission."
"Is it possible that all of that is of no importance whatsoever?"
"Is it possible, therefore, not to take account of the opinion of 426 – that was how many of us voted – democratically elected Members?"
"Personally speaking, I hope – and I conclude – that after last week’s unpleasant test, a balanced agreement is reached, mindful of the prevailing positions, and that that occurs as soon as possible, without indulging in the extended time still available."
"Mr President, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats’ coordinator on our parliamentary steering group for the Lisbon strategy, I should like to start by expressing a degree of satisfaction."
"Satisfaction about the fact that under the Luxembourg Presidency, the Lisbon strategy was given another shot in the arm and can really get underway now that this last, particularly tricky summit has approved the integrated guidelines."
"What this shows is that social cohesion, sustainable development and the new emphasis on growth and jobs remain priorities shared by the three institutions."
"We know that the Member States play a leading part in this strategy, now and in future, but also that Europe has a task of its own."
"In order to be able to carry out our part of the bargain, we need money; the failure to reach agreement on the financial package means that this is not, or is in any case insufficiently, forthcoming."
"It is shameful for various reasons, which have been explained here by others, certainly in respect of the new Member States."
"What is particularly unfortunate is the embarrassing manner in which the lack of political will to further develop the European Union together was exposed."
"And to develop it into what?"
"Let us make good use of the active period of reflection, which we do, after all, have at our disposal."
"We should use that time to turn the European Union once more into a project with visible added value, added value for all those people who worry about their jobs, who worry about their companies relocating and who are frightened by immigration."
"People who find the EU’s enlargement too much to handle because they were given far too little information in their own countries and who also fear the globalisation process, which they do not know to be guided in one way or another."
"Should there be a supreme being, should Zeus still be around, he should be able to fall in love with Europa once again."
"I think we should ensure that we offer the people a Europe of that kind, a Europe with charisma, a Europe that is attractive once more."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is now coming to an end."
"I am sure that I speak for many when I say that I continue, even once June is past, to count on your commitment and your conviction."
"I also think that I speak for many, Mr Juncker, when I say that we are grateful for your transparency and your honesty."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to begin by commending the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency on their endeavours to prevent the European Council disaster."
