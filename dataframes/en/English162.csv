"Incidentally, the contract represented by the CAP was called into question for good measure, but none of that mattered very much, if I may venture to say so."
"Now, ' Madman II' begins with the discovery, at the back of a drawer, of ECU 500 million."
"There will, incidentally, be ECU 117 million for France."
"So much the better, glad to hear it, nothing against that."
"The only problem, if I can put it like this, is that we are beating about the bush, or rather the bull, shirking the question of responsibility."
"This is a political problem, not a technical, budgetary one."
"It is a problem of identifying the people responsible and holding them liable."
"First, there is the responsibility of the meal manufacturers."
"I've said it before and I say it again, we know who was poisoning the whole of Europe."
"It was Demulder Brothers of Doncaster, Yorkshire."
"Incidentally, a small delegation from the committee of inquiry went to meet with Demulder Brothers."
"Those people should have helped to compensate for the damage they caused."
"Then there is the responsibility of the British Government, which said nothing and let them get on with it. All it did was to prohibit those meals in its own territory in 1988, but allowed them to be exported so that they could poison others!"
"Then there is the responsibility of the British Members of Parliament."
"We saw them in action here yesterday. They are fantastically keen-sighted, able to see from 40 metres away whether another Member is voting once or twice or three times."
"With that vision, how did they fail to see that there were 160, 000 cattle dying?"
"How did the eagleeyed Mr Ford and the others fail to spot that mountain of dead cattle poisoned by their own meal?"
"Another case of the proverb of the beam and the mote."
"Well, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously we're all for this additional 500 million, but we still need, thanks especially to the committee of inquiry which refused to take evidence from Mr Delors - and that would take some doing, incidentally - we still need finally to pluck up courage to tackle the central problem: whose fault is it?"
"And let the poisoners pay!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I am sure you know, and as has indeed already been mentioned, at its meeting of 28-30 October in Luxembourg, the Council agreed on a package of emergency measures for the beef and veal sector."
"In view of the continuing problems, in the context of this package additional direct income support for producers or the beef and veal market amounting to ECU 500 million was considered to be warranted."
"With the regulation which is before you, the Commission has fulfilled its obligation to establish a legal basis for achieving that objective."
"Hence the proposal provides for an additional support package of ECU 500 million for the beef and veal sector."
"Each Member State will receive its share of the 500 million package in accordance with a distribution key which has also already been agreed in Luxembourg."
"It is being left up to the Member States to decide whether to use their share of the aid to support producers' incomes or in a more concentrated way, to support the beef and veal sector in general."
"We hope that in this way the financial support will reach those worst affected by the crisis."
"I should like to conclude by thanking Parliament for treating this proposal as urgent, so that its opinion will be known before the next Council of Agriculture Ministers, which will meet on Monday and Tuesday of next week."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Common organization of the market in bananas"
"The next item is the report (A4-0337/96) by Mr Santini, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the common organization of the market in bananas (COM(96)0082 - C4/0233/96-96/0080(CNS))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, behind the technical and economic reasons underlying the need to reform Regulation 404/93, Mr Santini's report reveals numerous factors which undeniably contribute to complex sets of problems mingling social and employment policy, foreign policy and even matters arising from news stories or civil war."
"This derives especially from the economic importance of bananas, the leading commodity in the world fruit and vegetable economy."
"Three sources of supply characterize the form of the Union banana market: Community production, ACP production and production in dollar zone countries."
"On the balance between these three sources depend the future of the market and the destiny of many producing regions, but that balance is lacking."
"Today, the banana market is going through a deep-seated crisis."
"The oversupply of the Community market with bananas from the dollar zone has caused prices to collapse, the main sufferers being Community and ACP bananas, pressurized by two main factors: higher production costs and a weaker commercial organization."
"What we are seeing today, then, is an unequal struggle between a coalition of two big multinationals, aiming to monopolize the world market of which they already control 80 %, having previously monopolized the American market and invaded the European market to the extent of 70 %."
"An unequal struggle, then, between these two giants on the one hand and the European producers and their historical allies on the other."
"A market organization cannot attach priority to financial interests when such objectives are at stake."
"To provide the necessary protection, the following measures are essential. First, we must reject any increase in the quota beyond 2, 300, 000 tonnes; secondly, we must maintain a tariff quota capable of guaranteeing a minimum price; and thirdly, we must retain the present split which grants 30 % of the quota to Community and ACP banana operators, 66.5 % to the dollar zone operators and 3.5 % to the Latin American newcomers."
"If we accept an increase in the quota - an increase as high as 3 million tonnes has actually been proposed - or change the present split it would amount to delivering the European market into the hands of the American multinationals and so sealing the doom of Community production."
"In the interests of clarity and fairness, it is also necessary to revise the clause which provides that, when quotas are allocated, the two previous years should be taken into account if exceptional circumstances have had a heavy impact on the current season's production."
"It is unacceptable that, in that event, the policy of two weights, two measures should still be applied."
"Assessing the exceptional character of any disaster is left to the discretion of the Commission which, hitherto, has only regarded it as applying to damage caused by hurricanes."
"As far as Somalia is concerned, it can be argued that this country, still regarded as a traditional ACP State, has not ratified the Fourth Lom√© Convention."
"But who could have signed it, since the country was gripped by a civil war which has now reached the proportions of an endemic catastrophe?"
"Of the 60, 000 tonnes which had been assigned to it, Somalia has been able to guarantee barely one-third, and then under disastrous conditions of financial profitability."
"Before the common organization of the market in bananas was introduced on 1 July 1993, the market of the then twelve Member States was partitioned."
"This situation was incompatible with the introduction of the single market."
"To establish ground rules and harmonize the market, therefore, the European Union introduced the COM."
"That arrangement, ladies and gentlemen, derives from a compromise which respects the balance between the interests of the various sources of supply, while taking due account of the Union's prior commitments: Community preference, preferential access for ACP bananas and GATT rules for third countries."
"The accession of the three new Member States, all of which imported bananas from the dollar zone, was reflected by an increase in the quota by 350, 000 tonnes to allow for those countries' internal consumption. This allowance is now recognized to have been excessive."
"Without amending the Council Regulation on the COM in bananas, the Commission saw fit, during 1995, to increase the tariff quota for dollar zone bananas to 2, 553, 000 tonnes."
"Today, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is asking us to approve, apart from other minor points in the text, changes in two major areas which characterize the very existence of the COM in the banana sector: the tariff quota for the dollar zone and the distribution of import licences."
"On analysing the way in which this COM functions following these provisional changes, we regret to note the following facts: the volume proposed by the Commission in 1995 is excessive in terms of the European Union's consumption requirements, estimated at 4 million tonnes."
"If the Commission's proposal were to be ratified, the basic Regulation would permit the marketing of 4, 264, 700 tonnes, or approximately 265, 000 tonnes more than the European Union has the capacity to absorb."
"Even now, ladies and gentlemen, having regard to the statistics produced since the second half of 1995, whereas Caribbean production is 270, 000 tonnes below its authorized level because of natural disasters, the European market is in the grip of an unprecedented crisis, entirely attributable to a glut which is holding the market price in Europe down at its lowest ever level."
"This situation cannot continue, because it is seriously disrupting the economic equilibrium of the European regions of the French West Indies, and also of several ACP States whose social equilibrium depends primarily on the banana business."
"The crisis to which I refer, ladies and gentlemen, is a very real one where I come from, in Guadeloupe."
"As I speak, planters in Guadeloupe have abandoned their fields to occupy the port of Pointe-√†-Pitre, the key point in the island's fuel supply, and other strategic points, resulting in the virtual economic paralysis of the region."
"Their aim is to call attention to the difficulties they face as the situation continues to deteriorate, with the selling price of West Indian bananas below 2 francs a kilo as compared with a production cost of nearly 6 francs. The loss of income not compensated by the COM amounts, according to the growers, to 1.96 francs per kilo."
"The West Indian producers are no longer able to keep their business going."
"Some cannot even harvest their crops, because they are unable to pay their workers or buy packaging."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Community's producers are expecting a major political gesture from us today."
"They are hoping that the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on the banana crop and are now seriously at risk should be shown due consideration in our actions."
"They also expect category B import licences to be maintained at the level of 30 %, to enable them to retain their presence in the Community market as a whole, and they hope that the tariff quota assigned to third countries will help to restore equilibrium to the market."
"The application of the COM, which is a useful framework, has been reflected by a deterioration in the situation of the producers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is contrary to the spirit and letter of the CAP and the COM."
"Our production operations are struggling by comparison with bananas from the dollar zone in the entire European market."
"This, too, is contrary to the very principle of Community preference."
"Madam President, after 14 months we are again debating a proposal to modify the COM for bananas."
"In reality, the arguments put forward in October 1995 remain valid."
"So we support Mr Santini's report, especially in the terms set out by Mr Aldo a few moments ago and in line with the report approved by the Committee on Agriculture, which coincides with the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for which I am rapporteur."
"Certain new facts have arisen during 1996."
"As Mr Aldo said, there has been a surplus of bananas on the European market, causing prices to fall in some Member States, with serious damage to certain European regions, specifically the French overseas territories, and certain ACP countries."
"That should not surprise us given that the Commission had already been warned about it in this very forum."
"Furthermore, Ecuador and other countries, including the United States, have complained to the World Trade Organization."
"Bear in mind that the United States is not a banana-producer and is representing the interests - doubtless legitimate - of the American multinationals which trade in the banana-dollar."
"But the ACP countries have not been allowed to represent themselves as affected third parties, so they do not have an equal right to defend their legitimate interests."
"This situation violates the neutrality of the committee of experts and I want to emphasize that clearly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask for a vote in favour of the report approved in the Committee on Agriculture on the understanding that this is the best way to defend Community law and the interests of European and ACP banana production."
"Madam President, this European Community that we belong to is a little more complex than it might seem to be at first sight."
"For example, we have just approved a regulation providing aid to continental Community producers affected by the BSE crisis."
"But although the majority of the European population is found in what might be called central Europe or the European nucleus, the European Union also has certain regions which are a bit further away - the ultraperipheral regions - and I think Community solidarity requires that we also show support for these regions."
"Actually, several million inhabitants of the European Community live in these regions, and currently rely on a regulation in the banana sector which protects banana producers."
"Secondly, the banana regulation establishes protection for certain African, Caribbean and Pacific countries with which we have economic relations and which depend to a large extent on our protection."
"So the regulation on the common organization of the banana market is not an arbitrary regulation but is aimed at achieving equilibrium between producers in the ultraperipheral regional and producers in the rest of the Community."
"Any change in the established statute would greatly endanger the position of Community producers and producers in ACP countries with which we maintain relations. So I think we need to be very careful in introducing changes of this kind."
"Increasing the quotas every time there is an enlargement of the Community may effectively lead to the collapse of existing protection in the sector and even the disappearance of the current system."
"So the Socialist Group joins previous speakers in supporting the report from the Committee on Agriculture, and opposes any increase in the quotas and any other change which could endanger the current system for regulating the banana sector."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already spoken a number of times here in Parliament on the subject of the organization of the market in bananas, and perhaps I have sometimes conveyed my views rather forcefully."
"I think we must all acknowledge that we can achieve our aims in this matter only by means of a compromise, and that we have to abandon extreme positions if we are to reach agreement."
"I am pleased to be able to speak today, for the first time, on behalf of my Group, the Group of the European People's Party, and to be able to submit a proposal for a compromise which will make itself felt in the vote."
"It is not true that good bananas are produced in the ACP States and the European Union, and bad bananas in Latin America."
"The situation is not as clear-cut as that."
"Latin America too has small-scale producers who are hardhit by market regulation, because they do not have access to licences like multinational companies."
"We must take these small-scale producers into account."
"Therefore I ask you to vote in favour of Amendment No 12, which I have introduced jointly with a number of colleagues from many different States."
"To move on to the tariff quota, we have here two extreme positions, firstly the one which finds expression in Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which provides for a drastic increase in the tariff quota, way beyond the Commission proposal."
"This position is not so far-fetched, since it has also been adopted by a number of national delegations in the Council of Ministers."
"The other extreme position finds expression in Amendment No 6, put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, namely that the tariff quota be retained."
"It is true that we have a new situation here, since the three new Member States have hitherto imported only 'dollar' bananas."
"Thus we have two extremes."
"The PPE Group will vote against Amendment No 6, and the colleagues with whom I introduced Amendments Nos 10 and 11 will withdraw both these amendments."
"In the interests of a compromise, I ask the whole House to join in voting against Amendment No 6, so that we can really achieve unanimity on this difficult question."
"Madam President, we are by now used to the proposals to change the COM for bananas which translate a systematic permeability to the interests of huge American multinationals and, it must be said, some of the major Community importers, mainly German."
"Once again there is an attempt to destroy the existing balance struck in the share-out of the yearly import quotas, with once again an underhand attempt to include certain artificial types of crop, and a proposal for a continued and exaggerated increase in the levels of those quotas."
"In the past 2.2 million tonnes a year were accepted instead of the 2 million previously accepted; now there is a move to increase that to 2.533 million tonnes, reduced to 2.3 million in the Santini report (which we shall be voting for as an alternative to the previous figure although we still are not satisfied, since it accepts, albeit at lower figures, the principle of increasing the quota)."
"However we do not seem to have a reply to the increase in domestic consumption through a real policy of promoting internal production which could be possible and there is no proposal to increase the incomes of Community producers who are also poor and experiencing great difficulties, although those Community producers are, for the most part, from ultra-peripheral regions from which I should like to pick out, for example, the French Overseas Territories, the Canaries and Madeira."
"The proposals for a regulation that we have from the Commission are prejudicial against Community producers and ACP countries and overlook the principle of Community preference."
"The amendments to the Santini report seek to avoid this prejudice but still do not manage in our opinion to defend in full the interests of the Community banana."
"However we shall be voting for it unless Amendments Nos 10 or 11 are adopted since they propose a huge and inadmissible increase in the annual import quotas."
"We are sure that the European Parliament is not going to go off its head and approve them."
"Madam President, Mr Liese's suggestion that we should think of the smaller banana producers in Latin America is a sensible one."
"We have introduced a similar amendment."
"It does not matter too much which one is carried."
"But we do not agree with him on the subject of the quota."
"Three million tonnes is sheer nonsense."
"I am assuming that the committee's proposal will be accepted."
"However, it is much more important that the proportions allocated should remain the same with the new quantity."
"In the Commission proposal the so-called dollar bananas are granted 70 % (previously 66 %) and the bananas from the other group of countries 26 % (previously 30 %)."
"What matters here is that, whatever quota is arrived at, the quantities are allocated in the same way as before."
"I should like to address the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as follows: Mr Jacob, if this amendment is carried with the same shares as before, it is important for you, as chairman, to proceed to ask the Commission if it will accept this proposal, so that if it does not accept it, we can if necessary ask for the matter to be referred back to the committee; in this way we can force the Commission to engage in negotiations on the way in which the proportions are allocated."
"Mr President, speaking for myself, of course, but also speaking on behalf of my colleague Professor Castagn√®de, who is the greatest specialist in the banana market, I should like to express our firm rejection of the proposals made to us by the Commission and our equally firm support for the proposals submitted by our rapporteur."
"Let me remind the House of the principles on which the common organization of the market in bananas was based."
"First, Community preference."
"Secondly, preferential access for the ACP countries."
"And finally, but only finally, the GATT rules, the WTO rules as they are now, which apply to third country producers."
"I cannot help wondering whether those principles are even being respected in the quotas that apply today: 850, 000 tonnes for European production, 850, 000 tonnes for the ACP and 2, 200, 000 tonnes for the reduced rights quota."
"And now the Commission wants to make this situation worse."
"It proposes to increase the reduced rights quota to 2, 550, 000 tonnes, plus a few, and within that quota to change the share-out between the Community ACP producers on the one hand and the third countries on the other."
"Applying such proposals - since, as Mr Aldo most relevantly said recently, the Community's requirements can be assessed at about 4, 000, 000 tonnes - would result in a sharp and lasting decline in prices, to the detriment of producers in the Union and their ACP partners."
"I think we must reject these proposals categorically, bearing in mind that the debate relates to two conceptions of our European Union."
"For our part, we give preference to the farmers defending our territory against the importers operating on the financial flows; we give preference to the producers who create jobs rather than the dealers who make a living out of exploiting the unacceptable social conditions prevailing in third countries."
"Over and above the market itself, the issue in this debate is, therefore, the ideology of free trade against a pattern of events which has a human scale and a human purpose."
"That is why we will unconditionally support the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, whenever Community institutions discuss issues of development cooperation, there appears to be a unanimous wish to aid and promote the development of less advanced countries."
"When it comes to discussing practical commercial issues, on the other hand, one gets the clear impression that it is other interests that prevail, in open contradiction of the need for development cooperation."
"The case of the common organization of the market in bananas is perhaps the most typical example."
"The European Commission's proposals are very negative and threaten, once again, to favour only the interests of the major multinationals that control the European market for 'dollar-zone' bananas and often practise 'dumping' policies."
"The attempt to increase out of all proportion the import quotas for third-country bananas, thus depressing the market and making production in the Community and ACP States definitively uneconomic, is unacceptable."
"But we need to remember that the Commission has often shown itself to be discriminatory in its treatment of poorer countries and ACP States as well."
"The Commission has never been prepared to recognize any 'force majeure' concerning the crisis in banana production in Somalia, caused by the country's well-known troubles, and yet it has reserved more favourable treatment for other traditional producers in the ACP States."
"We, therefore, totally support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, which make provision for fairer organization of the Community market and raising the value of production in the ACP countries."
"We need, therefore, to provide producers and operators trading in ACP bananas with security, by fully consolidating their quotas and allowing supplies to be brought in from other countries until such time as normal production conditions are fully restored - as in the case of Somalia."
"Finally, it is important to allow and encourage importation into the Union of a quota of bananas produced and sold within the framework of fair trade, and we therefore support the two amendments tabled on this issue."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to point out the absence of Mr Mendon√ßa, from Madeira, who should be speaking here today and not myself if it were not for an illness that has kept him away."
"I wish him a speedy recovery."
"The current banana COM was the fruit of one of the toughest rounds of negotiations in the Union's history."
"One country even went before the Court of Justice and its case was rejected."
"The COM was intended to strike a balance on three levels:"
"guaranteeing access, at reasonable prices, to the Union market, for traditional suppliers, without jeopardising the reserve fro up and coming producers; -guaranteeing priority access to ACP producers in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Lom√© Conventions; -guaranteeing Union producers income support to offset their higher production costs and guarantee them arrangements to make them more competitive.After so many disputes and difficulties, with so many political compromises, the Commission has now come along and for some unknown reason decided to destroy that balance, by increasing the banana/dollar quota by 4 % and reducing the ACP quota by the same amount."
"The enlargement of the European Union by three new states does not justify, in any way, a 16 % increase in the quota nor should it shift the way in which the quota is shared out."
"The amendments approved in the Committee on Agriculture sought to reestablish that very balance."
"Therefore I call on my colleagues to support the excellent Santini report and the amendments by the Committee on Agriculture."
"Mr President, as someone from a Community region where bananas are grown, namely Madeira, I cannot but disagree with the Commission's proposal aimed at changing Regulation (EEC) 404/93, establishing a banana COM, since it fails to take account of the interests of Community banana producers or those of ACP countries which have had persistent surpluses recently, given the high level of the annual quota."
"The Commission's latest proposal is mainly aimed at increasing that quota and sharing it among three types of operator, upsetting the current balance and will contribute to the loss of more jobs, generating social and political unrest, with especially negative effects on the ACP countries."
"We would agree if the Commission had take account of the principle of Community preference and complied with its commitments to ACP countries as part of the Fourth Lom√© Convention."
"We would agree if it put more emphasis on environmental and ecological aspects, linked to local production, especially those which respect the landscape and environment, since both factors are vital for tourism, a very important industry in Madeira."
"We would agree if the Commission had wanted to change the production support system, to make the compensatory amounts more flexible, based on a specific calculation that reflected each region's production."
"But since that is not the case, we are opposed to the Commission proposals; we think they are premature and we have not even had the findings of the banana round-table which might make a good contribution to the future of the banana COM."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing grateful thanks on behalf of the Commission to Mr Santini, although he is not present today, and to the committees which have again looked into the common organization of the market in bananas."
"This is in fact the third time in 18 months that Parliament has been asked to deliver its opinion on an amendment to the common organization of the market in bananas."
"The proposal which is before you today should be seen as an amendment to the 1995 proposal for a regulation."
"At that time Parliament expressed its overall approval of the amendments put forward, together with a number of comments and requests for further amendments."
"For technical reasons, the draft regulation contains several points which had already been proposed in 1995."
"One of these is the increase in the tariff quota to take account of the accession of the new Member States, which was accepted by Parliament in June 1995."
"The quota for the Community of the twelve was previously set at 2.2 million tonnes."
"An increase restricted to 100 000 tonnes would clearly be inadequate to meet the additional requirement generated by the accession of the three new Member States, nor would it cover the traditional trade flows, estimated at 353 000 tonnes."
"A quota amounting to 2.3 million tonnes is, therefore, both inadequate and unjustified, since it does not accord with the traditional trade flow. This means that Amendment No 6 is not acceptable to the Commission."
"Conversely, a tariff quota amounting to 3 million tonnes, as demanded in Amendments Nos 10 and 11, would immediately result in a sharp and general drop in prices."
"This would affect bananas from all countries of origin and would thus hit weaker producers particularly hard."
"Amendments Nos 10 and 11 are therefore just as unacceptable as Amendment No 6."
"In addition to an increase in the tariff quota, the Commission proposes changing the way it is shared among the groups involved in the market."
"This adjustment takes account of the supply structure of the three new Member States, which had previously imported neither Community bananas nor ACP bananas."
"Thus it would be illogical to increase the allocation of import licences to Category B operators with the tariff quota."
"The reduction in the tariff quota share for market participants who import Community and ACP bananas from 30 % to 26 % is simply an arithmetical operation and means that the absolute number of licences for Category B operators will not be reduced."
"I can see no grounds, therefore, for Amendment No 7, and I am also unable to accept Amendment No 1, which is linked to Amendment No 7."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8 and 9 envisage special provisions for cases in which importers suffer losses owing to crisis situations in exporting ACP States."
"These amendments are problematic for various reasons."
"Firstly, it is not easy to delimit crisis situations precisely."
"In such cases it is better to fall back on the concept of force majeure, for which there are legal precedents."
"Secondly, the Commission has proposed measures for cases in which the import of ACP bananas is disrupted for reasons of force majeure, to ensure both that the market continues to be supplied adequately and that market participants affected are compensated."
"Thirdly, in the event of disruption for reasons other than force majeure - if, for example, an ACP State is not in a position to export the full amount allocated to it for the year - a temporary reassignment is possible."
"With regard to the particular situation in Somalia, let us not forget that it would be possible to consider temporarily reassigning the traditional quantities not imported."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8 and 9 overlap with existing proposals."
"I feel obliged to reject them for the reasons cited above."
"Now I come to Amendments Nos 3 and 12, which relate to production under environmentally and socially responsible conditions."
"The consideration cited in Amendment No 3 is out of place in this draft regulation for formal reasons."
"It would not be appropriate to carry it."
"However, in terms of its content, the Commission acknowledges that this type of production deserves support."
"At the same time, it is not possible to establish a special quota for so-called fair trade bananas, since this would contravene WTO regulations."
"For this reason Amendments Nos 12 and 13 cannot be taken into consideration."
"A more appropriate way to support fair trade bananas would be to encourage advertising campaigns on their behalf, aimed at European consumers."
"The various options in this field have been thoroughly examined, and I hope they will soon lead to the introduction of concrete measures."
"I know that Parliament sees this as an important issue, and I shall keep it informed of future developments."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Before we move to the vote, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf wishes to make a statement."
"Mr President, I wish to announce that before the final vote on the legislative resolution I shall ask for the report to be referred back to committee, since I assume that Amendment No 7 will be carried and the Commission has declared that it will not accept Amendment No 7, unless it declares after the vote, when the amendment has been carried, that it will accept it after all."
"Then we shall be facing a different situation, but I did not want matters to move so fast that I was unable to intervene."
"This is why I am making the announcement now."
"Mr President, in view of the Commissioner's refusal to accept the amendments, I wish to support the motion for referral back to committee."
"Thank you, Mr Medina and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for telling me in advance what you are going to do, but you will have to do it at the appropriate time."
"We will now move to the vote on the amendments."
"After approval of the Commission proposal:"
"Mr President, under Rule 129 of our Rules of Procedure and on behalf of my Group I request that the report be referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Mr President, I want to confirm what I said earlier and support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's proposal."
"Mr Fern√°ndez Mart√≠n has the floor now to speak in favour of the request for referral back to committee."
"Mr President, this is the same situation as we had in October 1995, when Parliament voted the way that it has and the Commissioner rejected the amendments Parliament had voted for by a majority."
"So to be consistent with that position, we are going to support referral back to committee."
"Mr Liese has the floor to speak against the request for referral back to committee."
"Mr President, I regret that I must contradict Fern√°ndez Mart√≠n, a fellow member of the PPE Group, but the position with regard to our Group's decision was that we wished to reject the difficult Amendment No 6."
"Obviously, therefore, we cannot now support the referral because this amendment will not be accepted by the Commission."
"It is sensible for Mr Fischler not to accept the amendment."
"Therefore we are voting against the referral."
"(Parliament decided to refer the report back to the committee responsible)"
"The Community Regulation instituting the COM in bananas takes account of the commitments entered into previously by the European Union (Community preference, preferential access for ACP bananas, GATT rules applicable to third countries)."
"There are thus two parts to the COM:"
"an internal part which provides, for Community producers, a compensatory aid system intended to offset the net losses resulting from the departitioning of the market."
"This aid is intended to limit to 854, 000 tonnes the quantities that can be marketed for the Community producers, who include, among others, those in the French overseas departments; -and an external part, which provides for a volume of 857, 700 tonnes at zero duty for the traditional ACP States and a tariff quota of 2.2 million tonnes at reduced duty (dollar zone bananas, in essence).Consequently, I voted in favour of Amendments Nos 3 and 7."
"I naturally voted against Amendments Nos 10, 11, 12 and 13, whose only purpose is to encourage imports of dollar zone bananas to the detriment of European and ACP producers, to whom, may I remind you, we have commitments associated with our history and with our traditional and preferential trading relationships."
"Is the principle of the 'acquis communautaire' already a multispeed one, and is it not worth more in connection with our contractual commitments to our partners under the Lom√© Convention?"
"An increase in the custom's quota is very much in the interests of the Swedish consumer."
"We wish to see more free trade in bananas on the world market."
"My aim is to ensure that the Swedish consumer be given a choice when they buy bananas."
"They should be offered best quality bananas at the lowest possible prices."
"Naturally, I also hope that consumers if they so wish, should be able to chose bananas which have been produced under the best possible ecological and social conditions."
"There is every reason to complain about the EU's current joint organisation for the banana market."
"It is preposterous that the price of bananas has increased by 20 % in Sweden since we joined the EU."
"The banana COM for which there is a proposal for changes to certain aspects of the regulation, has offered Community producers a precious and fair assistance keeping hopes alive of maintaining and improving this crop, bringing it up to acceptable yield levels."
"A case of solidarity and economic and social cohesion well expressed through the principle of Community preference, a principle we would like to see extended, especially in relation to high quality crops, farming crops or not, in the ultra-peripheral regions of the European Union."
"In my small island region, with a sub-tropical climate in part of its growing area, banana farming is of particular importance, not only because it involves over 8000 producers and an annual crop running into tens of thousands of tonnes, 20 % of the farming GDP, but also because the attractive plantations enhance the landscape, which attracts tourists to Madeira."
"Madeiran producers, since Portugal joined the Union, applauded the COM but are now concerned that important into the Community might be increased, which would obviously overload the market with negative effects on their interests. They have asked for compensatory amounts to be increased and to be complemented so as to improve their meagre incomes."
"We want to defend them and will fight for their rights."
"By lending support to the Santini report which goes against Community banana growers and ACP producers, we hope that the Commission does not increase imports from third countries over and above 2.3 million tonnes - not justified at all by the entry of three new Member States."
"We think that it is fair not to go along with the Commission proposal and to share out the import quota granted to third countries in accordance with Regulation (EEC 404/93, with a 30 % share for operators marketing Community bananas and/or importing additional ACP bananas (category B operators) since there is no justification in reducing their share of the market."
"Community structural assistance for Ireland"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0284/96) by Mr G. Collins, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission decision on the establishment of the Community support framework for Community structural assistance for the Irish regions concerned by Objective 1, which is the whole country (C40037/96)."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to express my gratitude to the members of the Committee on Regional Policy for their cooperation in producing this report."
"I would like to thank all those who participated in the excellent hearing we had on this subject on 7 May."
"In particular, I thank the Irish Minister for Finance for his contribution."
"I was particularly pleased to note that, speaking at a recent European seminar in Ireland, the Minister shared all the essential conclusions of my report."
"Both the first and second Community support frameworks confirm the policies of successive Irish governments."
"Both CSFs confirm the efforts that have been made to pursuing economic and social development in order to attain the Community average and to meet the conditions for participating in EMU."
"I fully approve the four priorities established by the second Community support framework for the period 1994-1999."
"It has to be said that both the first and the present CSF have been success stories for Ireland."
"Over the period most, if not all, of the economic indicators have shown particular improvements."
"Ireland's economic growth increased on average to 5 % of GNP, the best performance of any Member State of the EU."
"Employment rose by almost 2 % per annum and the balance of payments which was marginally in deficit in 1989, was in surplus by 8 % of GNP in 1995."
"The budget deficit continued to decline to below 2 % in line with public borrowing."
"While it is undeniable that the Irish economy has several key assets such as a young and active population, significant potential for tourism and a steady application of a rigorous and consistent national economic policy, we must not forget that various problems arising notably from the peripheral situation of the island and its low population density, the importance of its agricultural sector, the country's dependence on foreign-owned companies and the weakness of its domestic industry all beset the economic and social development of Ireland."
"I must emphasize that the actual incidence of long-term unemployment is much higher in Ireland than statistics show."
"I cannot stress enough the imperative necessity both at national and Community level to make more effective inroads on unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, during this period."
"The Irish authorities must use the mid-term review to make urgent adjustments."
"They must tackle the problem of unemployment headon."
"The mid-term review must not be another missed opportunity."
"We must strengthen interventions from both the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund."
"We must improve them in a way that enables measures to improve education and qualifications to be more effectively coordinated with job-creating investment."
"I cannot emphasize enough the need to strengthen education and vocational training structures and significantly so, with the purpose of improving the level of qualifications achieved by young people."
"I am only too aware that only the more highly qualified employees can take full advantage of the new job opportunities created through ERDF assistance."
"The high level of school drop-outs and young men and women with no qualifications in Ireland is of particular concern to me."
"I therefore call on the Irish authorities significantly to increase the number of training places for these young people."
"Without well-grounded educational and initial occupational training, the danger of decline into long-term unemployment will increase enormously."
"We cannot and must not let this happen."
"I would like to see much stronger financial support for social infrastructure measures which would open up new education, training and employment opportunities for women, in particular for disadvantaged women."
"In view of the strong presence of foreign interests in Ireland, we must improve the capacity of the domestic market."
"In this context development and competitiveness of the small and medium-sized enterprises is essential."
"My report also underlines the fact that it is crucial for Ireland's economic and social future to develop and diversify its agricultural sector, hence the importance of the LEADER II programme; modernize the fisheries section and aquaculture to restore their opportunities for development; create new opportunities for the development and diversification of a year-round high-quality tourist industry; and apply the principle of long-term environmentally acceptable development."
"I emphasize that it is imperative that since Ireland is an island nation to make continuous progress towards the completion of the necessary road, rail, port and airport infrastructures."
"Without economic and social cohesion we know there is no prospect of a viable EMU."
"At the end of the present CSF in 1999 I have no doubt that there will be many regions in Ireland still needing significant assistance."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Irish authorities to guarantee that any region in the country still needing assistance in the post-1999 period will be fully assured of all the resources required to strengthen their economic and social cohesion."
"For the future we need a new approach to the ERDF eligibility criteria for the Union in its present composition of fifteen Member States."
"This is something that needs urgent examination by all concerned."
"For my part there is no doubt that they must retain unemployment as one of the priority criteria."
"Finally, my report is a new opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the peace programme for Ireland."
"I stress the importance of cross-border cooperation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at both the economic and political level and I have no doubt of your support on this question."
"Mr President, colleagues, I should like to restrict myself to the subject of the use of appropriations from the Social Fund."
"If Social Fund appropriations have ever been used anywhere in a truly meaningful way, it is in Ireland, as this report shows."
"That must again be stressed from the start."
"For example, Ireland has used money from the Social Fund to enable young people in particular to receive a decent education and occupational training."
"In addition, however, it has also opened up opportunities for the unemployed and the socially disadvantaged to access the labour market, by offering them further education and retraining measures with European aid."
"But it is never true to say that there is no further room for improvement."
"15 % unemployment in Ireland probably speaks for itself."
"After all, we all know that a good education and good occupational training represent the best life assurance."
"This is why I consider that the road the Irish government is going down here is the right one, and I should like to encourage the Irish government to continue down this road, particularly given the fact that over 20 % of young people in Ireland drop out of school and are then usually unable to obtain a job or a training place later."
"These school drop-outs later make up the bulk of the long-term unemployed."
"Therefore it is doubly important to do even more."
"Also, as the rapporteur has already said, it is essential for us to do more to improve the opportunities for women."
"Only 32 % of women are in paid employment, which is over 10 % below the EU average."
"As for the percentage of women in initial occupational training, I do not wish to say much about this at all."
"Women account for under 2 % of apprenticeship training places, and in all honesty it is a joke that a mere 0.4 % of Social Fund appropriations are earmarked for special measures to promote equal opportunities for women."
"While the mainstreaming of promotion of equal opportunities for women introduced into the structural funds in 1994 is important, it is not enough in this context."
"Special programmes to promote equal opportunities for women are therefore imperative."
"If you will forgive my saying so, when we are given an opportunity to instigate a preventive labour-market policy, we should take full advantage of it."
"It is precisely the need to adjust workers' qualifications in line with new profiles and manufacturing processes which will prevent us from financing unemployment instead of work again afterwards."
"After all, there is good reason why 20 % of the Social Fund resources available for horizontal use should be allocated to a preventive labour-market policy, and despite everything Ireland is still a long way from putting this into effect."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Collins and Mrs J√∂ns for their excellent work here in relation to the structural funds for Ireland."
"Ireland is a success story, as we know, in this respect, with an economy which is performing well."
"Our GDP per capita has increased from 64 % of the EU average in 1983 to 87 % last year."
"The labour force is growing steadily and unemployment is at last beginning to fall, down from almost 16 % in 1993 to actually just over 11 % this year."
"There is a bit of confusion about the figures in the reports, but the statistics have come from different areas - but 11 % is my understanding now."
"The three factors I would attribute this success to are: firstly, the sound consensual politics pursued by governments over recent year, but particularly since 1993; secondly, the creation of the single market, which Irish exporters and industry have been able to exploit and, thirdly, the operation of the structural funds since the late 1980s."
"This performance gives the lie to the simplistic and essentially anti-European myth that preparing for EMU necessarily entails higher unemployment and drastic cuts in public expenditure."
"Our Irish example shows that this is clearly not the case."
"As Mr Collins indicates, Ireland has made full and proper use of the structural funds, so much so that if the funds were being allocated in 1996 under the present criteria, i.e., GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the EU average, we would not qualify."
"Structural funding in Ireland, however, will not come to a sudden halt at the end of 1999."
"The criteria for the third phase of the funds, including the regional distribution of funding, will not be decided until early 1998."
"But if we look at the explanatory statement there is a little problem there in that Mr Collins seems to be suggesting that Ireland be divided into separate regions after 1999."
"This might involve Dublin being cut off."
"Now there are huge areas of deprivation in Dublin, pockets of deprivation that I have often spoken about here - I think you are all familiar with my worry over Dublin."
"I do not want to see Dublin being sidelined."
"We have to continue to have our substantial development needs looked after post-1999."
"We must strive to ensure that the structural funds continue to play an important part in achieving the economic and social cohesion which the Treaty underlines."
"Our aim in this context must be to maximise Ireland's share of the structural funds."
"Thank you, Mr President, and Happy Christmas!"
"Mr President, I wish to convey to Mr Collins my congratulations on the presentation of an excellent report."
"This report not only highlights the areas where there are major difficulties but also draws attention to the need for necessary changes in the future."
"Even in the present situation, where Ireland is considered as a single region, there are some parts of the country that are far healthier and much more competitive than others."
"I stress and make no apologies for stressing that the counties of Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo and Galway - all of which are in my Euro-constituency - still remain amongst the most handicapped."
"It is therefore vital that Community structural fund aid continues in these regions after 1999, when the present programme ends."
"Post-1999, Objective 1 status should be granted to the constituency of Connacht/Ulster."
"Economic and social cohesion must not remain simple words: they must also become a reality for the west and the north-west of my country."
"In conclusion, if the way to do this would be to divide the country up into subregions, then so be it!"
"The economic survival of many parts of my constituency will depend on such a subdivision."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Collins on an excellent report and review of the progress to date in Ireland under the Community support frameworks."
"I wish to take the opportunity today to impress on the Commissioner - and since the Commission is a college I know that it is entirely appropriate to do so through Commissioner Monti - the very high ratio relative to other states that these funds have represented as an inflow from the Union to the Irish economy."
"As the Commissioner appreciates, as we move towards the achievement of economic and monetary union with medium-term convergence programmes, stability programmes and so on, it is important that the Commission as a college when it deals with the evolution of regional policy and cohesion policy into the future should, at the earliest stage and without waiting for all the details of the financial perspective and the size of the budget into the year 2000 and beyond, at least delineate the general lines of thinking early enough for states like Ireland, with a major net inflow, to incorporate this into their whole convergence process."
"A sharp discontinuity in flow of funds would be a disaster in terms of the smooth evolution of macroeconomic policy in that context."
"It is clear, as other colleagues have remarked, that under the standard rules Ireland would no longer qualify in the next round as one state, one region under Objective 1."
"I should like to say to the Commissioner, as Mr Collins has pointed out, that the structure of the Irish economy has a very high bias towards foreign industry: over half the net industrial output from that sector, only one-fifth of the employment."
"It distorts our GDP/GNP figures dramatically."
"In most EU countries the average gap between GNP and GDP is 1 or 2 %, in Ireland it is 10 or 11 %, because of the transfer pricing and so on of multinationals. Perhaps for Ireland there is a strong rational economic case for looking at GNP rather than GDP as the index of measurement."
"That, in fact, would not get over, in my view, the problem of one state, one region but it would still be a more realistic basis for assessment, and objectively that would hold versus other states."
"Finally, in respect of the mid-term review, there is an extraordinarily high level of long-term unemployment persisting in the Republic of Ireland, along with a high level of social exclusion."
"This needs to get the focus of any slack funding identified in the existing CSF or any new funding at a halfway term."
"In the context of EMU, the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in Ireland, as everywhere, is employmentintensive per unit of output."
"It is vulnerable in Ireland to one major thing: if Ireland joins the EMU and Britain stays out, they are the vulnerable sector because their first trading is culturally, socially and linguistically in the UK-Irish zone."
"They need a special focus, especially through the structural funds, as a key ingredient for the future."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by speaking about Ireland."
"It is correct to say - and I am glad my colleague has mentioned it - that economic and monetary union will be the counterpart to the structural funds, and Ireland is always described to us as the country setting an example in terms of the trend towards EMU."
"But if we look at the other side of the coin, which reveals 20 % unemployment and 30 % youth unemployment, of which 49 % are long-term unemployed, then we have to ask ourselves just what this trend involves."
"On the other hand, however, Ireland also has the courage to expound a national plan for sustainable regional development, which provides an extremely important basis for deploying the structural funds and offers an opportunity to make genuinely effective use of them."
"At the same time, it is right that combating unemployment is the priority here."
"That should also be made clear in the report."
"We know that Ireland has a great deal of experience, indeed that it already has over 15 years' experience of local employment initiatives, and it would be good if further advances could be achieved in this field."
"Despite this, it should be noted that improvements are necessary; for example, there is still a major problem regarding access for women, and as yet not enough attention is given to ethnic minorities."
"Above all, non-governmental organizations should be involved to a far greater extent in the question of monitoring, as set out in the White Paper and the Green Paper on social policy."
"Mr President, the Commission is delighted with the exhaustive report presented by Mr Collins, whom I congratulate wholeheartedly, just as I congratulate Mrs J√∂ns."
"Over the past few years, Ireland has enjoyed a higher rate of economic growth than any other Member State of the European Union, with its per capita GDP rising from 64 % of the Community average in 1983 to 90 % in 1995."
"I agree with the report's conclusions that these very considerable achievements can be put down to three major factors: firstly, the pursuit of highly coherent national policies in the financial and fiscal field; secondly, real social partnership, as has been stressed, in particular, by Mr Malone; and, finally, a substantial contribution to the rate of growth - of about 1 % - by Community funds."
"It is encouraging to note that positive development has also been reflected in significant reductions in Ireland's high unemployment rate."
"The Commission is, therefore, generally speaking, satisfied with the structural-fund appropriations allocated to Ireland, and not only in terms of overall expenditure."
"The Collins report rightly highlights the progress achieved in terms of indicators measuring the impact on the various sectors of the economy, though there may still be some structural problems in certain regions, as Mr Gallagher has pointed out."
"I should like to congratulate the Irish authorities on their cooperation with the Commission to ensure on-going evaluation of how European taxpayers' money is being spent."
"Evaluation is currently at the phase of mid-term review, which is compulsory for structural-fund interventions."
"All operational programmes, including the Community support framework, are being independently assessed by outside experts."
"These assessments will be discussed by the individual monitoring committees, whose members include representatives of the social partners and the various sectors."
"The Commission greatly appreciates this openness and transparency, and is particularly pleased with the notable contribution made by the regional authorities, which will from now on be represented on the committees responsible for monitoring operational programmes."
"The Collins report is timely, having been produced during the mid-term review, and will certainly make a major contribution."
"I do not intend, not least because there is insufficient time, to make detailed comments on all the points raised by the report, which is very exhaustive."
"I should, however, like to mention a few aspects: firstly, the need to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment in Ireland and, as Mrs Schroedter has pointed out, to encourage women's participation in working life."
"The Commission also appreciates recognition of the need to continue to invest in roads, railways, ports and airports in Ireland, and fully supports the commitment expressed in the report as regards implementing the peace programme for Northern Ireland and the border areas of the Republic."
"The Commission takes note of the report's recommendations concerning the forthcoming definition of eligibility criteria for Objective 1 regions, but points out that this issue will not be considered before the end of the current programming period in 1999."
"Finally, and briefly, Mr President, Mrs J√∂ns has mentioned the high levels of school drop-out."
"Working in collaboration with the Irish authorities, the Commission is trying to find ways of increasing the number of training places available for young people with no qualifications."
"The issue was discussed at the last meeting of the monitoring committee for the 'Human Resources' programme in October, and we hope to see progress being made in the near future."
"Lastly, in response to what Mr Cox said, I have taken note of his various comments and, in particular, of the need he emphasized for us to delineate the general lines of thinking early enough to prevent any sharp discontinuities in the flow of funds."
"I can confirm that, in the light of the review of the financial outlook and looking towards enlargement, the Commission has been carefully considering this matter for some time."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Cross-border cooperation EU/CCEE"
"The next item is the report (A4-0359/96) by Mr Schr√∂der, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission report on the implementation of cross-border cooperation between the Community and countries of Central and Eastern Europe in 1994 (COM(95)0662 - C4-0142/96)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the implementation of the programme with which we are concerned here, namely the programme of cross-border cooperation between the Community and countries of Central and Eastern Europe in 1994, has been one of the Commission's successes."
"This programme was given a budget of ECU 150 million, and thanks to cofinancing a total of ECU 350 million was available, all of which was used to good purpose."
"Cofinancing came largely from the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the private sector."
"What were the aims of the programme of cross-border cooperation?"
"On the one hand, to stabilize border regions, to boost economic development in them and to reduce disparities and, on the other - and this aspect is just as important, if not more so - to facilitate the integration process in the Central and Eastern European states; for we must never forget that we need them as much as they need us."
"Turning to the question of whether further improvements need to be made, I would say that there is always room for improvement, and in this particular case a more varied spread of measures is required."
"To date the emphasis has been on supporting the transport infrastructure, the environment and also the energy sector."
"I should like more advantage to be taken of the possibilities in these sectors."
"I should also like to see multiannual programming and increased funding for the ECOS, OUVERTURE and INTERREG II initiatives."
"It is very easy to say that funding must be increased without specifying where such resources are supposed to come from."
"I should therefore like to make two proposals, although I shall only outline them briefly."
"I am certain that next year a report by the Committee on Regional Policy will lead to a deepening of the problem."
"I have already mentioned this in the debate on the Christodoulou report."
"I hope you will allow me to outline these two possibilities of cutting down on funding in the field of structural policy and using the funds saved for cross-border cooperation and, I may say, not only for cross-border cooperation."
"The first point is that in future it will no longer be a question simply of supporting underdeveloped regions as such, but of supporting what are obviously disadvantaged regions."
"This will, in future, need to be specified precisely."
"In this context I should like to cite three aspects: firstly geographical disadvantages - even after enlargement, Madeira or the Greek islands will always be on the margins of Europe -, then climatic factors - northern Finland or northern Sweden will always be cold and will suffer as a result - and lastly historical factors."
"Here I am thinking in particular of the new German L√§nder , for the effects of 40 years of socialism in practice were devastating, and we are now having enormous difficulty in dealing with them."
"This, then, is one possibility, namely to apply the criterion of obviously disadvantaged regions."
"The second point I wish to make is that we should completely abandon the principle of giving everyone a slice of the cake and instead use financial resources in a targeted way, in other words inject financial aid where it is specifically needed."
"In my view, we cannot continue to support whole states or regions indiscriminately, but should direct support to specifically targeted areas, right down to parts of cities - I believe we should plan as accurately as that - so that funding will be available for cross-border cooperation between the European Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and, I repeat, not simply for cross-border cooperation."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Commission again for its good work and to tell the Commissioner that we await with great interest the Commission's corresponding report for 1995."
"Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations on the 1994 programme of cross-border cooperation we are dealing with, highlights the fact that this cooperation has proved to be an especially useful instrument in terms of the pre-accession strategy for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"In fact, cross-border cooperation between these countries and those of the European Union has made contact between the border regions possible at the political level and thus increased the degree of trust and good neighbourliness between them. At the same time it is allowing stable habits of cooperation to develop, familiarizing the CCEEs with the Union's management methods and, above all, encouraging in the associate countries the sense of belonging to a common area, hence accelerating the process of adaptation prior to accession."
"So the programme has clearly had positive results overall."
"That is precisely why the Committee on External Economic Relations believes the budget should be increased for the measures to promote cooperation, both cross-border and inter-regional, particularly between regions of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and regions of the European Union."
"For the sake of greater effectiveness in the future, we should also consider making the programmes multi-annual and intensifying the measures to promote cooperation in training, especially business training, and the transfer of technology and marketing skills to small and medium-sized firms, given that they represent an irreplaceable factor in the economic development of these countries."
"In addition, the Committee on External Economic Relations believes it is fundamentally important to establish operational mechanisms to coordinate the various European Union programmes and the PHARE programme if we are to optimize the return on Union resources and thus increase the effectiveness and incidence of the measures funded by them."
"That is an aim the Committee on External Economic Relations fully supports."
"Thank you very much, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen."
"I can assure you that Mrs Ferrer could not have improved much on your excellent Spanish."
"But do not take that as excessive flattery, because Mrs Ferrer and I usually speak Catalan and our Spanish is not all that perfect."
"Anyway, many thanks."
"Madam President, may I thank Mr Schr√∂der for this report, which provides a good basis for a general debate on interregional and particularly cross-border cooperation."
"Cross-border cooperation has been a very successful element in the Union's activities, but it could certainly be developed to render it even more effective, for example with a view to forthcoming enlargement."
"I wish to stress that cross-border cooperation can also be combined with interregional cooperation."
"In my opinion it affords many opportunities for the EU countries and future Member States, their regional authorities and regional NGOs to develop practical cooperation between the regions, as well as administration and democratic structures."
"In this way close practical cooperation can be established."
"In order for cooperation at borders and cross-border cooperation to achieve really impressive results, it should be possible to monitor the effectiveness of the existing programmes more effectively than at present."
"The problem is how to find the right means."
"On the one hand, additional supervision rules are needed, while on the other, the subsidiarity principle must be respected."
"In my opinion, more measurable results should also be attained in the EU's programme cooperation with third countries."
"The Commission and those responsible for the implementation of programmes should reach agreement on priorities, objectives and ways of evaluating them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by congratulating my colleague and friend, Mr Schr√∂der, not only on his excellent report on the implementation of the programmes on cooperation between the European Union and the CCEEs, but also on his constant concern about the problems arising from the enlargement of the Union to include Central and Eastern Europe, and especially for his broad understanding of the repercussions that the enlargement is having on the less developed regions of the Union, as his report demonstrates."
"This Parliament is highly sensitive to the issue, which is at the very centre of the Union's priorities."
"That is demonstrated, to mention a few examples not included in Mr Schr√∂der's considerations, by some of the statements of the Europa 2000 Plus report on the organization of the territory of Europe - for which I myself was the rapporteur - and by Mr Speciale's report in connection with the debate on the financial framework for Community initiative programmes over the next few years."
"The request to continue the INTERREG programme through a new INTERREG III responds to a need within the CCEE's current pre-accession strategy of cross-border cooperation."
"The excellent results of the PHARE programmes and INTERREG II, as set out by Mr Schr√∂der in his report, are a stimulus to greater effort in this direction."
"Naturally an increase in expenditure, with new funds and programmes to finance the enlargement, must not endanger the stability pact necessary to guarantee the success of economic and monetary union."
"An effort of imagination and solidarity is needed to make both things possible."
"Deepening and widening the Union are not and should not be mutually exclusive objectives - but no-one is saying the challenge is easy."
"Mr President, we have had a rather chaotic and busy time of it, but we have this week discussed a few matters of historically important strategy which on the eve of the IGC are concerned with enlargement, notably the Christodoulou and Rehder reports, and this report by Mr Schr√∂der is a very practical expos√© of what the Union will be doing in future with Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is a good thing to reduce the economic and social conflicts in the border regions."
"It prevents depopulation, but it also promotes regional stability."
"As we know, the need for money to achieve this is so great that the funds given on a once-only basis have already been fully used up."
"That is reassuring and encouraging."
"So what do we now need to do in future?"
"Prevent any overlapping, diversify our measures more, and thus look at more than just infrastructure and environment, and above all guaranteeing cohesiveness."
"I look to the Commission to continue doing what it has done in the past, namely reporting to us and informing us of how additional funds, more financial resources can be found."
"That is important."
"Cross-border cooperation gives the citizen faith in Europe."
"We need that in the Union and outside the Union too, because what is ultimately at stake here is stability in Europe."
"Mr President, first I would like to turn to Mr Schr√∂der, whom I know to be a very agreeable representative for his country in this Parliament, and thank him for his short and concrete report."
"Eleven Eastern and Central European countries have applied for membership of the EU."
"Regardless of how long it takes for them to be members and regardless of whether they become full members or if some other form of association is chosen, it is very important that we strengthen our cross border cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The measures established in 1994 in the fields of energy, the infrastructure and the environment must continue and they ought to be extended to include other areas such as the economy, education, exchange of technology and a vastly extended social and political cooperation, with a broadening of the PHARE and other programmes."
"The liberal group supports the programme and wants to see it implemented and strengthened along with an expanded internal cooperation between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and between these countries and Russia and other OECD countries."
"Mr President, better cooperation between the EU and Eastern and Central Europe is, long-term, one of the most important actions to promote peace and security in our part of the world."
"Mr President, in contrast to cross-border cooperation within the EU, it is still not possible to support joint projects on the borders with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"In the course of my visits to Euro-regions I have established that, while the programmes are certainly welcomed, when it comes to concrete implementation it is enormously problematic to support joint projects."
"I should like to quote two examples: a ferry crossing is to be established on the Oder; one border station is built and then the other border station is built - one is eligible for support from INTERREG and the other for support from PHARE - but the ferry which is to cross the river between the two is not eligible for funding, and so the project comes to nothing."
"To give another example: a sewage treatment plant is to be built in a valley, and for geographical reasons this can only be done on the Czech side."
"Everything is in place but one thing is missing: the pipe from the German to the Czech side."
"Because it runs on the border, it is not eligible for funding, and this may mean that the project comes to nothing."
"We need to resolve problems of this kind as a matter of urgency."
"We cannot allow cross-border cooperation to revert to the conditions of the old interzone border."
"I have, therefore, tabled an amendment which proposes that we should at least try to link the ERDF 10 Regulation with PHARE's micro-programme in model projects, and this needs a very rapid decision."
"I am pleased that there are signs that the rapporteur believes this amendment should be carried. I consider that in any case this improves the quality of the report."
"It is also important that the second amendment should be carried, since the Euro-regions occupy a key position in the question of enlargement."
"After all, we are in favour of rapid enlargement, are we not?"
"Mr President, our group unanimously supports all the conclusions of Mr Schr√∂der's report on cross-border and regional cooperation with the CCEEs."
"By this means we are easing their integration, cementing relations and mutual understanding, and making a significant contribution to the economic development of their regions."
"But in view of the report and the committee's conclusions, we clearly need to increase the funding for the measures of inter-regional cooperation between CCEE and EU regions."
"Logically, we should also improve the implementation process to make the development plans for the European regions more effective in areas as vital as transport infrastructure, environmental protection, and the use and distribution of energy, and we should also making a special effort to boost cooperation in training and business development for what we regard as the basic sector in the future economy of the integration, the small and medium-sized firms."
"All this would mean we were designing a genuine and effective strategy for the future accession of these countries to the European Community project. This would make the process less traumatic and more natural for them, and the Member States would see a reduction in the wide political, economic and social differences that exist in some specific cases."
"Mr President, we must strengthen and boost programmes along these lines, like INTERREG, PHARE and especially ECOS/OUVERTURE."
"This will strengthen cross-border relations between the regions of the European Union and the CCEE regions."
"However, we must be demanding with ourselves and strictly control the results of these measures so as to avoid the serious mistakes which have been made in some cases, and, of course, attempts to defraud."
"I am winding up, Mr President."
"We can evaluate the outturn for the year 1994 as good overall, but we now look forward to the results for 1995 to confirm favourable development of the application and development of these cross-border and inter-regional programmes for cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Schr√∂der on his excellent report, since he attaches particular importance to the Euro-regions."
"In my view their role is becoming increasingly important given the fact that the debate on enlargement is now, as it were, shifting from declarations of intent and fine words to actual 'homework' ."
"We need this cooperation not only to boost economic development and make traffic possible again on both sides of the borders, for both sides have been disadvantaged for very many years, but we need to use it also to heal historical wounds."
"There can scarcely be a better way of healing these than by cooperation in the Euro-regions."
"Mr Pirker knows about cooperation between the Carinthians and the Slovenes, the Styrians and the Slovenes, where there is the problem of the divided Radkersburg."
"In the debate on Slovenia we discussed G√∂rz, which is divided between Italy and Slovenia, we have cooperation on the borders between Bavaria and Bohemia and Saxony and Bohemia - I myself was one of the cofounders of the Euro-region of Neisse between Poland, Bohemia and Saxony - and in all these regions we need to promote cultural cooperation."
"Perhaps we should do more in future in the way of cross-border support for the media."
"In northern Bohemia, Mr P√¨aoda, who is a journalist, is producing a CzechGerman-Polish newspaper; we should support minority languages on both sides of the borders, the German minority in the Czech Republic, the Sorbian minority in Saxony."
"There is a wide arena for cooperation, for example in environmental protection too, in other words we are witnessing not the end of a trend, but the beginning."
"Those who believe, and are always making their views known, that basically we could do without it, since the first rank of candidates for accession to the Community are already so far developed that they no longer need it, are deceiving themselves, for they are the very ones who have a long way to go to catch up, as an extremely poor region has bordered on a relatively rich one for a very long time."
"Mr President, I venture to describe Mr Schr√∂der's report as excellent."
"And were it not for his obsession with austerity and his insistence that the enlargement does not have to mean an increase in costs for the European Union, I would venture to call it magnificent."
"But that small difference remains and I hope that in the coming dialogue we can convince Mr Schr√∂der that there is a need for additional funds if we want to be realistic about the enlargement."
"Obviously, Mr Schr√∂der's report resonates beyond its immediate objective, which is to analyze the position for the year 1994, and that is another merit of the report."
"Enlargement is already the issue here."
"We are clearly talking about a pre-accession situation."
"INTERREG is still small, all the existing projects are still small, and we need to be speaking positively and inclusively about those countries which expect so much of the European Union and whose rapid accession we definitely support."
"We must take Mr Schr√∂der's report as a starting point for talking about the future in greater depth, and unless we want to linger in Utopia, as the previous speaker said, that depth should lead to a clear proposal from Parliament to create a financial instrument for the pre-accession countries, a specific instrument which incorporates PHARE, INTERREG, and other programmes."
"We must think about the global cooperation needed by the countries that are now on the point of joining and those we hope to welcome soon."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti, and your Spanish is really good too."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Schr√∂der on his report."
"I have been a very strong supporter of cross-border cooperation because of the need to develop those run-down areas which, by virtue of previous hostilities, have always had very little economic activity, and because cross-border cooperation gives a very practical example of the importance of peoples working together."
"The more examples we have, the easier it is to ensure a long-term peaceful solution to border problems."
"I have several points to make."
"Firstly, I welcome paragraph 6 and Mr Monti's remarks that we should move away from hard infrastructure towards soft infrastructure."
"That is the next stage and we ought to be encouraging it."
"I support the rapporteur's other observations about multiannual programmes and the need for greater coordination."
"We are still concerned about insufficient coordination in this particular area."
"One final point, not mentioned in the report I have to say, is that some of the countries involved are countries where the financial systems are not as strong as they should be - I will say no more."
"We must ensure that these funds are not subject in any way to fraud as this will undermine the legitimacy of what the European Union is trying to achieve."
"Support system for producers of certain arable crops"
"The next item is the report (A4-0378/96) by Mr Hallam, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops (COM(96)0175 - C4-0389/96-96/0167(CNS))."
"Mr President, set-aside is a very unpopular regime."
"It is unpopular with farmers and the public, but it has been very successful in reducing surplus production, and so some form of set-aside will be with us for many years."
"This proposal aims to make the situation more flexible."
"It helps producers who have suffered climatic disasters by granting total or partial exemptions in the year in question and in the base area in question."
"It enables Member States, which opt to treat the whole of their territory as a single base area, to subdivide and then concentrate the overshoot provisions on particular regions and a particular sub-base area."
"It is a proposal which will enable our Member States to be much more flexible in their application of the set-aside rules."
"I wish to refer to the two amendments submitted today."
"The one by Mr des Places was rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It would make things much more complicated and so I would urge the House to reject that particular amendment again."
"I am concerned about Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez's amendment, which tries to extend the special provisions put into this report to help the Spanish farmers for a second year."
"I am sorry that this was not debated at the Agriculture Committee but my understanding is that this would mean a doubling of the expenditure that has already been incurred in that particular area."
"So, reluctantly - because I do not like turning down amendments - I have to ask you to reject that particular amendment."
"As you know, it is Christmas and we are coming to the end of the year."
"For me, this year did not start on 1 January: for me this year really started on 20 March - the Commissioner laughs at that point because I think his year started on 20 March as well."
"On Christmas Day I will be eating an organically-reared turkey, grown and matured in my own constituency - in fact the turkey in question is about to meet his maker this afternoon."
"But the day after Christmas Day - Boxing Day, as we call it in Britain - I do not know what it is called elsewhere in the European Union - we shall sit round our family table and we will eat a nice piece of British beef."
"I look forward to the export ban being lifted at some point during next year and I hope that next year, next Boxing Day, you, the citizens of the European Union, will be able to join me in eating a good piece of British roast beef."
"I thank the Commissioner for all his work during the year in helping us overcome this crisis and let us hope that for our agricultural industry better times are ahead."
"Thank you very much, Mr Hallam, and we hope you enjoy all the excellent meals coming your way."
"Mr President, the structural imbalances detected in the systems for basic areas and regionalization plans for the various Member States led the November 1995 Agriculture Council to adopt an agreement by which the Commission was charged with drawing up and presenting, in January 1996, a proposal amending Council Regulation 1765/92, in order to make the sanctions system more flexible."
"First it was established that the Commission could grant total or partial exemption from penalties if basic areas were exceeded when exceptional weather conditions reduced crop yields significantly."
"Secondly, the national and regional basic areas would be defined in each Member State to allow the penalties to be applied more fairly, restricting them to the regions responsible for the situation."
"For bureaucratic reasons, there has been delay in implementing this regulation and the Spanish members of the Group of the European People's Party have therefore tabled an amendment to ensure that its provisions are implemented in the 1996-1997 financial year."
"The Group of the European People's Party does not support Amendments Nos 2 and 4 because we think the Commission's text has greater technical rigour."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Hallam on his report."
"Together with my colleagues Mr Jacob and Mr des Places, I tabled a number of amendments, one of which seems to me very important - Amendment No 4."
"The objectives of this amendment are simple."
"First, it introduces greater flexibility into the principle of compulsory set-aside."
"Everyone must know that there is nothing mathematical about farming."
"Farmers are exposed to constraints which they can do very little to overcome, constraints imposed by the climate, the topography and the size and agricultural quality of their land."
"It is important, therefore, to be able to make internal transfers within regional or national arrangements."
"This amendment is also intended to establish a degree of equity between those Member States which opted for national rather than regional references."
"It should be recalled that equity is the fundamental principle of any economic organization."
"Finally, I must make it clear that this amendment has no impact on the European Union budget."
"So no budgetary argument can be advanced against it."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I hope that Amendment No 4 will be adopted by this House, in the interests of European agricultural policy but, most of all, in the interests of the farmers themselves."
"Mr President, our Group agrees with the Hallam report and I believe those measures should be adopted on behalf of the Spanish producers afflicted by drought, and that this general principle that Member States should be exempt from financial sanctions in the event of overshoots, when they are due to exceptional climatic conditions, is correct."
"I have a question for Commissioner Fischler, relating to another category of producers affected by exceptional climatic conditions, by natural disasters in September - I refer to cotton producers in Greece."
"Does Mr Fischler know that for 15 days economic life in Greece has been paralysed, is he aware that the road network has been blocked all over Greece, and does he understand that the nucleus of those mobilizations are the producers in certain parts of Karditsa and Trikala, where a major disaster destroyed up to 80 % or 90 % of their cotton crop?"
"At the same time, however, they are required to pay the co-responsibility tax, with the result that they have reached desperation."
"You all know that if you turn on Euronews, the first thing reported every day now is the drama that is afflicting Greece with the desperation and harsh mobilization of the farmers, led by the cotton producers of Karditsa and Trikala whose crops were largely destroyed."
"Here, in the Regulation, I see the following principle very rightly stated: Member States shall be exempt from financial sanctions in the event of overshoots, if the latter result from exceptional climatic conditions."
"For cereals and other arable crops we have the set-aside system, while for cotton we have the co-responsibility tax system."
"I want to ask Mr Fischler, and I expect an answer, which I believe is also awaited by all the farmers, while I believe in parallel that Mr Fischler's position could play some part in determining the outcome of developments in Greece, where we expect much from the Commission and in particular from Mr Fischler in person:"
"first, has any application been made by the Greek government to assist precisely this category of producers, who are the nucleus of the mobilization, and-secondly, regardless of whether or not an application has been submitted, how does Mr Fischler view the possibility of some intervention by the Commission of the European Union, to address the issue of the areas that have reached desperation?"
"Does he accept the general principle - which of course means after it has been examined by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and I am aware of the difficulties - that special measures can be adopted on sanctions when there have been exceptional climatic conditions, and that the said principle could also apply for Greek cotton in the specific areas affected?"
"Mr President, I in turn should like to stress the value of Amendment No 4, which we tabled together with Mr Martens, Mr Jacob and Mr des Places."
"In the Member States which have national base areas, the Commission proposal fails to solve any problems."
"It is appropriate not to discriminate between the Member States and to allow offsetting between base areas, whether they be regional or whether they be national."
"The issue is as much to benefit from any overshoots as to arrive at an extraordinary set-aside rate specific to each farm."
"The danger is that the overshooting of several national base areas will result in the existence of several extraordinary set-aside rates on a single farm: one rate for irrigated maize, one rate for dry maize, one rate for the other dry cereals, one rate for the other irrigated cereals."
"To solve these problems, we propose that the 'volume' overshoot should be assessed by weighting the surface areas by the yield of the base areas."
"I should recall that our amendment has no financial impact on the European Union's budget, in so far as the intention is to avoid offsetting a hectare of a high-yield base area against a hectare of a low-yield base area."
"In conclusion, this amendment enables discrimination between Member States to be avoided, discrimination between those which have opted for regional base areas and those which have opted for national base areas."
"This amendment also represents simplification, since it will enable many producers to have only one extraordinary set-aside rate per farm."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Hallam for his report on the Commission's proposal."
"The proposal which is before you was drafted by the Commission in response to a request by the Council."
"The content does not exceed the terms of our brief, since otherwise the principles of the 1992 reform would be weakened, particularly in respect of implementing controls on production."
"The suppression of extraordinary set-aside would mean giving up a specific instrument for controlling production and might mean a future increase in the rate of compulsory set-aside throughout the Union."
"This contradicts the aim given expression in the proposal before you, namely to increase the sense of responsibility of producers."
"Such an amendment might also be seen by our WTO partners as an opportunity for attacking the Union's handling of the blue box."
"Nor is the suppression of extraordinary set-aside desirable, particularly since, under the regulations currently in force, it is possible to suspend its application if this appears necessary on the basis of an analysis of the market situation."
"Such was the case, for example, in the current year."
"The second amendment tabled in the report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development aims to apply the additional area of 150 000 hectares granted on a temporary basis to the new L√§nder of the Federal Republic of Germany, which faced restructuring problems, to the whole of the Federal Republic."
"The Commission does not consider this to be justified and is of the opinion that an unjustified precedent would be set by introducing such a change in Germany."
"I am unable to accept Amendment No 3 because it does not appear to me to be a suitable way of resolving the Spanish problem."
"What you are really trying to achieve with this amendment is to make it possible to overshoot base areas with irrigated crops."
"In this case the compensation exceeds the share of the budget allocated to Spain, resulting in a reduction in the compensation payments for all Spanish producers in the 1997 harvest."
"With regard to Amendment No 4, I can only emphasize that this would favour intensive crops such as maize and irrigated crops and, instead of keeping production under control, this would cause it to increase."
"In addition, the proposed system would lead to further complications in a regime which is already very complex."
"This opinion is after all shared by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which also rejected this amendment."
"Mr Alavanos, as regards what you said about cotton, I should like to draw to your attention the fact that cotton production and cultivation do not come under the heading of arable areas and arable crops; it is a special crop and cannot, therefore, be dealt with in this context."
"In answer to your question as to whether the Greek government has made a proposal, I am assuming that the Greek representative will speak on this matter on Monday, at the Council of Ministers of Agriculture."
"I would not wish to end without also expressing my thanks to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for rejecting some proposed amendments which would only have complicated this already very complex regulation still further."
"Mr President, I know that, and I did not ask the Commissioner whether cotton is included among arable crops."
"It is not included, and it cannot be dealt with under this Regulation."
"My question, to which I would like an answer from the Commissioner, is whether, consistent with the rationale of relaxing sanctions somewhat in the event of exceptional climatic conditions, the Commission could discuss the possibility of some measures for cotton, outside this Regulation, for areas that have been afflicted and that form the nucleus of the mobilizations and drama taking place in Greece today."
"Mr President, I am sorry that we are not going to accept our report in toto ."
"I would, however, ask the House to back fully the submission by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and support Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"I would express to the Commission our hope that it will take our views on board even at this late stage."
"Mr President, Mr Alavanos, I can only add to the explanation I have already given by saying again that I am sure that if the Greek government has particular wishes, it will make them known to the Commission."
"Naturally we shall then submit their proposal to appropriate and careful examination."
"Without having a proposal, however, I cannot promise in advance a decision on a proposal which does not exist."
"Thank you, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Community aid schemes (' integrated system' )"
"The next item is the report (A4-0286/96) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 establishing an integrated administrative and control system for certain Community aid schemes (' integrated system' ) (COM(96)0174 - C4-0313/96-96/0122(CNS))."
"Mr President, thank you for your concern. I am sincerely grateful."
"Today we complete the parliamentary procedure on a report which has had a very bumpy ride."
"To begin with, this report states the position of the European Parliament on a proposal for a regulation amending the co-financing criteria to help the Member States establish an integrated management and control system for certain Community aid schemes."
"Parliament was asked to extend the co-financing period."
"The request reached us in April, four months after the deadline for the system to be operational, in principle, in all the Member States."
"So the Commission presented Parliament with a fait accompli . And that is hardly advisable, ladies and gentlemen, when we are talking about a system intended to control half the EAGGF agricultural expenditure, which represents about ECU 18, 000 million per year."
"In 1994 Parliament itself had already asked the Commission for a report on the operation of the integrated aid system. We gave it a year."
"Well, the report did not arrive."
"And to avoid the costs of the financial adjustments provided for by the existing regulation, should Member States fail to establish the system in time, the Commission confronts this Parliament with the dilemma of rejecting the extension of the co-financing - thus presenting the Commission and the Member States with an embarrassing problem - or condoning this behaviour and accepting the request for extension, even if amended."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control and this rapporteur decided to accept as sufficient the promises made in a letter from Commissioner Fischler that by 31 December this year, that is, a year later than should have been the case in theory, all the Member States except the three new ones would have this system up and running."
"However, by the time this report reached the November part-session for approval, the Court of Auditors had stated in its annual report that it would be difficult to get the system operational in all fifteen Member States during 1997."
"Italy and Greece would have particular problems."
"These delays are that much more serious the greater the EAGGF amounts to be controlled, and they are at the origin of possible irregularities, even fraud, and definite harm to European taxpayers."
"That is why one of the Amendments, No 2, calls for a general cut in monthly payments in advance to Member States where the integrated system is not in operation, as from 1 January 1997."
"The Council itself provided for and backed this measure in its Decision of 31 October 1994."
"On top of that, the Court of Auditors has severely criticized the Member States and the Commission, pointing out that neither the Commission nor the Council have ensured strict monitoring of statements of costs in relation to these co-financed systems."
"I can tell this House that we are talking about an amount of ECU 16.6 million which is at the very least under a question mark from the Court of Auditors."
"There is not even enough control over the money which is intended to improve the control itself."
"As always, whenever the Commission is asked to take responsibility and provide explanations, it has assured Parliament that from now on there will be strict monitoring."
"For that reason and that reason only, the Committee on Budgetary Control consents to the Commission's proposal and asks the European Parliament to approve the amendments we have tabled."
"Finally, I thank Commissioner Fischler for being here and I would like to hear him explain to this vast but attentive emptiness the grounds on which his representative gave guarantees to the Committee on Budgetary Control that there would be more efficient monitoring from now on."
"If the Commissioner can really guarantee that this control will be seriously monitored, we will at least have had a very useful sitting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you, Mr Garriga Polledo, for all your work and for your report, and also by thanking the committees involved for their constructive suggestions."
"I should like to comment on the amendments as follows, beginning with Amendments Nos 1 and 4 on co-financing: here the Commission agrees with Parliament that appropriations which are not utilized should not lapse, and it will do all it can in the Council to ensure that appropriations which are not taken up can be made available to other Member States."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 5, in the Commission's view a failure to implement certain parts of the Integrated System should be examined in the context of the relevant budget discipline and the regulations covering balancing of accounts."
"For this reason the Commission does not consider these amendments to be appropriate."
"With regard to Amendment No 3, I can confirm that the Commission has drafted a proposal for the introduction of a system for the identification and registration of cattle."
"The regulation which is proposed would replace the relevant provisions of Directive 92/102/EEC."
"This makes Amendment No 3 superfluous, but I can assure Parliament that the content of the proposed regulation is very much in line with the recommendations made."
"The Commission's proposals also stipulate that by 1 January 1998 a database must be set up in every Member State to store all the animals' identification numbers with age, sex and date of birth, together with details of their arrival at or departure from farms."
"The introduction of animal passports and enactment of regulations on ear tags are also included in the proposals."
"With regard to Amendment No 6, the Commission welcomes Parliament's desire to receive information from Member States on whether the Integrated System is operating effectively."
"I should, however, point out that since as far back as 1993 the annual report of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has included a special section covering this point."
"In the Commission's view, this amendment is, therefore, unnecessary."
"In any case it would be premature to draw up a report on the definitive implementation of the system before the middle of 1997, since it will be impossible to assess gaps in implementation in the three new Member States until the end of 1997 or 1998 at the earliest."
"Mr President, I just want to repeat that the rapporteur maintains all his amendments, especially the rejection of Amendment No 2."
"I just want to tell the Commissioner that I do not see how he is going to avoid making financial corrections for the Member States in settling the EAGGF accounts when the time comes."
"The issue does not have to be resolved now but we are obviously going to have a disagreement on this point in the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is responsible for analysis of the settlement of EAGGF accounts."
"Thank you very much, Mr Garriga Polledo."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Court of Auditor's report on Mostar"
"The next item is the report (A4-0386/96) by Mrs M√ºller, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Special Report No 2/96 of the Court of Auditors concerning the accounts of the Administrator and the European Union Administration, Mostar (EUAM), accompanied by the replies of the Commission and the Administrator of Mostar (C4-0513/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to begin by citing a figure which perhaps characterizes the current situation in Mostar more clearly than anything else could do."
"Since the beginning of this year, more than 70 people have been driven from their homes in western Mostar."
"All too often these expulsions continue to occur under the noses of police who are simply passive onlookers."
"Recently there have again been even more of them."
"The homes of those who have been driven out are then sold off in exchange for German currency by an avaricious Croat mafia."
"Only in six cases were the rightful owners or tenants able to reclaim their homes."
"These sad statistics show that the European Union has failed to achieve its political goal in Mostar."
"Genuine reunification of the city, a functioning joint administration and a common police force, full freedom of movement and the return of those who have been driven out - for the time being all that remains a pipe-dream."
"Many fear that the situation will deteriorate further when Sir Martin Garrod comes to the end of his term as the EU's special representative in the city just before Christmas."
"Despite this, the decision to draw a line under the action after two and a half years is the right one."
"The European Union has spent almost ECU 150 million on Mostar during these two and a half years."
"Thanks to this aid, the city has been given a head start, and reconstruction is much further advanced here than elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina - local elections were in fact already held last summer."
"Whether the local politicians on both sides in Mostar will build on this head start in the common interest, or whether they will throw it all away again, is now largely in their own hands."
"The current protests and demonstrations in Belgrade are giving rise to some encouragement since they show that there is also reason to hope for a change for the better."
"What are the lessons to be learned from this, the first major joint action we have undertaken under the common foreign and security policy?"
"The goal we set ourselves for Mostar was to achieve reconciliation following a savage civil war."
"And it was surely not a mistake for us to attempt to do something which was virtually impossible in the short term."
"However, we have to acknowledge that we did not do everything that could have been done if we were to come close to achieving this goal."
"In particular, we failed to equip the administrator with full executive powers."
"As Mr Koschnick said at the hearing held by the Committee on Budgetary Control, ' I was able to make all the decisions but accomplish nothing.'"
"In its special report, the European Court of Auditors documented a long list of omissions and shortcomings."
"It was not, however, in Mostar itself that the crucial errors occurred - there Hans Koschnick and his successors, together with their colleagues, worked with great personal commitment and at great risk to themselves; the most serious errors occurred in Brussels and in the Foreign Ministries of the Member States."
"At the crucial moment, after Mr Koschnick had nearly been lynched under the noses of police who simply looked on passively, the pressure which needed to be put on the Croatian politicians responsible was not applied."
"For the sake of a dubious compromise with these politicians, the Foreign Ministers accepted Mr Koschnick's resignation."
"However, Mr Koschnick and his comrades-in-arms in Mostar were also victims of the completely inappropriate decision-making and administrative procedures of the common foreign and security policy, a travelling circus of political responsibility - every six months the contacts changed with the Council presidency."
"An advisory working party set up to support the presidency carried decisions over from one meeting to the next."
"An absurdly complicated procedure for releasing appropriations and making them available meant that for months on end the EU administration was only able to pay its bills very late. Hans Koschnick summed up his experience as follows: ' on the one hand, unimpeachably good intentions on the part of all those involved in the EU, and on the other, unimaginable obstructionism' ."
"Have the lessons at least now been learned?"
"It seems unlikely."
"For one thing, it is unfortunate that the Council refused to have anything to do with the contradictory procedure and was conspicuous by its absence from the discussions of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Now, in the context of the intergovernmental conference, it is making proposals which - I cannot put it any other way - constitute an attack on the rights of Parliament."
"The non-compulsory expenditure under the common foreign and security policy is to be made compulsory, which would eliminate the only genuine right of co-determination and monitoring which Parliament has in the field of foreign policy."
"It is a mockery for the Council to talk about getting closer to the people and greater transparency if, at the same time, it lapses back into the pose of an absolute ruler in a field as important as foreign policy."
"Mr President, there is a certain irony that this is the last debate of 1996 in this Chamber because at the end of 1996 the EU administration in Mostar also comes to an end and I rather suspect we may have to return to debating Mostar in the new year."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and wide-ranging report."
"There are many lessons to be learned from the EU administration in Mostar."
"Most of them are political lessons."
"The main objective of this report was to look at budgetary and financial questions."
"But politics set the framework in which financial management can operate and what this report shows about the EU administration in Mostar is that there was a lack of clarity, a lack of coherence, a lack of consistency and a lack of clearly-defined objectives."
"That reveals to me the importance of reaching agreement in the intergovernmental conference on having a unit responsible for common foreign and security policy whose job it is to identify the long-term problems confronting the European Union and strategies for dealing with those problems and also personnel for dealing with these problems."
"As Mrs M√ºller has pointed out one of the problems was that Member States sent people off to Mostar without regard for whether they could do the job that was needed."
"That was one of the problems the administration had to face."
"There was also clearly a lack of a clearly-defined line of command in Mostar."
"As Mrs M√ºller has also pointed out, every time the presidency changed so did the people responsible for Mostar in the Council of Ministers change."
"What we therefore need is somebody responsible for the foreign and security policy who would be the same person regardless of what the presidency is."
"That would enable us to have a clearer line of command."
"But most importantly, paragraph 9 of the resolution, highlights the fact that the pillar structure of the Maastricht Treaty has left huge gaps and areas where there are doubts about demarcation, about responsibility, about coordination."
"We really have to clarify in relation to EU external policy who does what, when and how, and who they are accountable to."
"Otherwise we will repeat the mistakes of Mostar."
"We should also be drawing attention to Article J.3 of the Maastricht Treaty which says once a common action has been agreed unanimously in the Council of Ministers, it is possible to use qualified majority voting to carry out that joint action."
"One of the problems in Mostar was that at one point it seemed that every decision, down to the buttons on the police uniform, were having to be referred back to the Council of Ministers for unanimous decision."
"You cannot operate this sort of administration on that basis."
"Mrs M√ºller also made reference to the financing."
"You cannot finance an action by passing the hat round between Member States in the hope that they will come up with money, and more importantly, that they will come up with the money when they say they will come up with the money."
"Far too often money did not materialize."
"These sort of actions have to be financed out of the EU budget, which will then give the European Parliament its proper role as the authority of accountability."
"There is no doubt that Mostar was successful in terms of physical reconstruction."
"I have been there and I have seen the extensive progress that was made but it was not successful in terms of political reconstruction."
"We must learn the lessons that are clearly set out in Mrs M√ºller's report."
"I personally have tremendous admiration for the work of the people on the ground."
"That admiration does not extend to the people they were responsible to."
"I will finish by making reference to a famous book in Spanish which you will be familiar with, written by somebody quite closely connected to the man who may next be President of the European Parliament."
"It says peace was not possible."
"I would say to you in relation to Mostar that political reconstruction was not possible and it will not be possible until we identify very clearly who should do what, when they should do it and how they should do it."
"Let us hope we learn those lessons."
"Mr President, first I want to thank you very much indeed for your kind words about my speech in Spanish, and I promise that next time I prepare a speech with Mrs Ferrer I shall try to do it in Catalan to support that important language in the culture of Europe."
"If I may, I should like to continue in German, and to begin by telling Mr Titley that I am actually glad this debate on Mostar is being held today, as the last debate this year, as I hope it will serve as a sign for the future, in terms of the tasks we must continue to undertake and the goals we must achieve in the former Yugoslavia in the next few years."
"In principle I am very pleased that this report has been presented to us, and I am also pleased that it is a critical one."
"I probably do not agree with Mrs M√ºller on every point, but I am glad all the same that the points have been so clearly made."
"However, I wish to emphasize above all that in my view it was enormously important for the European Union at least to fly the flag in Mostar, particularly in view of the number of times when it has been expected to help and has done nothing."
"I am also firmly convinced that the EU administrator Hans Koschnick, the former Mayor of Bremen, has achieved a very great deal."
"I was able to visit him on a number of occasions and was able to see at first hand the progress made there, as Mr Titley described it."
"It was very interesting to notice in my discussions with him the way he frequently emphasized how much he had learned from studying history, particularly from studying the Moravian agreement of 1906, which was Europe's first example of how a legal basis can be secured for the peaceful coexistence of peoples and ethnic groups with equal rights."
"However, I should also like to point out that Mr Koschnick's activities and tasks really came to grief at the point when he stopped keeping to the principles of the Moravian agreement."
"For me, however, Mostar is also a clear example demonstrating that much that was resolved in the Dayton Agreement was incapable of leading to the establishment of a goal simply because many of those involved were not willing to put the required effort into backing it and working on it."
"Please allow me to take this opportunity of citing two brief examples of human rights which merit a mention in this context."
"The first is that of Father Matanovi, the Catholic priest who, with his parents, is still being held prisoner by the Bosnian Serb army; Bishop Komarica of Banjaluka is continuing to draw attention to this, and has established where he is being held."
"No practical steps are being taken to obtain his release, which would also help to implement the Dayton Agreement."
"The second case is that of Colonel Peresyn, who was shot down in the liberation of Western Slavonia, landed in an area occupied by the Serbs, and is still languishing in prison today."
"Although his precise whereabouts are known, nothing is being done to help him."
"I believe that all this serves as a signal to us that we as a college have a duty to concentrate more in the next few years on our responsibilities to the states adjoining the EU, to remember our European responsibilities, and to give our support to the former Yugoslavia."
"Thank you very much, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen."
"I think those were your first two speeches in this House."
"So I want to welcome your participation and I feel sure that your views will be a valuable addition to our debates."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a kind of compensation I should like to speak in English now."
"The Commission greatly appreciates the fact that both the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the European Court of Auditors have taken an early, active and, I would add, supportive interest in this first major CFSP joint action of the European Union."
"The Commission, as well as the Union Administration in their joint official reply to the Court of Auditors' report, have expressed their basic agreement with its findings and recommendations."
"Mrs M√ºller's report broadly endorses these findings by elaborating on the mainly institutional lessons which should be drawn from this unique experience."
"We share the conclusion of the motion for a resolution that this joint action was justified and worthwhile, although not all its goals have been achieved and that it provides valuable lessons for the future."
"This is not the place to discuss in detail all the points stressed by the resolution, many of which are indeed on the agenda of the IGC and all need careful consideration."
"Certainly, political and administrative procedures need streamlining in the future."
"Financial accountability has to be clarified."
"Proper preparation, follow-up and supervision by a permanent structure could greatly improve efficiency."
"The same is true of exclusive financing from the Community budget."
"Recommendation No 14 encourages the Commission to propose new joint actions in the former Yugoslavia, in particular for the return of refugees and support for independent media."
"The Commission is, however, of the opinion that with the exception of support for the Office of the High Representative, it has sufficient instruments and budget resources under the first pillar to meet well-identified needs."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I find it very sad that our final debate concerns a failure of EU policy in which so many people have invested much energy and Mr Koschnick personally has risked so much."
"This first project was to have been a model of the common foreign policy."
"Well, our efforts in reconstruction have to some degree been successful, but our political efforts have not been at all."
"Partly thanks to an unclear division of powers over the allocation of funds at decisive moments with Council and Commission decisions contradicting each other."
"I will not go into the details."
"The Court of Auditors and Mrs M√ºller have done an excellent job."
"But what is clear is that the Union is struggling over its foreign policy."
"This report by the Court of Auditors is thus politically heavily loaded and Parliament cannot allow that to happen in future."
"It cannot be allowed to get through the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference on the nod."
"Otherwise Parliament will look foolish."
"This has to be followed up."
"Happy Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"Thank you very much, Mrs van Bladel."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I expect you have all realized that I am a lucky Vice-President."
"Today the Rules give me the last word in this year's session, looking towards the future, but I also get the last word in the first half of the legislature and the last word from the Vice-Presidency I belong to."
"So first let me wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"About a year ago I was also lucky enough to close last year's session and I did so in common accord with you, using words borrowed from the Christian culture which unite believers and non-believers: peace on earth, goodwill to all people."
"Unfortunately we have not enjoyed that peace this year."
"Conflicts continue, and there have been many, and I know when I wish you happiness it is under something of a cloud reminding us that there are indeed many conflicts still, including the bloody and tragic conflict in one part of Africa."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, in bringing this first half of the legislature to a close, I must congratulate and thank all the staff and all the Members of this Parliament."
"First, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the ushers who carry out their duties with such discretion."
"Thanks too, to the officers who put together the Sitting Info and the Rainbow behind this backdrop, day after day; those working on the former demonstrate an enviable capacity for synthesis and while the others - it has to be said - are like good make-up artists dealing with our speeches so that we hardly realize they have been touched."
"Thanks too, ladies and gentlemen, to the interpreters, whom we subject to constant tension with speeches that have to be hurried to save a few seconds, making them breathless as they work."
"And if I may so say, very often - at times, certainly - they also have to make sense of speeches that were incomprehensible in the original language."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my thanks also go to the Presidency's staff."
"When a mandate ends there is a tendency to be brutally frank."
"So I am going to admit that when something goes wrong in this Parliament it is because the Presidents make a mess of the good work done by the Presidency's officers."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to all of you."
"I do not think there are good or bad presidents."
"There are good or bad meetings."
"I have had the great good fortune to have good meetings every time."
"So as sincerity demands simplicity, thank you, thank you very much."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 13 December 1996."
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again our Parliament is meeting to appoint officers for the next six-month legislative term."
"As the oldest Member, it is my duty to open this sitting and since I am easily the oldest Member of all, I would like, if you permit me, to make a very brief personal statement."
"I am the only person left in this House who was born before the first world war and can therefore remember this epoch-making event from my own experience."
"I am from an era that was shaped by the Vienna Congress at the end of the Napoleonic Wars."
"For it is to that Congress that we owe the long period of peace that gave rise to the astonishing economic upswing of that era, which had both its bright and its dark sides."
"I personally experienced three world wars, for after all what is called the cold war was nothing other than the third world war."
"And I witnessed two godforsaken and inhumane totalitarian dictatorships - under Stalin, who succeeded Lenin, and Hitler - their rise to power and their terrible demise."
"At that time I was fortunate enough to be able to work with important men who have done much for our continent."
"The first was the prophet of Europe, Richard von CoudenhoveKalergi, founder of the Pan-European Union, who warned us as even in 1922 that Europe would suffer severely if it did not unite in time."
"He and Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann only just missed achieving their aim."
"Had they succeeded, we would have been saved millions of deaths and endless human and material losses."
"I was also lucky enough to be involved in the efforts of statesmen such as Robert Schuman, Josef Bech, Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle and Franz Josef Strauss."
"Finally, I had the good fortune to conclude a long career by representing Bavaria in the European Parliament for 18 years."
"A wonderful time, in which I always had the feeling that our work is meaningful, quite apart from leading to friendships between many people, from many nations and parties, who are united by their understanding of the meaning and task of Europe in the years to come."
"Looking back over nearly the entire span of the 20th century, allow me to make two comments."
"I am doing so partly in memory of one of the best speeches I ever heard in this House, the opening address by the first oldest Member, that great French lady Louise Weiss, which we would still do well to read today."
"We are facing a time of historical change, which is opening up new horizons."
"Distance, space and time have now acquired an entirely new meaning compared to a few decades ago."
"Our living conditions have changed radically."
"Relations between peoples and nations are not what they were only a few decades ago."
"That means we have to re-think our policies."
"We are in the midst of a crisis - I am using this word in the Chinese sense, meaning a great danger but also a great opportunity."
"That means we have an enormous responsibility, we who have the honour to be Members of the only European democratically elected body."
"We cannot shift this responsibility onto others, for each and every one of us took on their task of their own free will in accepting to stand for the European Parliament."
"So we have a duty towards those who have placed their trust in us."
"We must do all we can to fulfil it."
"Personal and private interests must take second place."
"We owe our voters and the European ideal total commitment."
"If we are to be credible, there can be no justification for not appearing on working days, including Fridays - you will allow me to say this, it is a hobbyhorse of mine."
"Of course there can be cases of force majeure , but they must remain rare exceptions."
"We have a historic responsibility towards all Europeans so long as we see the European Union as more than a large market and a rich nations' club."
"Our united Europe must be home to all Europeans, including those who do not yet belong to it but want to help build it."
"Our doors must always remain open to them."
"We must insist that as soon as they comply with the basic conditions for accession they have a right immediately to become Member States of the European Union."
"That is not just a duty, it is also in our interests."
"An eminent Member of the European Parliament and a colleague of many of us, Dr Heinrich Aigner, put it this way: ' Europe offers the only realistic prospect for peace!'"
"Europe is not just Paris, London, Madrid, Rome, Berlin, Luxembourg, Brussels, the Hague, Lisbon, Vienna, Helsinki, Dublin, Copenhagen, Athens or Stockholm; it is also Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, Ljubljana, Vilnius, Riga, Tallin, Bratislava, Zagreb, Bucharest, Kiev, Skopje, Sofia, Sarajevo, Tirana, Vaduz, La Valletta, Nicosia, Oslo, Berne and Belgrade."
"A Europe that is uniting must also be open to the citizens of these towns and to the inhabitants of the Central and Eastern European countries."
"The European Union must not turn into a private club for the more fortunate nations, as the Czech president V√°clav Havel recently warned."
"We would be betraying the European ideal if, now that the military 'iron curtain' has gone, we allowed a new rich-poor divide to come into being."
"People say that enlargement will cost us dear."
"Of course, all good things are costly, but in a dangerous world the first priority is security, and only a united Europe can give us that."
"We have learned from experience that one day of war costs more in terms of human misery and economic loss than a whole years expenditure on peace-keeping."
"And there is a wise French proverb that goes: ' Plaie d'argent n'est jamais mortelle.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an enormous task before us."
"We in this House are called to make history."
"We owe that to our people and to each of our voters."
"We must fulfil this obligation."
"It is a splendid but also a difficult task."
"Much will be decided over the next two and a half years."
"And we bear the responsibility for it."
"I hope God will bless us in our pursuit, us and the men and women who will be appointed to high offices in the coming hours."
"And now to work!"
"(Applause)"
"Election of the President (announcement of nominations and appointment of tellers)"
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, the election of the President will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Let me remind you that under the Rules of Procedure no business can be transacted while the oldest Member is in the Chair unless it is concerned with the election of the President or the verification of credentials."
"Pursuant to Rule 13 of the Rules, nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament may only be made by a political group or by at least 29 Members."
"I have received the following nominations in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure:"
"Mr GIL-ROBLES GIL-DELGADO Mrs LALUMIERE"
"May I remind you that pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules, in order to be elected a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast in the first three ballots."
"Blank or spoilt papers do not count as votes cast."
"In order to speed up tomorrow morning's proceedings, I propose that we now appoint the six tellers."
"(The President drew lots to appoint the tellers)"
"The following Members are appointed tellers:"
"Mr De Vries Mr Tajani Mrs Thors Mrs Thyssen Mr Tamino Mr Virrankoski"
"Mr President, I should just like to thank you for selecting the tellers as you have. You have short-circuited the d'Hondt system and shown that tellers do not always have to be selected from the two largest groups."
"Thank you very much."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.20 p.m.)"
"Election of the President"
"The next item is the election of the President, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Envelopes and ballot papers have been distributed."
"As I said yesterday, I have received the following nominations, in accordance with the provisions of the Rules: Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mrs Lalumi√®re."
"Let me remind you that pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules, to be elected a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of votes cast after the first three ballots."
"Blank or spoilt papers do not count as votes cast."
"I declare the first ballot open."
"(The Members of the European Parliament proceeded to the ballot boxes)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.45 a.m.)"
"Mr President, my congratulations and I wish you all of God's blessings and great success in your work."
"Please come to the rostrum."
"Mr President, I rise on behalf of the Socialist Group to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this House."
"You take on the presidency at a moment of great responsibility, bearing in mind what lies before us in the European Union in the coming years."
"You have to follow a very illustrious act on the part of my very good colleague Klaus H√§nsch."
"I was asked just now by the media what I expect of the President of this Parliament."
"I would like to repeat what I said because I think you will be able to fulfil those expectations in great measure and we on this side of the House look forward to that."
"My reply was that I expect the President of this House to preside over this House with integrity."
"We believe you will do so."
"I also said that we expect the President of this House to pursue the demands of this House with great vigour, particularly in the light of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Again, we know and expect that you will do so."
"Thirdly, my third expectation of a President of this House is that he make this Parliament more relevant and more accessible to the people of the European Union, making it more user-friendly and more people-friendly."
"We know and expect that you will do that."
"You have our best wishes and, where you act in accordance with those three requests, which I know you will do, you will have our absolute support."
"We hope and expect that, in carrying out that duty, you will feel fulfilled and gratified in the post you have taken on. Mr President, we wish you well."
"Mr President, your election as President of the European Parliament is a cause of great delight to our Group."
"We have always admired your integrity and it is our belief, our conviction, that you will make an outstanding President of this House and a worthy successor to Klaus H√§nsch."
"The European Parliament has very specific responsibilities in the process of further integrating Europe, particularly since the Single Act and the Maastricht Treaty."
"Those who voted for you, and we make no secret of the fact that there was consensus between the Socialist Group and the EPP Group, did so because you will also be the personification of this desire for further integration and Parliament's responsibilities to help achieve that end."
"We are also delighted because, as you yourself said, you have been able to make a solid contribution to the furtherance of democracy in your own country."
"I was personally acquainted with your father and met him at meetings in Madrid in the seventies."
"We are especially pleased and we are convinced that those who chose you in preference to the other candidate, Mrs Lalumi√®re, will find you to be an honest, correct and very upright President."
"On behalf of the EPP Group I wish you the very best and a very successful term as President of the European Parliament in the crucial months which will take us up to the Intergovernmental Conference and which will, I hope, see the good results of that conference implemented."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, I offer my sincerest and warmest congratulations on your election, which gives us very special pleasure."
"Your personality, your uprightness, your standing as an eminent jurist and the personal courage you have displayed at a difficult time in your country's history all seem to us to guarantee your success in discharging the high office to which you have been appointed."
"However, Mr President, I am sure you will understand that, addressing you as I do after the Chairmen of the Socialist and PPE Groups, I must express very strongly the sense of frustration experienced by all the other political groups when it comes to appointing candidates to positions of responsibility in this Parliament."
"Since 1989, a reciprocal agreement between the two largest groups in the European Parliament has guaranteed that their candidate for the office of President will be elected on the first ballot, reducing any candidates from the other groups to the status of walk-on parts."
"In other words, the real election no longer takes place in the plenary but within each of the two largest groups in strict alternation."
"Not only that, but within the two largest groups the result of the voting is determined by the largest delegations, which reduces the effective electoral power still further."
"And, for good measure, this system was extended in 1994 to include the Quaestors, making it impossible for anyone outside the two main groups to be elected to that office either."
"The effect of this kind of system is to kick into touch six political groups out of eight - and yet those six groups account for 40 % of the Members of this House."
"(Applause) Furthermore, another effect of this kind of system is the ruthless elimination from positions of responsibility of the elected representatives of the least numerous nationalities within Parliament, which is out of step with the European ethos that gives equal rights to every nation represented in this House."
"So, Mr President, I urgently make the following request: that you use the moral authority conferred upon you by your election to take the initiative and, in consultation with the group chairmen, to come up with a procedure which will not perpetuate the present system - a system which, by over-organizing the internal democracy, has ultimately suppressed it."
"It would be a paradox indeed if the European Parliament, which has so often deplored the lack of democratic process in the functioning of the European institutions, should itself exacerbate the problem by its own internal procedures."
"Still with the same aim of making good the shortcomings of institutional democracy, Mr President, there are two other brief requests I should like to make."
"The first is that you should ensure that the decisions taken by the political organs of Parliament - the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents - should be precisely and promptly implemented by the administration, which has not always been the case in the past."
"The second is that you should take steps to improve cooperation, which already exists but still leaves much to be desired, with all the national parliaments, with whom we share the democratic legitimacy derived from election by universal suffrage."
"Why not arrange further talks with the representatives of the Union's national parliaments, like those we held in Rome a few years ago?"
"Mr President, I can assure you that you will have the support of our group in your everyday duties, and you can count on us when it comes to carrying out the reforms that are close to our hearts."
"Good luck, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on behalf of my entire Group I wish you all success and congratulate you warmly on your election to this high office."
"Mr President, we know you to be a man of integrity, as Mrs Green and Mr Martens have just said, and as a dedicated man."
"I have every confidence that you will in this new office speak for the whole House, for all members irrespective of nationality or group."
"When I came to our Group, Mr President, you said  ºI am a free man."
"I do not think', you said,  ºthat I shall stand for election again."
"So I shall be free and independent'."
"These, Mr President, are two of the most important qualities you will bring to your office."
"This House needs independence in its President and the strength which goes with it."
"Europe needs independence in the President of Parliament and the power of his vision."
"Your job, Mr President, is one of the finest political posts one can hold here in Europe."
"Because this House and you in particular embody the desire for tolerance and the desire for reconciliation amongst our peoples."
"So speak for us to the heads of government so that this desire for reconciliation, for tolerance and cooperation is heard more loudly."
"We ask you, Mr President, to speak for our voters who are so often regarded as unimportant at government conferences."
"We ask you to voice the concerns of our citizens, 20 million of whom are without work in this Europe of ours."
"We ask you to express the hope of our people for one Europe, West and East, a Europe which will resolutely fight the scourges of our time: unemployment, crime, environmental pollution, racism, nationalism."
"But, Mr President, above all we ask you to be forceful, not just to carry on with  ºbusiness as usual', but to be one of the two people who embody Europe in the eyes of the people: you and the president of the Commission are both seen as  ºMr Europe'."
"I am certain that you will be worthy of this office."
"I will end, Mr President, with a warning, a warning to my friends and colleagues in the two main groups."
"Nearly a third of the members of this House opted in this election for a choice which was on the one hand a protest vote and on the other hand a tribute to Mrs Lalumi√®re's courage in standing."
"Do not forget, ladies and gentlemen, do not forget that the essence of a democracy is not that what the majority says, goes."
"The essence of a democracy is how the majority treats minorities and I urge the House to remember that tradition."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our responsibility to be the voice of democracy on the continent of Europe, and that responsibility must extend to the way in which we conduct our own internal affairs."
"Mr President, we put our faith in you, we put our hope in you, we wish you a presidency informed by humour, wisdom and courage."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to begin by congratulating you on behalf of all our Group and making a pledge to you to develop the good impetus which already came from the previous president, Mr H√§nsch, and which we positively enhanced."
"Perhaps, however, my words are of small yet double importance since I am the President of one of the minority groups which listened to the two candidates: the candidate who has been elected President and also the excellent other candidate, Mrs Catherine Lalumi√®re."
"We listened to them and we spoke with both candidates and therefore we left freedom of vote to all members of our Group."
"This was an especially free vote, a very reflective one, and I think it was a divided vote in our Group; some of us voted for the candidate who was elected and others voted for Mrs Catherine Lalumi√®re and, given this pluralism, I think that we have some authority to criticize the election system which has already been criticized here today."
"It is a model which hugely predetermines the ability to be elected President of the European Parliament."
"It is a model of mechanical alternation between the two majority groups of the European Parliament."
"It is an interpretation of Rule 17 which we should consider once again, on which we should work once again, in order to guarantee as much as possible that the election of the Presidency of the European Parliament should reflect as far as possible that person's political ability to represent as far as possible all European citizens."
"But I must also say, as President of this Group that, in the end, the members voted in freedom, in a secret ballot, with a responsible vote and that the elected candidate has obtained a majority of votes at the first round."
"And the fact that I can speak to you in Spanish and that we come from the same Spanish background I hope will be well seen by my colleagues in the Group who are of various nationalities."
"Here we have very much taken into account all of your previous political and professional life, Mr Gil-Robles."
"Coming from the Spanish Left I put my faith in this hemicycle of the greatest European representation in the active promise made by Mr Gil-Robles to fight the Franco dictatorship which lasted for forty years. An active promise both in exile and inside the country."
"But this is not enough to be elected President of the European Parliament."
"As a member of the European Parliament and Group President, I can give testimony to the work carried out by Mr Gil-Robles as Chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, as Vice-President of the European Parliament, a dimension of his pro-European fight over many years in the European Federal Movement - a critical pro-European at that - which has put this man at the centre of the importance of European construction."
"That is why today, briefly - because it is not up to Group Presidents to work out the political projects of the recently elected President or to take his place, since tomorrow he will be delivering his presidential speech - but I should just like to say that our pledge and our congratulations come together with a double plea which I should like to make now: we want him to represent the whole of the European Parliament with the greatest dignity and effectiveness vis-√†-vis the other institutions."
"It is the moment of the European Parliament in this difficult European construction when we must pay the various socio-economic and political bills in order to achieve harmonisation among the peoples and institutions of Europe."
"And finally I should also like him to defend participatory democracy, to bring the European Parliament closer to the citizens, to end propaganda, to end contradictory information so that we can hold up to all of the people of Europe our visions of Europe, in all the countries, and make a pledge to political ideology."
"In the knowledge that the recently elected President is not a sectarian politician, I know that he will accept the compromise of the different political groups which think in a different way to him."
"We must congratulate him and we shall promise to help him in his task."
"Good luck and success to the President, to the European Parliament and to the European Union!"
"Mr President, as Chairman of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, I too should like to offer my congratulations on your election, and to wish you luck."
"I have no doubt that you will be an objective, open-minded and tolerant President, and that you will respect the rights of the minorities in this Parliament."
"However, the number of votes cast in my favour - a number far exceeding, as you will agree, the size of my group - must be seen as an expression of discontent, a protest vote. Not a protest against yourself, Mr President, but a protest against a system which, over the years, has become more and more rigid and cumbersome and, it must be said, contrary to the principles of democracy."
"I believe this message must be heeded."
"It was, after all, the reason for my candidacy."
"I knew well enough what the result of the ballot would be, but I believed, and still do, that we should reform the rules - not just the written rules but the practice that has grown up over recent years."
"Indeed, listening to other members, Mr Pasty for example, I noticed that this discontent exists even among those who voted for you."
"That means that there really is a problem, and I appeal to the sense of justice of the largest groups, and to your own, Mr President, to see to it that we address the reform of this system as soon as possible."
"For the present, I wish you every success, for yourself, Mr President, and for the European Parliament, which needs to strengthen its political role on the international stage. I also wish you every success as a representative of the European Union, which needs people to represent its image with authority throughout the world."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate you on your election, on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations."
"I can promise that there will be loyal support from some sections of the Maastricht opposition, not for the Maastricht II treaty, but for a democratic debate on this amongst all viewpoints here in Parliament and for applying democratic rules to that debate, so that both decentralizers and centralizers, federalists and supporters of parliamentary democracy, can have a fair and open discussion with equal resources for the different viewpoints, and then a democratic decision through referendums in the various countries."
"I also promise my support for cleaning up the allowances and travel expenses and for creating democracy and fairness within Parliament itself, including a much-needed reform of the d'Hondt system, so that the two large groups - the PPE and PSE Groups - can have exactly the quota of chairman and vicechairman posts corresponding to their membership, and so that the quota of posts to which the small groups together are entitled are actually given to the small groups, which can then distribute this amongst themselves."
"The procedure of creating such small quotas under the d'Hondt system that the smaller groups are left with nothing is deeply undemocratic, and I hope that you, with your background of taking part in the campaign against the lack of democracy in Spain, will be the person who can carry through democracy and fair rules in relation to the larger groups."
"Today, unfortunately, the fact is that you were not elected simply because of your personal qualities."
"I should have liked to be able to congratulate you on being elected on that basis, but the way in which you have been elected is one that we know from a world other than that of popularly elected assemblies."
"It is a method familiar to us from the business world, under the term 'holding company' ."
"You take the support of the two largest subgroups within the two largest groups, and then with a minority of members you have a decision which is not necessarily in accordance with the wishes of the majority."
"The holding company model has no place in an assembly elected by the people, and I would hope that next time we shall have a different, democratic method of election, so that you, for instance, can also be elected in the light of your personal qualities."
"Today, the fact is that we would have to leave it to the drawing of lots by the notary public for all Members to have the same chance of being elected to your post."
"Welcome to the job of President of Parliament, however."
"I see you as the common representative of all of us, and I can promise you the support of my group over the next two and a half years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to address you as the chairman of my group, which is not recognized as a group because it has too few members, but I should like to tell you how much we appreciate the undertakings you have given to this House."
"As many previous speakers have emphasized, however, the large number of votes cast in favour of Mrs Lalumi√®re reflected the deep sense of frustration within this House."
"There is no doubt that the complicity that has grown up between the two largest groups, which should naturally be competitors within this House, is a clear cause of concern regarding our perception of the way this institution should function."
"And I would remind you that every Member of this House has the same dignity and the same rights, through his electors, and the right to the same consideration as any other Member."
"The parliamentary groups are, basically, procedural instruments to facilitate the proper functioning of Parliament, but the large number of non-attached Members are deprived of their right to express the views of their constituents."
"That is why, despite the respect we have for you personally, we felt it important to demonstrate our opposition to this method by voting for Mrs Lalumi√®re, inspired by the same principles to which she herself referred in connection with her candidacy."
"Unfortunately, any hope we might have of more democratic conditions founders on what we hear of the representation on Parliament's delegations and committees."
"Let me give you one simple example."
"We have in our group a former head of faculty, a Professor of Japanese Civilization and Language."
"He was a member of the delegation for relations with Japan."
"He has just been removed from it."
"That seems to me a poor testimony to correct procedure and democratic intent."
"However, Mr President, we congratulate you on your election, because it is a traditional courtesy, and we hope that you will show the same consideration for all Members of this Parliament, whatever their nationality and whatever the political opinion they express."
"It is no secret that we are opponents of a federal Europe and defenders of a confederal Europe."
"We believe that we must be free to express that opinion here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and on my own personal behalf I too should like to offer you my very sincere congratulations on your election as President of the European Parliament."
"You are taking over from Klaus H√§nsch, a great president, and I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a heartfelt and sincere tribute to him for his effective, efficient, determined and courageous presidency."
"Mr President, you have been elected to your high office at a time when the European Union is confronted by many challenges."
"Your mandate will take you through to the next European elections, in 1999, when all Europe's citizens will be called upon to elect their representatives."
"A Europe that is close to the citizen - that is our ambition and our desire."
"And I have no doubt that, with the impetus you provide, Europe's citizens will be able to identify with this institution, which must be at the heart of the European democratic structure."
"As you carry out your duties, Mr President, you will always be able to rely on the faithful, loyal and direct support, assistance and cooperation of the members and President of the Commission."
"Mr President, in view of some of the speeches we have heard here this morning I feel it is important to rise again because people listening in the gallery and the media have heard some very strange interpretations of representative democracy here this morning."
"I must say to you that through their acceptance of the use of the d'Hondt system and other concessions they voluntarily make to the smaller groups in this House, the two big groups of this House are..."
"(Heckling ) We will wait for the barracking to stop."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I respect your opinion. So please show the same respect for others."
"Please continue, Mrs Green."
"The two large groups in this House already make considerable concessions to the smaller groups."
"I was disappointed that in the speeches by the other group leaders there was no recognition of that fact, after all the discussions we have gone through in the last few weeks."
"I would say as well that in any parliamentary democracy it is the majority in the House that determines who should hold the presidency."
"That is what has prevailed here today."
"I would like to conclude by saying to Mr Pasty in particular that when he gave the figures, which were quite misleading, he obviously had not looked at the nominations that have come forward, particularly from my group, because he would have noticed that of the three places for quaestor which we hold we have ceded one to a smaller group in this House and will be supporting a candidate from the GUE."
"I will tell you as well that when you talk of small delegations, my group is nominating a Member from a four-person Finnish delegation in my group as a quaestor of this House."
"So when he says smaller delegations inside the big groups are being denied their rights, he is quite wrong."
"I would say to you, colleagues, that we are nominating a Finn as well as another Member for a quaestorship in this House."
"I assume from what Mr Pasty has said in support of small delegations that he and his group will support our Finn for quaestorship."
"(Applause )"
"Mr Martens, there is no question of holding a debate on this."
"I shall just give you the floor for one minute, given the allusions that you have been making."
"I did not realize it was intended to hold a discussion here on the fundamental rules which apply in this Parliament and which are not those of dictatorship by the majority groups, certainly not."
"We do not operate a  ºwinner takes all' system; our system is that the various groups are fairly represented in the share-out of responsibilities and the vote we are about to have on Parliament's vice-presidents proves that, since the various groups have all agreed that candidates from smaller groups should also have a chance."
"So it would not, I think, be appropriate to abandon this principle, this system of giving a seat to the smaller groups and smaller delegations within the groups."
"We have always said that we are amenable to amendments of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, but I would emphasize that here in this multicultural Parliament which has members from 15 Member States we apply a system which is fair and which, compared to other systems, is thus in my view the best method for this Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not go on with this matter."
"It is traditional for this set of speeches to be used to congratulate the President-elect in a courteous way."
"Of course this President-elect could not cut off the expressions of those who find fault with the way in which he was elected, and nor has he done so."
"But we cannot drift away from the agenda which now obliges us to proceed to the election of the Vice-Presidents."
"I therefore wind up this debate and, if you all agree, proceed to the election of the Vice-Presidents."
"Election of the Vice-Presidents"
"The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents."
"The following nominations have been received:"
"Mr Anastassopoulos Mr Avgerinos Mr Capucho Mrs Fontaine Mr Guti√©rrez D√≠az Mr Haarder Mrs Hoff Mr Imbeni Mr Marinho Mr Martin Mrs P√©ry Mr Podest√† Mrs Schleicher Mr Verde i Aldea"
"The candidates have informed me that they agree to stand."
"(The vote took place) We shall now scrutinize the vote."
"The results of the count will be announced this afternoon at 3 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your election."
"On a point of order, can you ensure that the ballot boxes are opened simultaneously rather than some being opened before others?"
"This issue caused some problems today between myself and some members of staff, and I do not want a repeat of this."
"Thank you very much, Mr Falconer."
"You are quite right and I thank you for drawing our attention to this matter."
"I should like to ask the five elections officers, each of whom is responsible for one ballot box, to make sure that they are not opened until the President says that the voting is open and that they should be opened simultaneously."
"Before I open the vote I should remind you that if seven Vice-Presidents are not elected in the second round we shall obviously have to have a third round. We set out with a view that we maintain these candidacies for the remaining posts."
"However, if there were any change I would communicate it to you by the deadline for submitting nominations, which is at 4.45 p.m."
"As for the election of Quaestors, I propose that we set the deadline for nominations at 4 p.m. today."
"Is there any objection? There is no objection, so this is agreed."
"(The vote took place) May I ask the election officers to go to Room 3 on the second floor to count the votes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I rise under Rule 13(3) which says: ' In the election of the President, Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, account should be taken of the need to ensure an overall fair representation of Member States and political views' ."
"The way we are going we will have no representation in the Bureau of the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden or Austria."
"I would urge all Members of the House to ask themselves if that is a sensible way to conduct democracy in Europe?"
"It is not good enough!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, obviously all members of the European Parliament know Rule 13(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"It demands that each and every Member State be represented in the running of this Assembly."
"However, it is a general principle that we practise this by a method adopted by the majority of the Assembly, i.e. according to a democratically approved rule."
"Before continuing, I should like to ask you whether anyone opposes the use of electronic voting."
"It appears not."
"However, we now have three candidates - Mr Capucho, Mr Haarder and Mr Podest√† - and we shall vote in this order."
"In accordance with Rule 121(1)(2) of the Rules of Procedure, only the votes in favour will be counted, i.e. the votes made with the left hand button."
"I ask the election officers to come to the rostrum to oversee the vote."
"Mr President, If I understood you correctly when you were talking about the electronic voting, you said that we can only vote in favour."
"Surely in a democratic society you can at least abstain?"
"Mr Miller, thank you for your words."
"Obviously, all Members of the Parliament can use any of the three buttons they wish."
"What I meant was that we simply need a relative majority which means we shall only take account of votes cast for, since we do not need to take any account of the others."
"If I was misunderstood I am very pleased to make things clearer: you can vote with any of the three buttons you like."
"Only the votes 'for' will be counted and may I remind you all that all we are doing is establishing an order of vote."
"I also remind you that if the political groups had been able to reach an agreement on that order it would not now be necessary for us to vote, since there are no more candidates than the existing number of posts. In other words, everyone..."
"Is it possible for one of the candidates to have more votes against than votes in favour?"
"For in that case he or she would, of course, not be elected, because more votes against than votes in favour do not constitute a relative majority."
"Mr Wolf, please take a closer look at the Rules of Procedure."
"All we are doing is establishing an order of precedence among the candidates."
"However, the number of relative votes is completely irrelevant."
"If we had a secret ballot and one candidate had three votes, another had two and the third one vote, they would still be elected."
"The aim of this vote is simply and exclusively to determine the order of precedence."
"Of course, if any of you oppose this, perhaps you would have the courage to get up and say 'I oppose this' , which means that we would automatically hold a vote by secret ballot."
"But since no-one has opposed this, I am now going to stop wasting the Assembly's time and call for an electronic vote."
"Mr President, this is not the first time this has happened, but it seems to suggest a rather curious practice that we have adopted."
"What it would seem to me you are suggesting is that as long as all the candidates can get one vote, which means they can vote for themselves, they are bound to be elected."
"Of course they have been put forward by political groups, but surely it cannot be an acceptable situation that somebody can be elected vice-president when a majority of people in Parliament do not wish them to be elected."
"Although I doubt we can do anything more now - and I am sure you are strictly following the Rules - I think that we need to look at this practice again for the future."
"I shall be very pleased, Mr Elliott, to consult the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and put to them the proposal that you have made about whether the system should be changed."
"Mr President, I cannot recall any time in the past twelve-and-a-half years that I have been here that we have used this method for sorting out this particular problem."
"I cannot recall it."
"That is the first point I would like to make."
"The second point I would like to make is this: on the last occasion this occurred, which was the last time we voted in this Chamber for the election of President and Vice-Presidents, we had to go for an exhaustive ballot."
"Therefore I see no reason why we should not go for an exhaustive ballot on this occasion. Consequently, I object to the very principle that you are proposing to the House."
"Mr President, I think that under Rule 13 the ballot you just held is not admissible because you influenced the vote."
"If we hold a third ballot, we can do so electronically, as we decided."
"That is correct."
"That is what we decided."
"But in the meantime you keep announcing the results of the ballots."
"That means that after the results of the first ballot you indirectly influenced the second one."
"In a secret ballot - which is what the first and also the second ballots were - all the candidates are elected at the same time and then you announce the results at the end."
"So this was not a secret ballot, even if it was electronic."
"I think this is a kind of manipulation we cannot accept!"
"(Applause, mixed reactions)"
"Mr Telk√§mper, your remark will be taken into account and conveyed to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"I never claimed to have the last word."
"I have tried to facilitate the expression of this Assembly's will in terms of the order of precedence of the three Vice-Presidents but of course the President's interpretation can always be reviewed by the Committee on Rules of Procedure and so that decision will be conveyed in due time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I disagree entirely with Mr Telk√§mper's observation that you tried to 'manipulate' the vote."
"That is not correct. The vote was taken by secret ballot."
"Of course, this is an unprecedented experience and it would be good in such cases if the results were announced at the end. But the vote was of course taken in secret, and there was no ill intent on your part."
"Mr President, I believe you are quite right to refer a number of matters arising in connection with this vote to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"I should like to add another to that number. There is evidence that the election procedure, both for the President and for the Vice-Presidents, is not sufficiently democratic."
"The voting papers used for your own election, Mr President, the election of the President of this Parliament, were not the same as those used for the election of the Vice-Presidents."
"I ask you to conduct an inquiry to find an explanation for the existence of these different voting papers and the way in which they were distributed, and to refer this matter also to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you are talking about two different things."
"On one hand, you are referring to what has been said by the presidency and I am not going to insist on that."
"Secondly if there were different types of ballot papers I should ask you if you would provide the administration with data and the necessary proof since this is a very serious accusation which has to be backed up with very concrete proof."
"If you can do so then an investigation will be held."
"Election of Quaestors"
"The next item is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament."
"The following nominations have been received:"
"Mr Balfe Mr Bardong Mr Killilea Mr Paasio Mr Ribeiro Mr Viola"
"The candidates have told me that they have agreed to stand."
"Since the number of candidates exceeds the number of posts to be filled, there will be a secret ballot."
"I remind Members that according to Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure the number of Quaestors shall be five."
"The members of the European Parliament have a maximum of five votes."
"Any ballot papers containing more than five votes will be declared null."
"The election officers will be the same as for the previous elections, and I ask them to stand by the ballot boxes."
"(The vote took place)"
"Address by the President"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sittings of Friday, 13 December 1996, Monday, 13 January and Tuesday, 14 January 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, in the Minutes of the sitting of 13 January, my name does not appear on the attendance register - no doubt through some error of my own."
"Thank you, Mr Colom i Naval."
"That will be corrected."
"Mr President, the Minutes of 13 January state that I have been appointed as a Member of the European Parliament."
"In fact, I was elected ."
"In the United Kingdom, even when a vacancy occurs mid-term in the European Parliament, we do not take the next Member on a party list; we have a by-election."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Corbett."
"I am sure that your remark will be taken into account by the Intergovernmental Conference, if it decides to address the issue - which affects us so profoundly - of establishing a uniform electoral procedure."
"Mr President, on page 9 of the Minutes it says that Mr Falconer said that an election had never been held."
"It should read 'these elections' because I was referring to the Vice-Presidential elections."
"Secondly, the Minutes do not record that I objected to the procedure, as you requested, and you then ignored that objection."
"Thank you, Mr Falconer."
"That will be noted."
"The only thing that I would say is that you did not express your objection when I asked if there were any objections - although I did notice your protest later."
"Mr President, the Minutes of Monday do not include my name in the attendance register, but I was present."
"That has been noted, Mr Herman."
"Incidentally, I assume you also voted, so that should appear in the Minutes too."
"Mr President, can I remind you that in December a Member of this House was seen to have - and indeed admitted to this House that he had - voted twice in one of the votes, using the card of another Member of this House."
"You will know that, after discussion in this House, that issue, which is a serious breach of conduct, was referred to the Bureau of Parliament."
"I ask you, please, to report on what the Bureau of this Parliament decided to do about that gross breach of conduct in this House."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"This decision of the Bureau raises several issues."
"Firstly, it seems to me, in the light of the Bureau's interpretation of these actions, that it is clear that the President in the Chair at the time acted incorrectly in interpreting the Rules, because what should have happened for a gross breach of conduct was that the Member should have been excluded from the House at that moment."
"As a result of referring it back to the Bureau, and the Bureau then saying that it cannot act retroactively, it is clear that exclusion is impossible because of an incorrect interpretation by the President in the Chair at the time."
"That is very much to be regretted and, from my group's point of view, no matter where in this House a Member who cheats in this way sits - whether it be on the left or on the right - in future my group will be asking for immediate exclusion of that Member at the time that the incident occurs."
"Nothing else will satisfy us."
"Secondly, I would ask you to confirm that the letter was sent to the Member concerned and to read to this House that letter so that everyone is aware of exactly what has been said on behalf of this Parliament to a Member who engaged in a breach of conduct in this House."
"Mr President, I would stress that the Bureau of Parliament is obviously competent in this matter."
"At the instigation of Mrs Green, you have announced the Bureau's conclusions."
"Moreover, you have informed the House of the content of the letter sent to Mr Pasty."
"I think that reading out that letter, in other words the two paragraphs which we have heard, means that the reprimanding of the Member in question has been made public, which is of course in itself a form of disciplinary action."
"Mr President, we all know that interpreting the Rules of Procedure is always an issue that stimulates great debate."
"That often happens in the Bureau as well. We had a very prolonged discussion on this subject."
"I cannot accept Mrs Pauline Green's comment. She knows how much I esteem her, but in this instance I disagree with her."
"I think an elementary regard for the truth demands that we must acknowledge that Mrs Nicole Fontaine did not misinterpret the Rules of Procedure."
"The Rules gave her the option to impose the penalty of exclusion, leaving it to her discretion."
"The Rules of Procedure say that the President may ."
"He or she 'may' , Mrs Green, but it is not obligatory."
"The President on that day, during a very difficult sitting, when we were all very tired, and after discussion with the House, deemed that the matter should be referred back to the Bureau."
"I do not think she interpreted the Rules incorrectly, she was not obliged to exclude Mr Pasty and I do not think we ought to create the impression that Mrs Fontaine acted wrongly."
"She judged as she saw fit so that the day in question could end, and the issue then came to the Bureau and we considered it, Mrs Green."
"I cannot agree with you, you are mistaken there."
"Look at the Rules of Procedure, where it says may , but without obligation."
"From then on, if you look at the Rules again, you will see: we debated at length, Mr Kerr is at your side, and we reached our conclusions and the President wrote Mr Pasty the letter, because the time had passed for us to talk about applying the Rule on exclusion."
"This is a delicate and difficult matter which concerns the reputation of a Member of the House and that of this House as a whole."
"We shall hear the five Members who have asked to speak."
"Mrs Green has asked me for the floor again afterwards."
"Before giving it to her, I shall set out the presidency's interpretation of this matter."
"Mrs Malone, one thing should be made quite clear: once the result of a vote has been announced by the President, it cannot be modified."
"In this case, moreover, Parliament's services have established that the outcome of the vote would have been the same, whether or not this vote was incorrectly cast."
"The result would have changed by one vote, but the outcome would have been the same."
"I should therefore be grateful if Members would not persist with this issue."
"The decision was made, and no one questioned the validity of the vote at the time."
"Consequently, the result of the vote announced by Mrs Fontaine stands."
"Mr President, as regards the result of the vote, I should very much like you to announce the result to the House here once again."
"If my information is correct, this was a very controversial amendment which was adopted by just one vote, in other words that of Mrs Baldi, who was not in the Chamber. This means that if that vote had not been cast, the amendment would not have been adopted, because it would not have obtained a majority."
"That does of course make matters even worse."
"It was a very controversial amendment."
"I completely fail to understand why further sanctions have not been taken against Mr Pasty in order to prevent this kind of development in future."
"I should be grateful if you would announce the result of the vote here again, loud and clear, so that we all know if you are actually in the right."
"It was a roll-call vote, so that is possible."
"Mrs van Dijk, I would ask you to take account of what I have just said."
"I pointed out, firstly, that Parliament's services have established that the act in question did not affect the outcome of the vote."
"I also made it clear that, under Parliament's Rules of Procedure, once the result of a vote has been announced, it cannot be changed."
"I would also ask you to bear in mind the fact that no objections were made concerning this vote when the Minutes were submitted for approval on the following day."
"Mr President, I do not gladly intervene in this kind of discussion, but this is a serious matter where the reputation of Parliament is at stake."
"I was not present at the vote in question, so I do not wish to comment on what took place on the Thursday of the last part-session."
"I wish to comment on the Rules of Procedure."
"Neither Rule 117 nor Rule 110 makes any mention of the Bureau."
"So all the references in this discussion to the Bureau are not in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"The Rules only mention the President."
"My question is thus a direct one to you, Mr President."
"Rule 110 states that in cases such as this, the President may, after giving formal notice, move that Parliament pass a vote of censure against the Member concerned."
"Can I interpret your comments, Mr President, as meaning that you have just given formal notice to the Member concerned, pursuant to Rule 110, and that you have thereby taken your responsibility under the Rules?"
"I should be grateful for some clarification from you on this point."
"Before giving the floor to Mrs Fontaine, I shall answer the question which Mr de Vries put to me directly."
"I shall refer to Rule 110, since Rule 117 specifically states that any infringement of Rule 117 shall be dealt with in accordance with Rule 110."
"Rule 110 states that: ' In serious cases of disorder, the President may - may , in other words, it is left to the discretion of the President of the sitting - after giving formal notice, move, either immediately or no later than the next sitting - it has to be on the same day or the following day, therefore - that Parliament pass a vote of censure which shall automatically involve immediate exclusion from the Chamber and suspension for two to five days' ."
"It is clear, therefore, that the President of the sitting is required to exercise his or her powers in accordance with the seriousness of the incident."
"I recall - since I was present at the sitting in question - that someone in the Chamber expressed the view that the matter should be referred to the Rules Committee, but that no one called at the time for the exclusion of the Member concerned, and that it was thought to be sufficient to refer the matter to the Bureau."
"Perhaps the House did not remember that there is a deadline, but it is my understanding - and this is the prerogative of the President or the Rules Committee - that once those two days have passed, it is not possible, according to the Rules, to take the disciplinary action provided for by Rule 110."
"And my interpretation coincides with that which former President H√§nsch asked to be minuted."
"Our interpretations are therefore in agreement."
"Nevertheless, I give an undertaking that the Minutes of today's sitting will be sent to the Rules Committee, so that it can examine this interpretation, if it thinks fit."
"As things stand, however, both Mr H√§nsch and I take the view that Rule 110 establishes a clear deadline."
"Moreover, I would remind the House that, pursuant to Rule 110(2), ' Parliament shall decide whether to take such disciplinary action at a time to be decided by the President, which shall be either at the sitting during which the events in question occurred or at one of the three following sittings' ."
"Naturally, however, the disciplinary action has to be proposed on the same day or the following day."
"Consequently, neither the Bureau nor Mr H√§nsch, in application of their powers, was able to take disciplinary action in this case."
"I would repeat that, if the feeling is that this situation should be changed, it will be changed by the appropriate means, which is via the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"Hence the Bureau considered - and I have read out the minutes of its meeting - that Mr H√§nsch, in application of his powers to ensure order in the Chamber, was fully authorized to send a letter to the Member concerned."
"You are asking me to read out that letter."
"I would make the point that if I read out Mr H√§nsch's letter, then I must also read out Mr Pasty's reply, and for a very clear reason: anyone who is facing an accusation has the right to be heard, and naturally the Rules provide for such an opportunity for self-defence."
"In these circumstances, and in view of the fact that the Rules do not specify whether or not the letters should be read out, I shall leave that decision to the House."
"Mr President, I indicated clearly at the beginning that I wanted to speak."
"I want to make two important points."
"As far as Rule 110 is concerned, it is absolutely clear what the situation is."
"They are Rules that we have discussed over a long period of time and the question is really the interpretation of the Bureau as to what constitutes 'the next sitting' ."
"The next sitting is, in fact, today - the first occasion when we can deal with the matter."
"It is very clear in the Rules that Parliament decides."
"We all know that 'one person, one vote' is absolutely central to the work of this Parliament and I have to say to you, Mr President - and I hope you will listen very carefully - that you are the fifth president of the European Parliament that I have raised this issue with."
"For twelve years there has been a practice in this Parliament, which some people jokingly describe as 'playing the piano' ."
"This is the first time there has been an investigation carried out by the presidency which has identified a Member who eventually - reluctantly - admitted guilt."
"The other important point is that, at a great deal of public expense, this European Parliament sends representatives as international observers all over the world - to Africa and to Eastern Europe, for example."
"Only a week ago I, as the representative of the Socialist Group, Mr Stasi of the Group of the European People's Party and Mrs Andr√©-L√©onard of the Liberal Group, returned from the first multi-party legislative elections in Chad."
"Our main concern as observers was to make sure that there was no cheating and no one taking part in those elections voting more than once."
"Unless we are capable of implementing our own Rules, some of us in the European Parliament will call upon the international community, including the Joint Assembly of the Lom√© Convention, to investigate the democratic practices in this Chamber itself."
"Thank you, Mr McGowan."
"I now put to the House my proposal to read out the letters in question."
"(Parliament agreed to the proposal) I shall therefore read out the letters."
"Mr President, I am delighted you are going to read the letter."
"May I say that I believe that if you were to read an exchange of letters, that would be entirely inappropriate."
"We are asking you, as President of this House, to read a letter that was sent by the President of this House to a Member."
"If there is to be an exchange with you by that Member, that is something entirely different."
"We want to hear the letter the President sent as a result of an incident in this plenary."
"The Bureau can then deal with the consequences."
"Mr President, I have no intention of prolonging this debate, but having been in the chair at the time and had the very difficult task of dealing with this matter, I feel I owe Members a word or two of explanation."
"It was, I recall, during the last sitting of December, immediately before the Christmas recess, that this incident occurred."
"A number of Members asked for a check to be carried out, which I immediately did, with the results of which you know."
"As Mr Anastassopoulos has rightly said, the wording of Rule 110 is extremely clear. The President may exclude a Member."
"That is clearly stated, and I believe that the word 'may' and its equivalents in all the other languages mean the same."
"I felt, for reasons which may well be open to question, that no purpose would be served by excluding the Member concerned immediately."
"And, Mr de Vries, I would simply remind you that Rule 22(3) stipulates that 'the Bureau shall consider decisions relating to the conduct of sittings' ."
"That is why I felt I should act on the suggestion, made - if I remember rightly, and the Minutes will bear me out - by Mr Tomlinson, that the matter should be referred to the Bureau. This was a very sensible suggestion in such a difficult situation."
"I therefore asked that the matter be referred to the Bureau immediately."
"As is apparent, swift action was taken, because the meeting of the Bureau that immediately followed - the last chaired by Klaus H√§nsch as President - considered the matter, with the result you know."
"Let me immediately reassure Mrs van Dijk: we did of course take steps to determine whether the outcome of the vote in question, on Amendment No 13 to Mrs Zimmermann's report, would have been different."
"I am very happy to say that it would not."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say about this matter."
"Mr President, I should like to make it absolutely clear that I do not challenge the action or the decision made by Mrs Fontaine in the Chair."
"I may disagree with her interpretation but I do not challenge that she acted according to the Rules and I recognize Mr Anastassopoulos' heroic defence of his colleague in the Bureau."
"I have no challenge to Mrs Fontaine even though I may disagree with her interpretation."
"However, I am appalled at the letter from Mr Pasty which you read."
"Let us be clear that what happened in this House was seen by many Members of this House."
"It is not something which took place in a private room where there could be different interpretations of what happened."
"No one can vote in his own place and in someone else's and do it accidentally!"
"This is completely unacceptable, Mr President."
"There has been a clear breach of the Rules."
"If we had had from the Member concerned - whom, as you will have noticed, I did not name in my opening remarks - a clear apology to this House following the letter from President H√§nsch, we could have closed the incident."
"But I have to ask you now what you are doing as President of this House to deal with an attack on the presidency of this House by an individual Member seen to cheat in the voting in this House."
"Your integrity as President and our integrity as Members are at stake."
"Mrs Green, I proposed to the House - and the House approved my proposal - to read out Mr Pasty's letter as well, just as any letter of self-defence would be read out. And under no circumstances can this right to self-defence be restricted."
"However, the fact that I read out his letter does not mean that I accept or endorse what he said in his own defence."
"I have already made it quite clear what the Bureau's decisions were - which fully endorse former President H√§nsch's action - and I therefore have no need to reiterate what the Bureau said at the time."
"This is clearly a delicate matter."
"The fact that, instead of taking a decision, the President of the sitting preferred to refer the matter to the Bureau, has raised the question - and is raising the question again today - of which is the responsible body and what is the appropriate procedure for resolving such matters."
"The responsible body is the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"I shall therefore refer this matter to the Rules Committee, so that in the light of this case, for which there is no precedent, it can refine the relevant provisions of the Rules, if it considers that appropriate."
"For the present, nothing more can be done, and this matter is now closed."
"Mr Martens, I shall give you the floor, but I would ask you not to reopen this matter."
"I should like to make two very brief points."
"I was present in the Chamber at the time of the incident, and it is correct that Mr Tomlinson proposed that the matter be referred to the Bureau."
"Mrs Fontaine did that with the agreement of the House."
"Secondly, your decision to refer the matter now to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure is the right one, in my view."
"Thank you, Mr Martens."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, for the past half an hour I have been asking to speak on the Rules of Procedure, but you have repeatedly given the floor to Mrs Green, who has taken up half an hour by talking about her own affairs."
"Now I too wish to refer to the Rules, since I too am a Member of this House."
"Even those of us who sit on the right are entitled to speak!"
"Mrs Muscardini, this matter is closed."
"We are not going to reopen it with any more speeches."
"Mr President, I am referring to the official seated on your right, who perhaps has no eyes to see this area of the Chamber, but who has looked at me five or six times."
"I am asking to be allowed to speak in this House like everyone else. Otherwise we shall remain in the Chamber and not move from it!"
"Mrs Muscardini, I gave the floor to everyone who asked to speak the first time round."
"Mr President, I do not wish to speak on the discussion. I wish to speak on the Rules of Procedure, not the discussion!"
"Mrs Muscardini, the officials advise the President, who conducts the sitting in the way he thinks most appropriate."
"Of course, he may make mistakes, but he does try to move forward with the agenda."
"Election of Quaestors (continuation)"
"We now come to the results of the second ballot for the election of Quaestors:"
"Members voting: 449 Blank or void: 13 Votes cast: 436 Absolute majority: 219"
"The results are as follows:"
"Mr Bardong: 225 votes Mr Killilea: 182 votes Mr Paasio: 216 votes Mr Viola: 171 votes"
"Mr Bardong has thus obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast, and I congratulate him on his election."
"Two seats remain to be filled."
"It is therefore necessary to hold a third ballot."
"I would remind the House that, in the third ballot, a relative majority is sufficient for election to the seats that remain to be filled."
"The ballot papers and envelopes have been distributed."
"Since there are now only two seats to be filled, Members may not indicate more than two names."
"In the event of a tie, the eldest candidates will be declared elected."
"(The vote was taken) I would ask the tellers to go to Room 3 on the second floor to count the votes."
"Dublin European Council - Irish presidency - WTO Conference"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by the Council and the statement by the Commission on the meeting of the European Council of 1314 December 1996 in Dublin; -the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the six months of the Irish presidency, including the outcome of the Conference of the World Trade Organization in Singapore (9-13 December 1996).I give the floor to Mr Bruton, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate you on your election and also pay tribute to Mr H√§nsch for his excellent work when he held the office that you have now assumed."
"The Irish presidency of the European Union, which has just concluded, was characterized by very close cooperation with Parliament."
"There were about 40 separate meetings between Irish Ministers representing the presidency and various committees of Parliament."
"I think it is fair to say that the Irish presidency proved to be a success."
"If that is so, I believe it is so because we, in the presidency, listened closely to what Parliament was saying and tried to the best of our ability to translate the democratic mandate that you represent into concrete action at Council level."
"We also were very anxious to ensure during our presidency that the citizens of Europe could actually understand the work we were doing and would identify with it; that they would say to themselves: this means something to us."
"That is why, at the very outset of the presidency we took four phrases that would summarize in very understandable language what we were trying to do."
"These were: secure jobs in Europe, safer streets in Europe, sound money in the pockets and purses of Europeans and peace for Europe, between Europe and its neighbours, and amongst its neighbours."
"I am glad to say that we made progress during the six months on each of those four themes which are themes that everybody in Europe can understand as meaning something to them and their lives."
"My report to Parliament here today will refer back to those four themes."
"First of all, on the theme of sound money, it is fair to say that we made substantial progress at the Dublin Summit on the preparations for economic and monetary union."
"In particular, the agreement on the Stability and Growth Pact, the agreement on the new Exchange Rate Mechanism and on the legal status of the Euro, which were concluded at the end of the Irish presidency were a major step towards sound money in the pockets and purses of Europeans."
"I would particularly like to pay tribute to my colleague, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, of Luxembourg, for his contribution at the meeting in Dublin to what we achieved."
"On the question of safer streets in Europe, we were particularly successful."
"Here we were dealing with a problem which is very much in the minds of Europeans: the safety that they experience, or do not experience, when they leave their homes, or even within their homes, from organized crime."
"We all know that there is an increase in the level of violent crime."
"There is perhaps not an increase in the absolute level of reported offences, but we have seen an increasing degree of violence associated with such offences as are committed."
"A lot of this violent crime is associated with an increased traffic in illicit drugs."
"I am glad to say that during the Irish presidency we achieved substantial movement forward in making the streets, and indeed the rural areas, of Europe safer for our citizens."
"We agreed a resolution on serious illicit drug trafficking."
"We agreed a joint action on the approximation of laws and practices of police, customs services and administrative authorities in the fight against drug addiction and illegal drug trafficking."
"We agreed a five-year programme to assist people who are drug-dependent at the moment to reduce their dependency and to reduce the incidence of drug dependency, and we agreed a programme of closer cooperation between our customs authorities and business in the fight against drugs so that the border-free Europe that we have created will not be something that can be easily exploited by those engaged in crime."
"Furthermore, we took a very important decision in Dublin when we agreed to commission a major report on organized crime, which the Dutch presidency will receive in April this year."
"The other important objective is that of secure jobs for Europeans."
"In a real sense that represents the biggest challenge of all."
"If people are dependent on drugs and as a result of being dependent on drugs create a market for criminals, in many cases that is because they have no other way of making their life tolerable."
"They have no employment, no hope, no sense of dignity, no sense that their lives mean anything, and in an attempt to blot all that out, they turn to narcotics."
"If you look, for example, at the use of heroin in Dublin, the city I am most familiar with, there is a very close correlation between the level of long-term unemployment in a particular and closely identifiable geographical area, and the level of heroin abuse."
"Heroin abuse is confined to areas of long-term unemployment."
"Soft drugs - other drugs - are to be found everywhere, but heroin directly relates closely to longterm unemployment."
"That shows that there is a link between the problem of unemployment and many of the other problems we encounter as a society."
"We adopted the Dublin Declaration on Employment."
"That declaration recognizes that at the end of the day the primary responsibility for the creation of employment rests, in the first place, with national governments, but in practice, with the market economy."
"It rests with firms and individuals, either improving their own training capacity so that they become more employable or, if they are firms, expanding their markets so that they need more people working for them."
"It is an illusion to pretend that political institutions can solve the employment problem."
"They cannot, whether they be national institutions or European institutions."
"We should not raise expectations that bear no accord with reality."
"There is a risk with declarations about employment."
"We are engaged in a process of self-delusion if we believe that by adopting declarations or even spending large sums of money, we, as politicians, are going to solve the employment problem."
"We are not."
"We may improve the framework, we may improve the setting in which people will make the decisions that will create the jobs."
"But it is on the shoulders of people themselves that the big responsibility lies."
"In my view, the most important action we can take as far as employment is concerned is in the area of education and retraining."
"I believe that is the biggest challenge for the European Union."
"Education is an area where traditionally the European Union has stood back and regarded that as, firstly, a national responsibility."
"We have, on the other hand, been very involved in the area of training."
"But is there really a clear distinction in the modern world between training and education?"
"Is not all training educational and, in a sense, does not all education have a training dimension?"
"In a sense perhaps, if we are to talk in a profound way about making Europeans more employable, we have to talk about improving their skills, their education and their attitudes of mind."
"Increasingly in a modern world that is governed by information technology and advances in science it is not one's ability to do something that determines how employable one is. It is one's ability to think, to communicate, to arrange facts in a particular configuration and to process information."
"That is what determines one's employability."
"That capacity is not something that you train people to have, it is something that you educate people to have - educating people, if you like, to find the strength that is already within them; educating them to realize that most of us only achieve 10 % of our potential and encouraging them to discover the remaining 90 %."
"That is the challenge of employment in Europe: encouraging Europeans to have more confidence in their own ability."
"That is the profound challenge as far as employment is concerned."
"While I share the disappointment in Parliament that we have not provided funds for the TENs, let us not pretend that it is the crucial issue as far as employment is concerned: it is not!"
"It is at the level of education and training that the problem of employment for Europeans - the employability of Europeans - into the 21st century will be determined."
"I wish to refer, finally, to the fourth priority I mentioned, which was a peaceful Europe and peace between Europe and its neighbours and around Europe."
"It is fair to say that during the Irish presidency Europe became more recognized as a player in the Middle East peace process, as a result of the first Dublin Summit."
"I am glad that, perhaps in part as a result of Europe's involvement, we have now at last reached the point where this morning an agreement on Hebron was initialled between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat."
"We have also seen a qualitative improvement in our relationship with the United States during the Irish presidency."
"The action taken by the President of the United States in regard to suspension of the operation of Title 3 of the Helms-Burton act can be directly traced to the success of the pre-Christmas Summit between the European Union and the United States."
"We are handing the presidency on to the Netherlands, one of the founding members of the European Union."
"I am very confident that it will do an excellent job - and it is already doing so."
"It is very important that we should do everything possible to ensure that the Treaty is concluded in Amsterdam."
"If it is not concluded in Amsterdam on time as planned, the whole process of enlargement will be postponed and all the strategic considerations flowing from it will be left unaddressed."
"Everybody is aware that the timing of elections in different countries has a bearing on decision-making."
"But if decisions have to be made - and they do have to be made - it is probably better to make them in a month than it is to take four months to make them."
"I do not believe that there is any great case for prolonging the agony."
"We know that some of the decisions on the table will be unpleasant for all of us - not the same ones for each country, of course."
"We might as well do the job in Amsterdam as postpone it, and I hope that is what happens."
"I wish to conclude my few remarks here by saying that Europe, as I see it, has been looking inward for the last three or four years: we have been looking inward at the project of a single currency, the project of a new Treaty, the project of the single internal market."
"Our thinking is very introspective - and necessarily so - because unless we get things in order internally we shall not be able to take external action."
"But I hope that the next phase of Europe's development will be more outward-looking once we have got this business out of the way."
"There are major philosophical, cultural and ethical challenges facing the world in respect of which Europe can, and should, be a major player."
"If I were to state the major challenge currently facing European politicians it is not the question of what instruments we find to deal with the problems of the single currency, or what the precise relationship is between Parliament and the Commission or between the Council and Parliament."
"Those sorts of issues are important to all of us here, but perhaps they are not very important to our citizens."
"What is important is: do our citizens understand the philosophical, ethical and cultural project in which we are engaged for the 21st century?"
"Do we understand the ethical issue that is posed for us by the huge increase in population in Africa, the problem of poor people surrounding this increasingly small island of privilege which is Europe?"
"Do we understand, and have we a means of coping with, the ethical questions that arise in regard to the way in which we are using up so much of the resources of the world?"
"If we do a demographic projection forward 50 years, we know we cannot continue doing so or allowing other countries to do so."
"There is, if you like, a demographic and an environmental time bomb which we need to defuse and we need to have a sense of understanding that enables us to do that."
"Through technology we have created a global market: money can now move within seconds from one part of the world to the other."
"But, as all of us know, markets are not based on rules alone, they are based on a shared ethic."
"Unless there is a shared cultural understanding of the basis of business, no business will be possible in the long term."
"Do we have a global ethic?"
"Do we understand the ethics of business on a world-wide scale, or is the global marketplace that we have created going to be an area empty of ethical principles where people simply exploit one another without any concern for the consequences?"
"Do we understand this, as we inevitably rush towards ever higher incomes for people who are at the very top of the scale in terms of their capacity to exploit this global marketplace?"
"Do we understand that this means that there are still a large number of people who are completely left behind?"
"Is it not the case that, in a sense, globalization is adding to income inequality in Europe?"
"And what is that doing to the solidarity that is so necessary for Europeans to feel a sense of identity, a sense of citizenship?"
"Has the underlying sense of what we are caught up with the global reality?"
"Each of us has a sense, if you scratch us hard enough, of what we are: Irish patriots, French patriots, British patriots, Scottish patriots or whatever."
"This form of self-definition, this cultural identity that we retain from pre-war years, is not actually adequate to the world we have created in the global marketplace."
"Once the IGC is out of the way and the single currency is established - no minor task I admit - the debate in Europe is going to move into an area of philosophy, culture and ethics."
"If it moves into that area the public will become much more interested in Europe than they are today."
"The gap between citizens and the Institutions will be narrowed, because then we will be talking about things that people themselves worry about and we will be defining Europe in terms that directly affect the sort of philosophical sense that people have of the relevance of their own lives."
"That is the challenge for Europe in the years ahead."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you for your statement, Mr Bruton, and for your kind opening words to the Chair."
"I now give the floor to Mr Santer, on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, summarizing the achievements of the Irish presidency is an agreeable task."
"Once again, a small country has shown that it can provide a great presidency. The Irish presidency has taken the initiative in many areas; it has adopted carefully thought-out objectives."
"I cannot cover them all, the more so since I believe that the end product of these efforts is well reflected in the agenda of the Dublin Council, which made this a major event."
"A month later, we must judge it by the yardstick of our great objectives for the European Union."
"Has it taken us further down the road towards closer and closer union between the nations of Europe?"
"Has it helped to bring the Union closer to its citizens?"
"And has it laid the foundations of the Community's future on the threshold of its enlargement?"
"To all these questions, my answer is yes - but I must immediately add that Europe needs more."
"We must push on, persevere unceasingly."
"That applies to the single currency, it applies to employment, it applies to cooperation on internal and judicial affairs."
"And it applies to the Intergovernmental Conference, which is now moving into the finishing straight."
"Mr President, I have always said that the single currency would happen, and that it would happen on time."
"And the Dublin Council has removed some more of the obstacles from the road ahead."
"The message is a very positive one: the two Regulations on the legal status of the euro have been approved in principle and can now be finalized, the first being due to come into force this year and the second by 1998, when the Council has ruled on which Member States will be participating in the euro zone."
"The European Council has approved the new exchange mechanism, designed to safeguard the unity of the single market between the countries which join the single currency from 1 January 1999 and those which do not - the ins, the pre-ins and the outs."
"The agreement reached on the growth and stability pact, especially, has blown away the last few clouds and made the prospects for monetary union even brighter."
"We were able to agree on the necessary compromise - a good compromise."
"Budgetary policies are now provided with a suitable framework, proof that the political will remains firm."
"That will is in line with the internal budgetary efforts that the States are making, and here again I repeat the conviction I have had from the outset: growth is returning, and, provided that the Member States do not relax their efforts, there will be a large number of countries participating in the euro zone from 1 January 1999."
"The agreement on the growth stability pact, then, is the strongest signal this Council has given us in monetary matters, a stimulus to optimism."
"It is a signal, too, that has been received by all the economic and financial actors in Europe and elsewhere."
"Everyone now knows that the euro will be a fact of life from 1 January 1999."
"Indeed, by a happy coincidence, the designs for the future euro banknotes were presented at this same Council, giving a recognizable face to Europe's currency, and demonstrating the very tangible nature of this project of ours, which concerns every European and is a tool in the struggle for jobs."
"Let me state very clearly that, for me, the European currency is a means, not an end, one of the weapons with which we can fight the battle for employment."
"Mr President, we must leave no avenue unexplored in our efforts to increase employment."
"That is the real message of the pact of confidence for employment: nothing must be left undone that will promote employment."
"And I congratulate the Irish presidency on its unstinting efforts, to which the Dublin declaration on employment bears witness."
"Cooperation between the Commission and the presidency has been exemplary and fruitful, focusing on the objectives of the pact of confidence for employment."
"My specific purpose in concluding that pact was to mobilize all the European actors, at every level."
"There are strong signs that this concept is taking concrete form, and those signs are a powerful incentive to further progress, above all as far as the Member States are concerned."
"It is up to them to carry out the reforms."
"If they also combine forces and coordinate their efforts, there will be a multiplier effect at European level."
"In accordance with the Essen conclusions, the Council has adopted the second joint report on employment - another step towards joint mobilization, as indeed is the decision to set up the Committee on Employment and the Job Market, which is to play an important part in assisting the Council to prepare and implement the European employment strategy."
"We must move forward together towards the modernization of our economies."
"And instead of cultivating gloom, let us put the spotlight on those who get things done, those who get moving!"
"Out there on the ground, people are taking action, and that is why the territorial pacts were so well received in Europe's regions."
"The European Council decided to launch and finance some sixty such pacts."
"The social partners are moving, too, and, for the first time in the history of the Community, unions and employers have presented a joint declaration at a European Council meeting."
"They are currently negotiating at European level on work organization and flexibility."
"The single market is also among the priorities of the pact of confidence for employment."
"I am not going to summarize the progress made under the Irish presidency."
"We need not only to perfect the internal market, the single market, but also to exploit its full potential."
"There are substantial untapped reserves of growth and employment: I have therefore undertaken to present to the European Council in Amsterdam in June a plan of action and a detailed timetable for achieving this objective before 1 January 1999."
"My intention is to restore the dynamism of the single market with specific, priority proposals designed to make good all the existing shortcomings."
"We must also ensure that all the criteria for the proper functioning of this market have been satisfied."
"If its full potential is to be exploited it will be necessary, for example, to make sure that undertakings are fully informed of the new opportunities arising."
"The presidency has secured the adoption of the third multiannual programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I welcome that, because the SMEs have a critical role in employment: they must be made aware that the single market is their theatre of operations, too, not just the preserve of big business."
"Mr President, if there is one area in which the Irish presidency has made an exemplary contribution, that area is justice and internal affairs."
"If the fight against drugs is a public priority, it was an Irish priority too, and Dublin has shown that it was a European priority."
"Four programmes have been adopted that are designed to strengthen cooperation in the area of justice and internal affairs: GROTIUS, SHERLOCK, VOISIN and STOP."
"If it proves possible for these programmes to be launched during the present year, the credit for that must go to Ireland."
"The same applies to advances in the fight against organized crime, which, as we know, recognizes no frontiers."
"Our Member States must have a sense of solidarity, and show it."
"The Council has decided to set up a high-level group responsible for drawing up a plan of action to a tight timetable."
"I am aware of a growing sense of optimism in this respect."
"That could be a good omen for the IGC, which is why this trend now needs to be reflected by positive action."
"I know you share my conviction: if we finally equip ourselves with the weapons to fight this war, Europeans will take notice."
"Now, Mr President, I come to the matters that will determine the institutional future of the European Union."
"At the end of six months' intensive work, the presidency's text has enabled us to see these matters more clearly."
"We must pay tribute to the Irish presidency for selecting and applying the best possible method over these past six months."
"I have also been impressed by the commitment to the Intergovernmental Conference of Parliament's representatives, Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok, and I am very pleased, incidentally, that the European Parliament and the Commission see eye to eye on many points."
"But we must not deceive ourselves: we are still a long way from achieving texts that clearly respond to the concerns of the public and the problems of enlargement."
"That will be the role of the Dutch presidency, and we shall be discussing it this afternoon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you also wanted an opportunity to discuss the results of the Ministerial Conference in Singapore."
"Overall, they are positive."
"The European Union was able to obtain reaffirmation of the commitments entered into during the Uruguay Round, as we hoped, but those commitments have not been extended, which was the particular aim of those countries that export textile products and agricultural produce."
"The Singapore declaration on multilateralism and non-discrimination in the services sector is encouraging, as are the agreement on information technology products and the political commitment to telecommunications."
"I must not pass over the passage in the ministerial declaration which refers to the initiative on behalf of the less developed countries, because it was the Commission's efforts in Singapore that ensured that the initiative was not simply buried."
"It is true that neither the question of relations between trade and environment nor that of basic social standards saw the breakthrough for which the Commission was hoping."
"I remain convinced that the future will enable us to press forward with our ideas, as indeed we can do here and now in the other two areas in which the Union is keenly interested: relations between trade and investment, and relations between trade and national competition rules."
"Mr President, we often - too often - hear it said that Europeans distrust Europe."
"I do not go along with this view - I am profoundly convinced that Europeans are still favourable to Europe."
"Although it is true that their attitude today is a cautious one, that is because Europe has been presented to them too ideologically over the years."
"That is not my approach: let's stick to the hard facts, and prove that the Union is working for the benefit of Europeans - then we shall regain their support!"
"That is my political line, the same line as has been adopted by Ireland: the results are there to be seen!"
"The Dutch presidency will follow the same road, and we shall be discussing that this afternoon."
"Europe has everything to gain from it!"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to welcome the Prime Minister of Ireland, John Bruton, to this House today and take the opportunity of both thanking and congratulating him on the excellent work of the Irish Government during the six months it held the presidency of the European Union."
"Ireland took over the presidency at a crucial time when the intergovernmental process was in the doldrums, when a concerted effort was needed to try to re-establish its momentum."
"Whilst my group may have very many criticisms of the draft treaty which came out of the Dublin II summit - and many of these will be aired by my group's specialists later in this debate - there is little doubt that the Irish commitment to and success in producing a draft Treaty covering many of the vital areas under consideration was a very considerable feat, especially given the very real differences which exist between the Member States of the Union on sensitive issues such as: flexibility and qualified majority voting; employment and the social dimension: the third pillar and the fight against drugs; international crime and terrorism; the development of a common foreign and security policy; and enlargement of the Union and much, much more."
"Ireland also took over the presidency at a time when the timetable for economic and monetary union demanded action, a time when the concept of EMU was under attack in many Member States and when it would have been simpler and much more comfortable simply to ease off the throttle and wait for the following presidencies to take up the challenge."
"I want to pay tribute to Ruairi Quinn who has been the President-in-Office of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers under the Irish presidency and who was determined not to take the easy option but rather to succeed with his agenda, to reach agreement on the stability pact, to finalize the legal arrangements for the Euro and the structure of the new EMS, all of this at a time when the Irish presidency was engaged with a heavy timetable of Council meetings, with the vexed questions of the budget of the Union for 1997 and at the same time conducting an ambitious series of meetings with this Parliament."
"I pay tribute to the work of Mr Mitchell, who is here this morning, in that respect."
"The presidency also met with the committees and political groups in this Parliament, while of course governing Ireland and engaging in the tortuous process of seeking real peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland."
"Perhaps it is to Ireland and its buoyant economy, its expanding potential and its burgeoning confidence that we should look when we ask ourselves why one of the Union's smallest countries should have performed so well in the presidency of the Union."
"Unlike its big neighbour, Ireland's government - and when we listen to Mr Bruton this morning we understand why - understands the European perspective."
"It has engaged itself in the processes of the European Union, not just in a very practical sense but through an intellectual examination of Ireland's future prospects and place in the world."
"That was well demonstrated by Mr Bruton's comments."
"I want to turn my attention for a moment to the foreign policy agenda of the Union in the past six months."
"Ireland has exercised a measured and thoughtful role in this most difficult of areas as well."
"In this Parliament we have congratulated Foreign Minister Dick Spring for his intelligent and sensitive handling of Europe's role in the Middle East peace process."
"Once again in contrast to some of the Heads of State in the Union, the Irish presidency operated with a maturity that brought credit on the Union and we thank the Prime Minister for that as well."
"We on this side of the House believe that your presidency has been a success."
"That is not to say of course that we agree with every decision or every statement and Mr Bruton would not expect us to."
"Far from it, but we are able to see that the Irish presidency was conducted efficiently and effectively in staunch defence of European objectives and with integrity."
"It has laid the grounds for the Dutch presidency and demonstrated that Europe can play a role internationally."
"Such a role is crucial at this moment."
"The President-in-Office will recollect that the European Union played a facilitating role in the Middle East peace process at the Barcelona Conference which launched the Union's Mediterranean policy."
"As I am sure we all do, I welcome the signing of the Hebron Agreement today."
"Given the present tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the opportunity now exists for the Union to demonstrate its facilitating role again by using the arena of the Mediterranean Conference to bring together all those involved in the current tension - Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, all involved and committed to the Mediterranean process."
"Shortly the Foreign Ministers, including that of Ireland, will meet in the context of the Mediterranean Conference to discuss security issues."
"I urge them and I hope you will urge them, as the outgoing presidency but part of the Troika of the European Union, to exercise their considerable diplomatic and political leverage to diminish both tension and the desperately dangerous arms race which has now gathered pace in the Eastern Mediterranean."
"We should be pursuing the item which has been on the agenda for the last two years of demilitarization on the island of Cyprus with as much strength and vigour as they are now pursuing the arms race in the Eastern Mediterranean."
"In conclusion, the Irish presidency has laid a firm foundation for the succeeding presidencies on the IGC, on EMU and shown that sensitive diplomacy which recognizes what Europe can do and the role it can play in the present world is something we have to offer."
"We thank the presidency for that."
"Mr President, both the Dublin summit and the Irish presidency were a remarkable success."
"As the President of the Commission has just said, it has shown once again that the representatives of a small country can provide a great presidency of the European Council."
"That was certainly the case with Taoiseach John Bruton and his ministers, who have carried out their task efficiently and with a strong sense of conviction towards Europe."
"The European currency is now firmly on course - not only because the seven euro banknotes are to be brought into circulation in many countries from 2002, but also because a decision on the stability pact was taken in Dublin."
"For us, this stability pact is not a strait-jacket for our economies."
"On the contrary, we are convinced that it will bring interest rates down and promote economic growth and employment."
"It is therefore high time for us to persuade our fellow citizens of the fact that this economic and monetary union is the best weapon against the unemployment which is still so radically undermining our society, and I thus believe that the declaration on employment which you have extracted from the European Council, Mr President-in-Office, is a real breakthrough."
"I know something of the workings of the European Council, and you have achieved a real breakthrough which is a very great success."
"It was also decided in Dublin that the Finance Ministers would form a kind of joint economic administration in relation to the European Central Bank."
"They will have to determine Europe's external relations with other currency areas, in particular the dollar zone."
"With the single currency, Europe will be able to limit very substantially the monetary upheavals which are disrupting whole sectors of our economies."
"The Irish presidency also succeeded in taking the IGC negotiations into a political phase."
"When the IGC has been successfully concluded in Amsterdam, we shall have to make a start on enlargement."
"This is of crucial importance for the stability and security of our continent."
"The peoples of Central and Eastern Europe are nurturing high expectations."
"I have to say, however, that if the Amsterdam summit does not succeed in organizing the European Union in an efficient, effective and democratic way, it would not be justified to begin these negotiations on enlargement."
"That is why some very sensitive issues, such as the composition of the Commission, the powers of the European Parliament, the weighting of votes, majority decision-making in the Council and the competence of the Court of Justice will have to be resolved."
"European diplomacy must become a genuine instrument of cooperation and collective security."
"European defence policy must become a reality."
"Unfortunately, despite the successes of your presidency regarding external policy, I am bound to say that the positions adopted in Dublin on relations with Russia, for example, on the conflicts in the Great Lakes region and the situation in former Yugoslavia still fall short of a real common foreign and security policy."
"Because of the absence of political will and the lack of a common view of Europe's vital interests at world level, the conditions are still not in place for Europe to be shaped into a real power which can be a player of equal stature to the United States on the world stage."
"There will also have to be adjustments to the regional and agricultural policies and the financing of the Union."
"The adaptation of this financing is a necessity, so that some Member States are not given the impression that they are having to bear disproportionate costs in relation to enlargement."
"The remarkable progress - which is also being accepted in some national ministries - towards a real common police force, a kind of European FBI and a European legal area, augurs well for working together to combat terrorism, drug trafficking and international crime."
"Here too, we must pay tribute to the Irish presidency."
"Any initiative which is aimed at tackling justice and internal security issues jointly and subjecting these to democratic controls must be able to count on our support."
"A key factor for the coming months is that with your document, you have for the first time taken the negotiations into a political phase."
"I hope that the momentum will not be lost, and that the Dutch presidency will take the helm in the same spirit, though we shall be discussing that shortly."
"I congratulate both you and the Commission most sincerely on the outcome of the Dublin summit."
"Firstly, Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your election and wish you every success during your term of office."
"Cuirimse c√©ad mile f√°ilte roimh Taoiseach na h'Eireann agus Aire Gnothai na h'Eorpa ata anseo chun deire oifiguil a chuir le Uachtaranacht Eireann don Comhphobail."
"I warmly welcome the outgoing President-in-Office of the Council and his European Affairs Minister Gay Mitchell on their formal visit to the European Parliament to bring to a conclusion Ireland's presidency of the Union."
"We are all very pleased at the success of Ireland's presidency."
"To the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government and the many hundreds of civil servants who have been involved we say a very sincere thank you and we are very proud of you for a job well done."
"I am also pleased to say that the summit in Dublin was one of the more successful summit meetings in recent years."
"Solid progress was recorded on the four major priorities listed by the Irish presidency at the beginning of its term of office and approved by Parliament. which were the single currency, the fight against crime and drugs, the Intergovernmental Conference and the tackling of unemployment."
"The establishment of a single currency in less than two years' time is now firmly on course; the stability and growth pact ensures that the financial markets, investors and the general public can all be confident that the Euro will be a stable currency and will not be subject to fluctuations because of short-term policies being pursued by one or more governments within the new currency zone."
"I welcome the progress made in Dublin on strengthening cooperation between European Union countries in the fight against organized crime and international drug smuggling."
"The illegal drug trade is responsible for a great deal of misery in each of our countries and crime against people and property to fund drug habits means that large numbers of our citizens are living in constant fear for their personal safety."
"Those ultimately responsible for supplying the illegal drugs now available in communities throughout the Union have long operated on an international basis and effective action to curb their activities also demands a coordinated international response."
"The Union should allocate resources from its annual budget to intercept smugglers as the drugs are introduced to the Union, to control the distribution of substances used in the manufacture of drugs within the Union and to investigate the money-laundering activities of the drug barons."
"The draft revision of the Treaties which was presented to the Dublin Summit by the Intergovernmental Conference represents a solid basis from which to proceed to the final and most controversial stage of the negotiations on a new Treaty."
"The agreement at the summit on the draft revision of the Treaties was a major breakthrough and a special word of thanks is owed to those involved, in particular the government representative Noel Dorr, for the leading role he played in this respect."
"One of the issues still to be decided in these negotiations concerns the number of European Commissioners to be appointed in the future."
"It is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the Commission in all Member States and in the eyes of each national electorate."
"In the long run this will only be possible if each country has a full seat in the College of Commissioners."
"A second institutional issue still to be decided concerns the future operation of the presidency of the Council of Ministers."
"It has been suggested that the small European countries lack the resources and the ability to undertake the onerous task of presiding over the affairs of the Union and that the present system of rotating the six-month presidencies should be abolished."
"Well, the record of the Irish presidency during the last six months and in particular during the Dublin Summit, like the previous Irish presidency, demonstrates clearly that smaller Member States can organize efficient and successful presidencies and in many cases can broker agreements which larger Member States are unable to achieve during their presidencies."
"The experience of the last six months suggests that there is a strong case for preserving the present system of rotating the Council presidency."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would like to begin by congratulating you and also by congratulating the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government on the excellent conduct of Ireland's six-month presidency of the Union."
"It has been a period marked by a strong focus, hard work and considerable success."
"In the most effective and emphatic way possible, it has given the lie to those who argue that a rotating presidency among all Member States should no longer operate in future."
"You have established, Taoiseach, beyond doubt - and in Ireland's case, not for the first time - the capacity of smaller Member States to discharge their responsibilities to good effect, confounding many of those critics at Member State level who argue trenchantly for change."
"I would also like to pay tribute to Ireland's public service which, though relatively small in number, has managed to rise to the challenge of preparing and coping with the presidency and, in many instances, chairing many of the 2, 000 and more meetings that are part and parcel of the work of the presidency."
"Given the uncertainty that surrounded the issue prior to the Dublin II Summit, perhaps the single most significant political achievement was the agreement of the Stability Pact as part of the necessary preparations for economic and monetary union."
"As well as obtaining agreement on the legal status of the Euro and the general principles of ERM II, the Irish presidency has maintained and deepened the momentum towards a single currency."
"Here again, the capacity of smaller Member States to act as honest brokers, mediating between larger states, was well illustrated and underlined by the Irish presidency with the assistance, as has been acknowledged here today, of the Luxembourg Prime Minister."
"The Liberal Group, however, is disappointed with the sluggish and begrudging progress to date on a number of the liberalization dossiers, especially in telecommunications and postal services."
"This is not a direct failure of the presidency but rather a failure of the collective will of the Council itself."
"More disturbingly it is a failure to appreciate the competitive dynamics of a more open global economy - of which the Taoiseach spoke so eloquently - an issue which, if not addressed, would cost Europe jobs in the long-run rather than protect European jobs, as many of the proponents of the current status quo seem to believe."
"It is in the area of the intergovernmental conference that the Irish presidency has passed on its greatest legacy."
"The draft treaty is marked by both ambition and realism and is a credit to its main author, Mr Noel Dorr."
"However, at the institutional level and on the question of flexibility, we are disappointed that more progress has not been made."
"It would be unfortunate if, in the end, we were bounced into ill-thought-out or ill-conceived solutions without due reflection and debate because this will be crucial to our effective ability to cope with enlargement - a point, again, which the Taoiseach quite correctly emphasized as the next major challenge beyond the IGC."
"Mr President, although there is no Irish contingent in my group at present - but there is an associated party, which incidentally forms part of the Irish Government - I also wish to express my group's thanks for the work of the Irish team at the head of the Council presidency."
"Mr Bruton makes profound and brilliant speeches, and his Minister for European Affairs has conducted his relations with the European Parliament in an exemplary way."
"Having said that, I must also express my group's concern and disappointment at the outcome of the summit, although I appreciate that the incoming Dutch presidency will cast a more favourable light on the Irish presidency."
"And what is the reason for our concern and disappointment?"
"It is the weakness of the proposals concerning the institutional reforms aimed at democratizing the European institutions and improving their operation, above all with a view to enlargement."
"We certainly welcome the proposed new chapter on employment, but the draft treaty contains no reference to safeguarding public services or to the orchestration of job-creating policies."
"We regret the fact that no provision has been made for genuine progress on the issue of citizenship, and we have the impression that the most important decisions on the reforms will be taken at the last minute, without transparency and without directly informing either the citizens or those who represent them, so that they can discuss things in a responsible way."
"We do not agree with some of the statements which have been made concerning employment and the rehabilitation policies."
"We do not believe that the tough budgetary rehabilitation policies that are linked to the introduction of the euro automatically mean an increase in production and jobs."
"We disagree with that."
"We believe that they are leading to the growth of unemployment and a corresponding rise in financial speculation."
"It is essential for speculative financial transactions in Europe to be taxed."
"There are the new possibilities for employment in the environmental and social fields, but they are not enough."
"We feel that there is a need to reconsider the third stage of economic and monetary union, and to reflect again on the effects which are being produced in some national economies and societies."
"And we strongly disagree with the thrust of the pact on stability and growth."
"Indeed, the pact on stability and growth will impose conditions on the future budgetary policies of national governments and give rise to serious problems for some Member States."
"With regard to a citizens' Europe, we support the measures to combat drug trafficking - and the campaign against the laundering of profits from drug trafficking must be stepped up - but we regret the fact that the decision to create a European observatory for racism and xenophobia has not been taken."
"On external relations, we fully agree with the approach adopted to the Palestine question, but we regret the excessive tolerance and understanding shown towards the Turkish Government."
"The Turkish Government's record on respect for human rights does not justify it being treated in this way, since it is increasingly violating the human rights of its citizens and especially those of the Kurdish people."
"We should also like to see more decisive action to promote cooperation between the European Union and Cuba, with full reciprocal guarantees, and with a view to fostering democracy in that country."
"I do not have time to say more, Mr President-in-Office, but I wish to say that our criticisms are made in good faith, and that we hope that your excellent work bears fruit in the future at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I shall end by saying, without a trace of irony: may God help us in these difficult times, since we are unable to trust in Europe's institutions alone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the European Council in Dublin has finally got the single currency up and running, I shall confine my remarks to the work done at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As we said previously, in a resolution during December, the draft of the Treaty as revised by the Irish presidency - which I congratulate - has the great merit of providing a progress report on the IGC, which features a total deadlock in the field of institutional reforms and a complete absence of any will to move forward on the part of certain governments."
"My group believes that no one can afford the luxury of a wait-and-see policy, which involves the risk of last-minute bargaining, with uncertain and unpredictable results and, a fortiori, a threat not only to enlargement, which would be bad enough, but also to the future of the Union in general."
"We are convinced that Parliament must conceive a strategy, over and above its role of making suggestions, which it must of course continue."
"What should be the strategy of this House over the remaining six months, apart from the notable efforts of our two observers and the adoption of our resolutions?"
"A question which is all the more relevant in that the assent procedure does not apply to the results of the negotiations."
"I think it worth reminding the House that, on the occasion of the last enlargement, it undertook not to accept any further enlargements without sweeping institutional reforms."
"That means, among other things, a genuine procedure of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council, the abolition of the unanimous vote, the establishment of the Commission at the centre of the Union's institutional system and a tougher cooperation clause to prevent any future deadlock or paralysis."
"In conclusion, I should like to call formally upon President Santer to align the Commission with Parliament in this battle."
"The Commission is, de facto, the guardian of the Treaties."
"It would be incurring a serious responsibility if it were to fail to caution public opinion and the Member States against the dangers of any enlargement which is not preceded by a genuine institutional reform."
"Mr President, the European Council in Dublin once again highlighted the disagreement between those States for which the single currency is merely an instrument of economic regulation and those for which it is a central element of policy."
"In aligning themselves with the German arguments, which favour upgrading the workforce rather than a policy designed to give fresh impetus to global demand, some French leaders are committing a fateful strategic error and a major economic misjudgment."
"What benefit can there be for France, or for the United States or the United Kingdom, in bringing about the creation of a massive central European bloc under the control of a Germany which a traditional balance-of-power policy would make it easy to contain?"
"European integration has changed its nature. The utopia of Jean Monnet has given way to an area of widespread rivalries, a gigantic poker game in which the stake is European hegemony."
"A new strategy for an old objective!"
"Furthermore, the stability pact, to which the word 'growth' has been added for the sake of expediency, is tending to establish an economic model which is extraordinarily rigid and constricting for the Member States."
"Thus, not only would their monetary policy be imposed upon them - the same would apply to their budgetary, fiscal and social policies, in other words virtually all their policies."
"In the business world, assets only exist if they are profitable."
"General De Gaulle once said that policy in France was not just a matter of money."
"Those who claim that everything should be left to market forces are really burying their heads in the sand."
"In the face of this obvious truth, the participants in the Dublin talks have resigned themselves to soft growth and relocation, fully aware of the evil consequences that this policy of abandonment will have for employment and social cohesion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know that the criteria for the single currency will be nowhere near being satisfied in 1997 and that the real decision will not be taken until the French general election in 1998."
"At any time, whatever decision may be taken, the French people can be asked to give its opinion in a referendum on Europe."
"That is something you cannot change!"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Taoiseach, the T√°naiste, Mr De Rossa and also Minister Mitchell and Irish civil servants for clearly demonstrating once and for all that a small nation can not only shoulder the responsibility of hosting the EU presidency but can discharge its task with great success."
"During the last six months the Irish presidency accelerated the momentum towards a single currency; it identified an integrated European employment strategy covering macroeconomic policy and structural reform; it laid the basis for major initiatives in ensuring effective European cooperation against organized crime in general and drugtrafficking in particular and, equally importantly, it provided us with the remarkably simple and readable draft Treaty text identifying the alternative choices that we face."
"As we ponder these choices, the latest European buzzword has been thrown into the debate by the Commission and Member States - that of flexibility."
"Is this latest concept the ideal instant quick-fix to help us overcome our difficulties or is it a Trojan Horse designed to undermine the drive towards an ultimate federal Union?"
"I fear that it is the latter, especially if it offers a system which multiplies opt-outs and potential fragmentation rather than unity of purpose."
"The integrity of the Union requires all who believe in it to proceed together along the same road and in the same direction, as clearly set out by our founding fathers."
"This core integrity is more important than massaging the nationalist egos of recalcitrant Member States who have been, and will continue to be, a barrier to progress."
"It will not be an acceptable excuse that we halt the march to Union by sacrificing important principles in order to keep some or other blocking Member State on board."
"We should remember the experience of Maastricht."
"We weakened our commitment to the Social Charter and single currency in order to achieve a consensus."
"However, the price for compromising our position was not agreement, it was opt-out and a weakened text."
"For these reasons, I am wary of John Major's definition of flexibility earlier this week."
"It indicates that a majority of Member States might be allowed to proceed with closer integration, provided they have the consent of disagreeing Member States."
"That is not flexibility, that is a dictatorship of a minority over a majority."
"This central issue has to be faced sooner rather than later."
"The ultimate goal of Union sought by the overwhelming majority of Member States cannot be held to ransom indefinitely."
"Those who do not share our vision should be told once and for all that we do not intend creating structures for multiple opt-outs."
"Instead we will create structures where they can opt out totally if they so wish and allow the rest of us to pursue our shared vision of a united Europe unimpeded."
"I hope that the slogan of the Dutch presidency will become 'opt in or opt out' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, the Dublin summit will probably be remembered as an important step towards the achievement of economic and monetary union, a major political objective for Europe, on the planned date of 1 January 1999."
"So we must pay tribute, Mr President-in-Office, to the work done under your leadership during the past six months of the Irish presidency."
"Apart from the significant progress achieved in the monetary field, the Irish presidency - in line with its stated priorities - has succeeded in achieving a broad consensus on the approaches to be adopted in future with regard to employment policy, and on improving the future coordination of activities to combat the drug trade, organized crime, terrorism and the sexual exploitation of children."
"We must therefore congratulate the Irish presidency on its excellent results, and thank it for the efforts it has made to achieve those results."
"The conclusion of the stability and growth pact, which can be seen as a decisive step towards the introduction of the single currency, will no doubt be the most striking achievement of this summit in terms of its impact on the future of European integration."
"A Gallup poll conducted in four States of the European Union - Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy - clearly shows that our fellow citizens are in no doubt as to the magnitude of the issue at stake, whether they view it with enthusiasm or apprehension."
"And that issue is not purely technical or economic, but political in the strongest sense of the word."
"The introduction of the single currency, the euro, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, is an acid test we cannot evade."
"If the process is not completed, European integration will be no more than it is today - a single market and a customs union, but one that tends to merge more and more into a vast free trade area, open and exposed to all the currents of globalization."
"But if the process succeeds, then the European Union, strengthened by the new solidarity and disciplines created by monetary union, will become a true economic power on the international scene, and then, with the benefit of its reformed institutions, a political power too."
"We are talking not just about a development but about a real change in the process of European integration."
"If we want that change to be a success, we need the process of the reform of the European institutions to move forward in step with it. That process has now been prepared by the intergovernmental conference, but has not yet really begun."
"It will be up to the Dutch presidency to take over the baton and ensure that the Amsterdam summit is the counterpart, for the institutions, of what the Dublin summit has been for the currency."
"Mr President, I should like to add my congratulations to the Irish Government on the excellent way in which it has conducted the presidency."
"I shall devote my one minute to the institutional question."
"As it would appear from the final declaration from Dublin, this issue has in fact hardly been touched on, and that need not surprise us, because the Irish presidency has put forward few proposals on the subject, taking the view that the most important and most delicate institutional matters should be left to the final round of negotiations."
"This means that we may have many hopes, but also must have many fears, and that in any case we must be very vigilant."
"One point where vigilance is required is the danger that third pillar matters may be removed from the third pillar - not to the first, but to an institutional limbo where no individual parliament can then exercise controls."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome our Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, here and congratulate the Irish presidency, including our civil servants, on the hard work they have put in."
"I agree about the rotating presidency; it should continue."
"However, having said that, I do not agree with the outcome."
"I do not think anything the Irish presidency did halted efforts to make the European Union a military superpower or to stop the widening of the gap between rich and poor, which is the likely outcome of EMU. 'Adapting the European Union for the Benefit of its Peoples' is the title given to the document outlining the draft changes of the Treaty."
"This is totally misleading."
"Some changes to the security section of the document propose greater militarization of the European Union."
"The only people who would benefit from this would be the arms manufacturers."
"It is a tragedy that the Irish Government failed, and in fact, did not even try, to have adequate safeguards included in the draft changes to protect Irish neutrality and did not propose that the objective of disarmament be written into the Treaty."
"In fact, the draft changes would deepen the European Union's relationship with the nuclear armed Western European Union and pave the way for the eventual merger between the two bodies."
"The Stability Pact for the EMU, brokered in Dublin, is not something to be joyful about, although furthering the battle against unemployment was a stated objective of the Irish presidency."
"It played second fiddle to the rush to get agreement on the Euro."
"Mr Quinn, the Finance Minister, has described EMU as fundamentally a political project, but he has failed to identify any political benefits which will come from it, or allay fears that it will simply widen the gap between rich and poor."
"I also believe it will be an act of folly for Ireland to join EMU if Britain remains outside, as appears increasingly likely."
"Less than one-third of Ireland's trade is with the probable founding countries of EMU, while 70 % of it is with Britain and the rest of the world."
"Mr President, I also want to say hello to the Taoiseach and thank him for his marvellous, spontaneous remarks here today."
"I think congratulations have already been extended."
"You can see, Taoiseach, the respect Members here have for what you and your colleagues have done during the Irish presidency."
"It must certainly be a source of great encouragement to you."
"I am very proud of what you have achieved and you should rightly be proud of a job very well done."
"I think this summit will be judged a resounding success at many levels."
"I will just single out three different areas."
"Firstly, the Irish presidency was entrusted with the task of producing a draft treaty to replace Maastricht."
"Not only did you do this on time, as promised, but you also came forward with a 140-page document which, unlike the present Treaty, can be easily read by ordinary citizens and, most importantly, they can make sense of it on that first reading."
"Secondly, the draft shows that progress has been made at the IGC on a number of key institutional questions."
"Foremost amongst these is the recognition of the need to further democratize decision-making."
"I particularly welcome the commitment to streamline the codecision procedure, thus putting both sides of the European Union legislature, the Council of Ministers representing the Member States and us, in the European Parliament, representing the people, on a truly equal footing."
"I also welcome the commitment to extend the scope of codecision."
"I acknowledge, however, that these are merely commitments in principle."
"They will have to be fleshed out."
"I hope that the ambition shown by the Irish presidency, culminating in the draft treaty, can now be fulfilled in time for the Amsterdam Summit."
"The second main area of success was undoubtedly EMU."
"Many speakers have alluded to this."
"Progress was made on the new European monetary system, the legal status of the Euro, and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Had these decisions been fudged, the entire EMU project would have been undermined."
"It is vital that these successes are now accompanied by further measures which strengthen democratic control, protect the rights of consumers and fully inform ordinary people about the changeover to the single currency so that the prophets of doom will not be proved right."
"If the EMU is to win public confidence, this must be done."
"The explanation must be available, it must be clear and it must be transmitted by a willing media."
"Finally, I welcome the Dublin Declaration on Employment."
"This declaration is one of the most significant signs that I have seen, as a Parliamentarian, that our demands can influence the direction of the European Council."
"Mr Santer will tell you that time after time after time, we talk here about employment."
"Now we see action in the form of this Dublin Declaration on Employment."
"The declaration must now be followed up by real action as set out in specific instruments, realistic targets and effective timetables."
"The European Union must aim for greater coordination of employment policies and a growthorientated macro-economic policy."
"The Dutch presidency must follow on with specific measures on improving education, more relevant training, Community-based employment initiatives and giving priority to youth unemployment and life-long learning."
"Taoiseach, you have mentioned the importance of training and education and the connection with drug-taking in cities such as Dublin."
"I appreciate that you actually understand the demands and needs of the ordinary people."
"Again, I congratulate you and wish you well."
"I am glad to see that the Irish media are here in force this month."
"I hope that they will report back so that the Irish public will be informed of the high esteem in which our leadership is held."
"Mr President, there are a number of key issues on the basis of which one can assess Dublin and the Dublin document, and the first of these is openness."
"What have we achieved on this? We have Article 189b on codecision based on common rules, but no real progress."
"With regard to bringing the Union closer to its citizens, there is a statement on extending the acquis communautaire ."
"Not one decision is being given back to the Member States, something which Mr Santer has repeatedly said would be desirable, however."
"On democracy, there is to be codecision in a number of areas which we do not yet know about, but less parliamentary democracy overall, because more powers are being given to the EU."
"On employment, incentive measures are to be implemented, but there are no jobs to replace those being lost in the adjustment to the third stage of economic and monetary union."
"On enlargement, it can presumably be expected that a few wealthy Central and Eastern European countries or the richest among them will be able to join in 2005, but there is no mention of speeding up enlargement to include them all."
"And on the environment, there are some fine words, but no real changes are being made, except that the procedure established by the Court of Justice - which ruled that the environmental guarantee was unlawful and turned it into a derogation, whereby the Commission had to approve any divergences in the Member States - is now actually being confirmed."
"So that is a real step backwards."
"As regards the six key areas, or six key issues, identified by Denmark, one has to say that no progress is being made."
"On the contrary, we are getting everything we do not want: Union citizenship, police, armed forces, a single currency and resources for a federal state, and it will hardly surprise you, Mr President, that I am unable to support that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are three points I should like to raise in connection with this morning's debate."
"I don't see that the Irish presidency has all that much to be complacent about."
"Its muchvaunted monetary policy is costing us extremely dear, and the pact for employment is in conflict with market forces in the context of the shackles imposed by monetary union."
"The real problem, the problem of the undervaluation of the dollar, has never been addressed."
"We also hear much about successes on the law and order front."
"Well, I can tell you that in 1950 France recorded 250, 000 crimes and offences within her territory."
"In 1995, that figure had risen to 4.5 million."
"That trend is the same in most European countries, and no significant decrease has been recorded this year."
"The President-in-Office said a little while ago that the need to make life tolerable might explain a degree of delinquency, and especially the urge to take drugs."
"But, in this area, I believe that what makes life hard to tolerate is this civilization of enlightenment, cold, hard enlightenment that disregards the needs of human warmth, needs that are satisfied by a sense of family, by religious faith and by the greatly underrated sentiment of patriotism."
"Mr President, the presidency of these last six months, of which Dublin II was the summit in both senses of the word, has been the presidency of a small country."
"As a Luxemburger I welcome the success of the Irish presidency, which proves, if proof were needed, that political commitment to Europe is not dependent on a country's size or the size of its population."
"In passing, may I say that I also welcome Mr Bruton's recognition of the part played by the Prime Minister of Luxembourg in the Dublin compromise on monetary union."
"Ireland's success should convince us that the rotating presidency system remains a valuable one."
"It gives each Member State, large or small, the chance to show its commitment to Europe and its effectiveness, whatever the size of its government."
"And I believe there is a lesson to be learned here for the purposes of the institutional discussion at the intergovernmental conference."
"Mr President, the process of European integration is slow, and calls for patience."
"We must not be tempted to create the illusion of a great leap forward."
"The Dublin summit, for example, resolved nothing as far as employment is concerned."
"President Santer's pact of confidence for employment, greeted so enthusiastically by this House, did not receive the necessary political boost - nor, as Mr Bruton said, did the plans for the Trans-European Networks."
"We, as socialists, remain convinced that employment is the central duty of Europe."
"It is of course, as Mr Bruton said, a philosophical question, a philosophical choice."
"Europe will be saved not by profit but by investment, by training, and I agree with what the Irish Prime Minister said about the importance of that subject."
"Europe will be saved, too, by ecological and social standards."
"Our citizens do not understand that capitalism, to use that big word, may have been 'civilized' in the twentieth century in a national context but that it cannot be in a European context."
"Mr President, employment, social standards, economic and social cohesion - we as socialists see these things as forming an indissoluble whole."
"A final word, Mr President."
"I should like to pay particular tribute to the efforts of the Irish presidency in the field of internal security."
"We, as socialists, want to see much of what we call the third pillar entering the Community domain, and we shall support the efforts made to that end by the future Dutch and Luxemburgish presidencies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the Irish presidency."
"The Taoiseach himself invested a great deal of interest and initiative in the success of the presidency, but in a personal capacity I should also like to say how much I appreciated the good cooperation of Gay Mitchell and Noel Dorr, who made important contributions on employment and the Intergovernmental Conference from the European Parliament's point of view."
"The Irish presidency has smoothed the way for the last six months of the negotiations surrounding the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The agreement that was reached on the outstanding problems in connection with monetary union has freed us to focus our attention on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Monetary union is the final cornerstone of economic integration."
"The next step must be a move towards greater political integration."
"I believe that this monetary union will help to make Europe more competitive, and will contribute to an increase in stability and the creation of more jobs, and I do not share the view of Mr de Gaulle that monetary union will make one country dominant: on the contrary, monetary union will produce a sensible sharing of responsibility between the Member States of the European Union and will not make any country dominant."
"From Parliament's point of view, the Irish presidency has taken an important step in the paper which it has drawn up for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In fact, it has proposed a Treaty text that would make codecision the standard procedure for approving legislation."
"We should like to think that this will be the basis of the negotiating approach under the Dutch presidency, in terms of content and method."
"The document also proposes an extension of qualified majority voting, which we need if we are to develop the Union's capacity for action and prepare it for enlargement."
"The letter from Germany and France contains a proposal that this should, in fact, become the norm, from which there would be certain specified exceptions - in other words, the procedure would be reversed."
"If we could combine these two concepts, we would achieve the breakthrough on institutional reform that we so urgently need."
"I have no time to mention many other issues, and in particular the progress which was made on prioritizing thirdpillar policies in the area of foreign affairs and security."
"Let me mention briefly two further points in the time I have left."
"We must take care to see that we do not reach a situation in which the role of parliaments is downgraded - and the European Parliament is in the same boat as national parliaments in this respect - nor must we allow the creation of a new third chamber."
"Above all, we should like to point out that there can be no talk of the success of the Intergovernmental Conference until the European Parliament has full budgetary powers."
"That will be a key point for us when it comes to evaluating the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, the six months of the Irish presidency have been a period of intensive and productive effort."
"The Dublin European Council last month set a positive seal on the four main priorities announced by the presidency at the start of its term of office. Our group welcomes this and would like to remind the House of these priorities."
"They include the following points: the adoption of an important series of measures in the area of justice and home affairs; the progress made in respect of economic and monetary union, for example the approval of the structure of the new exchange rate mechanism; the agreement on the rules establishing the legal framework for the euro; the approval of the principles and main features of the growth and stability pact designed to ensure budgetary rigour in the economic and monetary union; the important results concerning the growth and employment strategy, which led to the adoption of a declaration on employment, in other words a common programme to identify a broad range of measures to be implemented at national and Community level, to strengthen the synergy between the macro-economic and structural policies in the Member States' programmes for employment and growth; and the presentation, as requested by the Florence European Council, of a general outline document for a draft revision of the Treaties, focusing on three main objectives - bringing the Union closer to its citizens, strengthening and broadening the common foreign and security policy, with the aim of achieving greater consistency and efficiency, and ensuring, with an eye to enlargement, the proper functioning of the institutions and the efficiency of the decision-making process."
"This document represents a sound basis for the negotiations which lie ahead, making it possible - by means of a more determined search for balance and compromise - to achieve the aims and aspirations contained in the preamble, and to arrive at the date set for the ending of the IGC - June 1997 - with a new, updated Treaty on European Union which is equal to the challenges of the twenty-first century, above all the future enlargement."
"Mr President, the Irish presidency has other merits, which I shall not list here because time is short."
"Ireland has now handed over to the Netherlands; let us all unite to contribute in a productive, clear and cohesive way to the next six months of building Europe."
"Mr President, because of lack of time, I shall restrict myself to a brief and thus incomplete political assessment of the Ministerial Conference in Singapore."
"In general terms, one can say that the results were positive."
"The World Trade Organization has emerged strengthened from the conference."
"One of the major gains was certainly the reaching of a multilateral agreement on information technology - the key sector for today and the future, which already has a worldwide turnover of USD 400 billion."
"The establishment of a working group on public procurement is definitely important."
"This will enable further proposals to be drawn up on competition, investment and transparency in public spending."
"Unfortunately, we also have to note that little or no progress has been made on other issues, some of which were among our priorities."
"On the environment, we can say that nothing at all has been achieved."
"Even worse, the subject was hardly mentioned."
"As regards the social clauses, the situation is that, in terms of our positions, very little has been achieved."
"But our efforts were not entirely in vain: the fact that the social clause and, in particular, the reference to minimum labour standards were included in the final declaration can be regarded as a victory, given the very strong opposition from the developing countries."
"On the institutional side, the fact that the European Parliament was able to put forward its proposals on the spot, for the very first time since GATT came into being, strengthens our role in the general decision-making of the Union."
"However, it remains the case that Parliament's status at such a conference is unclear."
"Amongst other things, it does not allow us to exercise real control over the Commission."
"We should give our full attention to this aspect in future, especially in the light of the revision of the Treaties, and with a view to the next conference of the World Trade Organization."
"Mr President, the Dublin Summit was yet another step towards the exacerbation of poverty and unemployment in the European Union."
"Ignoring the intense disappointment and indignation felt by European citizens, the leaders of the Union's Member States went ahead and accepted the anti-populist stability pact, disregarded the dramatic consequences for the productive base, employment and social welfare in all the countries, especially the poorer ones, and insisted on imposing the so-called curative policies, in other words intense one-sided austerity, further dislocation of the labour market and strict financial adaptation, which are strangling development."
"The Dublin Summit contributed to the further militarization of the European Union, a fact which intensifies the disquiet of Europe's peoples, who are striving for peace and social prosperity and for the dissolution of cold-war relics such as NATO and the Western European Union, peoples which demand binding national referenda to express their opinion and decide for themselves what Europe's future should be."
"Concerning enlargement, Mr President, I should like to record my grave concern about the presidency's apparent intention that negotiations on the possible future accession of Cyprus to the European Union should not go ahead exclusively with the legitimate Cyprus Government, a concern whose intensity increases in light of the continuing silence of the European Union's institutional bodies in the face of statements by Turkish government and military agencies threatening military action against Cyprus in response to its reinforcement of its own defence."
"The European Union must unequivocally condemn this aggressive attitude and action by Turkey."
"Mr President, we all know that the WTO has a central role to play in the fair regulation of international trade relations."
"The holding of the Singapore Conference thus represents an undeniable advance, valuable in defining agreements that will help to move mankind forward in the right direction."
"But that conference has highlighted some very different approaches and concepts, especially as regards social standards."
"To think it sufficient to stress that problem in a final declaration and then go away with a clear conscience, or to believe that it is enough to refer the question to the ILO on the pretext that international trade and social rights should be kept separate, is irresponsible to say the least, especially bearing in mind the limitations of that institution's power to act."
"I would call this a retreat forwards. Above all, it demonstrates the political desire of certain Union governments to submerge the question of social standards in the WTO."
"I take a very dim view of the Union's failure to present a united front."
"We were not all singing from the same hymn book in this area, which played into the hands of certain developing countries."
"I take a very dim view of it because the Union could, and should, have done more to achieve the setting-up of a working group on social standards within the WTO."
"Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy to arrive at the best compromise at such difficult meetings as Singapore."
"But I find it shocking, and even pathetic, that developed countries could barter information technologies, whisky and brandy for the exploitation of millions of children who are being forced to work - work to death, in some cases - and whose numbers are still growing according to the ILO itself."
"You will understand my reaction, which is that humanity should take precedence over financial gain, a reaction that keeps faith with the values of democracy, solidarity and humanitarianism."
"My profound desire is that the Union should take strong action against any failure to respect human rights in the field of labour, and that it should not hesitate to take the necessary steps when specific illegal acts become known, as in Burma and elsewhere."
"So we have a choice. Either we succeed in introducing social standards into the WTO, or we shall see the proliferation of social struggles in countries regarded as politically and socially stable."
"What is happening in South Korea today should be seen as a grave warning."
"Mr President, the Irish proposal covers issues which are of the utmost importance."
"There has already been a good deal of debate about these and I have no wish to go over the same ground again."
"Who could fail to approve in principle of the programmes that have been outlined: on the issue of fundamental rights, for example, or freedom of movement, on strengthening the common foreign and security policy and doing more to combat crime?"
"The people who elected us - and to pre-empt Mr Brok, that means one third of the voters in Austria - also appreciate the importance of all these values and know that we must go on working to maintain and consolidate them."
"But they know too that the Member States and their representatives are broadly of one mind on the basic issues which the document addresses in detail."
"What they do not know is what the Intergovernmental Conference will make of the Treaty as a whole, in other words to what extent the Treaty that is arrived at will differ from the one to which they gave their approval."
"That is why we regret the fact - which has been mentioned by a number of speakers - that some important practical questions for Europe's future, in particular institutional questions, have been left unresolved for tactical reasons, and discussion of them has been postponed."
"We do not believe that we shall be able to counter people's anxiety regarding future developments or achieve the much-vaunted goal of transparency if we keep the public in the dark."
"On the contrary, that would serve to heighten their concern about creeping centralism, as would remarks such as those made by Commissioner Fischler, who told an Austrian newspaper that he would flatly reject the European Parliament being involved in deciding his budget."
"Concerns of this nature are also being aroused, however, by the planned extension of majority decision-making and the suggestion from the presidency, in its conclusions on the second Dublin summit, that the legal framework for the introduction of the euro should be based on Article 235 of the EC Treaty. This suggestion, which is being heard more and more frequently and has also been made in a study by Mr Bandet, demonstrates the tendency on the part of the Community, regardless of the formal commitment to subsidiarity, to use dubious legal grounds for laying claim to powers to which we believe it has no right."
"Mr President, I also wish to offer my sincere congratulations to the Irish presidency on its success in carrying out the task - which it took on at a difficult time in the life of the Union - of drawing up a draft treaty to serve as the guidelines for the final stage of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference, to which I shall now restrict my comments, as chairman of Parliament's Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"Parliament clearly set out its position on the IGC in the two resolutions contained in the Martin/Bourlanges and Dury/Maij-Weggen reports."
"I would refer Members to those reports, with which they will be familiar."
"The guidelines that were approved at the Dublin summit indicate the course to be adopted in the final stage of the negotiations."
"Given Parliament's wish to be involved in the work of the IGC, we are bound to point out certain inadequacies, ambiguities and shortcomings in this document."
"The proposals on extending the codecision procedure are imprecise."
"The IGC is on the right track, but little has actually been decided or laid down."
"The subject of majority voting in the Council - which is a crucial issue in the present Union, and will be even more so following enlargement - is not addressed."
"Nor has much progress been made in setting out precise proposals for combating unemployment, which is the scourge of the European Union and modern civilization as a whole."
"The document contains other inadequacies, ambiguities and shortcomings."
"The proposals concerning external policy and the instruments for carrying it out are not bold enough, and the Commission's role in this area is not defined."
"There are no clear proposals on the CFSP either, nor any substantial proposals, but only hints, on the subject of European citizenship."
"And the questions of enhanced cooperation and flexibility, which will probably be the two concepts that will make possible a Union of not only 15 but 20 or more, are dealt with ambiguously."
"It is to be hoped that during these final six months - the six months of the Dutch presidency - this ambiguity will be eliminated and these concepts will be fleshed out."
"Lastly, the European Parliament's relationship with the national parliaments is not clearly defined in these guidelines, which nonetheless constitute a framework which we believe to be very important, and on which we offer our sincere congratulations to the Irish presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add a few words on the conference in Singapore."
"It is always a matter of some surprise to me how we in this Parliament, instead of acknowledging the achievements of a major conference such as Dublin or a successful conference like Singapore, manage rather to denigrate that success by making excessive demands."
"Surely, as the European Parliament, we too must be able once in a while to acknowledge positive results - so that when the people outside hear us, they will see that progress is being made - instead of always using the same negative yardstick. What use is that to anyone?"
"And when the individual speakers come to realize afterwards what thanks they get for adopting such an approach, they will see that they are appreciated only by themselves, and even that appreciation is misplaced."
"Together, we experienced a conference in Singapore which opened against a background of heavy scepticism."
"It was the first conference to review the functioning of the WTO, and the decisions at it were taken by a consensus procedure involving 150 countries."
"The 15 countries of the European Union, which were represented by the voices of the Council and, in particular, the Commission, could achieve nothing if a single country - Albania, for example, or any of the others - refused its assent."
"Under such circumstances, the conference was an important and positive milestone as regards the future development of the WTO."
"I should like to make that point here, and I should also like to convey to the Council my appreciation of the fact that it worked: that we spoke with one voice in Singapore."
"The person to whom we owe that achievement is Sir Leon Brittan, and I should like to thank him in particular for the committed approach which he took, in close contact, of course, with 15 different ministers who subordinated their own interests to the fact that they had made the Commission their spokesman."
"In my opinion, we as a Parliament were, so far as possible, well integrated in the process."
"We went to Singapore in order to take part, and that should continue to be our practice in future."
"I am fundamentally grateful for that, even if parliaments never achieve everything they might wish."
"We must also be very satisfied as regards the results of the conference."
"The conclusion of an agreement on information technology products, with the green light for a future deal on telecommunications, is an historic event in terms of the further development of world trade."
"It will contribute to prosperity and encourage free trade; we can all see it as something extremely positive - and we should be saying so."
"My final point is this: of course, the emerging and developing countries are in an extremely difficult situation."
"We read every day about the troubles which are taking place in those countries and how poverty in their societies is on the increase, and it is understandable that people there should fear that we are seeking, by laying down environmental and social standards, to make them less competitive."
"What is needed is mouth-to-mouth resuscitation: a real and continuing effort to convince these countries that it is in their own interest for us to move forward together."
"Singapore was a successful conference."
"As the European Union, we can take pride in our presence there, and I would only say that if we can sustain this kind of development, we shall also, in the long term, achieve our goal of free world trade."
"Mr President, I too would like to talk about Singapore, and I believe we should have had a separate debate on this important subject."
"I wish to raise in particular the cases of China and Taiwan."
"China would rightly complain if - after satisfactory economic negotiations - political objections were raised to its entry."
"The same logic must apply to Taiwan."
"Economic negotiations on Taiwan's entry to the WTO could be completed easily - possibly within weeks."
"They should be."
"And Taiwan, a major trading power and an important democracy, should be allowed in."
"It is unhealthy for the world's trading arrangements to continue to exclude the Republic of China, because of the demands of the People's Republic of China."
"The difference in this case between a 'Republic' and a 'People's Republic' is like the difference between a jacket and a straitjacket."
"Of course we must bring the People's Republic in too - as soon as certain basic conditions have been met."
"This would strengthen the WTO and help reform in China."
"Under President Clinton's new China policy the American and European positions are much closer."
"We in the ELDR Group urge our negotiators to redouble their efforts to achieve a solution to these problems."
"And if they were not discussed in Singapore we would like to know why."
"Mr President, we had Dublin and we had Singapore."
"In Dublin, the pact of budgetary discipline was adopted."
"After half a century of Keynesianism we were told that wealth comes from the quest for the grail of the balanced budget."
"I have studied all the statistical surveys of nineteenth century American public finance and European public finance and I have never come across a balanced budget."
"It is true that a stability pact has been adopted, with a budgetary criminal law that allows countries found drunk in charge of a budget to be punished for it."
"Then there was the single currency we have been promised for 1999, and the social clause drafted as if the country of Adam Smith, creator of the universal poverty of nations, could at the same time rediscover ultra-liberalism and talk about social affairs."
"Fortunately, we also had Singapore."
"Clearly, we avoided disaster in Singapore, because we planned to reopen the agriculture file and then didn't."
"But, Mr Santer, let us not go back to Punta del Este."
"The United States has adopted the Fair act."
"In April 1996 it severed the link between production and aid, and it is occupying a position of strength with a view to reopening negotiations at the end of the year 2000."
"Let us not lag behind, Mr Santer."
"It is true that the President-in-Office has told us that an area of philosophy has been created."
"That is Dublin's great contribution."
"But I would remind you that Descartes was born in France, published his works in the Low Countries and died in Sweden."
"He too, along with Spinoza, invented the European area of philosophy, before Dublin."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency and, in particular, the Prime Minister and the Irish Finance Minister, for the progress that was made on economic and monetary union."
"December 1996 will be seen as a watershed for the whole process of economic and monetary union."
"It was the pivotal point where economic and monetary union went from simply being an aspiration of the European Union to becoming a reality."
"It will be an important point in Europe's history."
"But I want to turn my attention to the Pact for Stability and Growth."
"Let us not forget that it is called a Pact for Stability and Growth."
"It is crucial that the agreement that was reached in Dublin is implemented as it is written."
"I hope that all the people who signed up to that agreement, on the Pact for Stability and Growth, will honour it as it is written and that there will be no rearguard action either by members of the Monetary Committee or the Central Bankers or, indeed, any particular Finance Minister from any major Member State in the European Union to undermine the compromise that was reached in Dublin on that pact."
"If there is an attempt at any stage to try and change that agreement or make it less rigorous, then this Parliament will roundly condemn it."
"It is essential that the Irish Prime Minister and the incoming Dutch presidency honour that agreement."
"Secondly, I want to turn to something that the Irish Prime Minister, Mr Bruton, said about the role of government in trying to create jobs and boost the economy."
"I was rather disappointed, given the excellent partnership between the public and the private sectors in Ireland in helping to realise the very high growth rates in Ireland in recent years, that the Prime Minister should say that in a market economy there is little role for government action."
"The multiplier effect of public investment has a crucial role in boosting growth and boosting employment."
"If you look at the Irish economy, Prime Minister, you will see that in your own economy the role of public investment has been absolutely crucial in getting the sort of growth rates that you have had in recent years."
"That is why we need concerted action at European level: a common economic policy, particularly in the field of public investment, so that we can boost growth rates and tackle the unemployment problem."
"The final point I want to make is in relation to the way in which we now have a centralized monetary policy and what we do on economic policy."
"I address this to President Santer and to the Irish Prime Minister."
"During the course of 1997 it is absolutely essential that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament seek to establish a mechanism as a counterweight to the centralized monetary authority of the European Central Bank so that we have some sort of economic governance within the European Union."
"That means a strengthened Economic and Finance Committee of Finance Ministers; it means a stronger role for the European Commission; it means a stronger overseeing role for the European Parliament."
"That must be our objective during 1997."
"I hope the Commission and the Council will come forward with proposals on this matter."
"Mr President, like so many others, I want to congratulate the Irish presidency on the success of its term of office and to say that because smaller countries have fewer resources, the success which they achieve therefore deserves greater commendation."
"I want to compliment Mr Bruton the Taoiseach , Mr Spring the T√°naiste and Mr Mitchell all of whom worked extremely hard and contributed immensely to that success."
"I want also to acknowledge today that it was not just while Mr Bruton was President-in-Office that he was dedicated to the European ideal."
"All through the years he has promoted the European ideal and been a hard-working and well-informed advocate of European Union."
"It is particularly important to say that at this time."
"In his New Year message, speaking to his own people in his own state, he set out as one of his three objectives to work for the creation of a federal Europe."
"It is easier for us in the institutions to advocate these things; we are expected to do so."
"In the years immediately ahead we have three important tasks to accomplish. I refer to the Intergovernmental Conference, the single currency and enlargement."
"Some of these things, in particular enlargement, will not be achieved without sacrifices by the people who are in the European Union at the present."
"If we are to achieve success in this area, we cannot do it by making agreements between our own institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"We must win over national public opinion."
"National and regional parliaments have a very big role to play."
"That is why I appreciate so much the long-standing service to the European ideal in the Irish context which the present Prime Minister of Ireland Mr Bruton has given and in which he has been well supported by Mr Mitchell."
"I want to refer briefly to the statement by Ms McKenna that European monetary union is a bad thing and that Ireland should not be involved."
"She based this on our trade flows with the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe."
"Her figures are out of date."
"Today we export 40 % of our goods to the hard-core countries of the European Union and 28.5 % to the British market."
"I would remind her that in the 170 years of monetary union with Britain we made less progress than in the 17 years of monetary agreement with the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, I hope you will forgive me, but I see the results of the Irish presidency and the Dublin summit above all in terms of their value as a starting-point for the Dutch presidency, especially when it comes to employment."
"Without wishing to criticize the Irish presidency in this respect, I would nevertheless point out that there is so much fog surrounding these issues that I cannot say that things have now been made so clear that nothing can go wrong with the Dutch presidency."
"Our aim with the creation of the chapter on employment was that a balance should at least be established between monetary policy, on the one hand, and the policy on growth, employment and cohesion in the Community on the other."
"When we look at the results of your presidency, I have to say, in any event, that such a balance is not present in the draft treaty."
"According to this proposal, employment policy has to be in keeping with the economic guidelines; that is the only thing which is said on the matter, but the reverse must also be the case."
"That is now precisely the point at issue."
"One cannot simply continue with an economic and monetary policy without, at the same time, taking account of the effects on employment - and not only on the people who are already in work, but on the many millions who are outside the employment process and who, despite the financial measures taken in recent years, have still not found a job."
"I hope that this fact will be brought home clearly once again in the summit discussions."
"In short, there is a great deal more to be done here, not least because the proposal from the Dutch presidency does indeed suffer from the same fault."
"The inclusion of the Essen procedure in the treaty, which we now seem to have in mind, is totally inadequate."
"We also need a timetable and specific aims and indicators."
"Only then will we be able to overcome the lack of commitment in the declarations."
"Finally, I should like to make another comment on the opening statement by Mr Bruton, which contained a plea for more education and training."
"On the face of it, that is a reasonable point to make, but it is precisely because the Member States have drastically reduced their expenditure on education and training in recent years."
"That also has a great deal to do with EMU, and now with the stability pact."
"But I would commend to the House a scientific report which appeared in my own country yesterday and which points out that, however important education and training may be in terms of 'employability' , they do not create a single new job."
"Here I would quote Mrs Papandreou, the former Commissioner, who told the House that there are now people in Europe who have been trained and retrained six or seven times, and who are still waiting for a job."
"This point is still being ignored, it is still thought that education and training, that economic stability will automatically lead to employment."
"That is nonsense, unless there is an accompanying policy aimed specifically at creating jobs."
"I should like to see Mr Santer's stability pact focusing on that in the first instance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the third pillar: about what Dublin has achieved so far in that area, and about our expectations for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Our most important project in this respect is Europol."
"Everything was agreed in the Maastricht Treaty, then long drawn-out negotiations on the convention caused delays, and now the project has become bogged down in ratification procedures in the national parliaments."
"The fact that Europol is not yet operational is scandalous."
"Now it is up to the national parliaments to do their best to give Europol a chance to work."
"My second point concerns the growing belief that Europol needs to be given power to act on its own initiative."
"It would use that power not to displace national police forces, but rather to have optimal scope for action - not as a European FBI, but simply as a European police authority with responsibility for certain serious crimes which have a European dimension."
"That is the direction - already mapped out by Parliament - which the Intergovernmental Conference has to take."
"My third point is this: we all wish to see substantial sections of the third pillar brought under the Community umbrella."
"This applies in particular to asylum and immigration, and quite rightly so."
"When borders within Europe disappear, only Community legislation on asylum will be successful."
"However, if we take that view, then it is time we made efforts to draft joint asylum legislation."
"Practical joint legislation on asylum is therefore the third requirement to emerge from the Dublin summit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not always share Mr Nassauer's views, but on this occasion I have to agree with him entirely."
"It is indeed one of the most shameful results of the Dublin summit - and the fault not of the Irish presidency, in my opinion, but rather of the obstructive approach on the part of certain Member State governments - that ringing declarations are still being made about Europol as the body which is about to crack organized crime in Europe."
"The fact is that, apart from the ringing declarations, there is no movement at all on Europol."
"Europol was supposed to be the magic solution for combating drug-related crime."
"But is Europol combating drugrelated crime?"
"No."
"Europol was supposed to be the magic solution for combating crime involving nuclear materials - an issue, I might add, which has completely disappeared from public debate."
"Is it the case that nuclear materials are no longer being smuggled in Europe?"
"Probably not, because it is no longer election time in Germany."
"It was said at the last summit in Dublin that Europol was to be an instrument for combating the sexual abuse of children, and that action in that area was urgently needed."
"But no action is being taken."
"We in Parliament have long been aware that in the Member States, the reservations over national sovereignty - and that is ultimately what is at issue - are more important than taking effective action against crime at European level."
"The members of our group have no hope of a change of attitude in the Council of Ministers or on the part of the Member State governments."
"It is to you that we look, Mr President of the Commission."
"You ought to be able to take the initiative, for example by asking the Member States to make operational resources available to your Commission departments which are responsible for third-pillar matters, so that they at least could function effectively."
"I am thinking of UCLAF, the anti-fraud unit, which could be much more active in tackling organized crime."
"If for once the Commission - instead of taking time off to celebrate apparent decisions at summit meetings, which were not really decisions at all - could decide to call on the Member State governments to put deeds before words at long last in the fight against organized crime, then you could be sure, Mr Santer, that we would applaud you."
"But there will be no applause if you continually issue the kind of statements in which you mention all the things which have been decided but not actually implemented."
"Be more courageous, and you will have Parliament on your side."
"Mr President, in terms of square miles, Ireland is not one the largest Member States of the European Union, but it is a major player in terms of what it has achieved."
"John Bruton's government deserves every respect for the high level of commitment and ability and the energetic initiatives which it brought to the Council presidency."
"It built conceptual bridges and demanded practical results, instead of issuing the customary high-sounding but insubstantial declarations."
"As to whether Dublin's 'performance enhancement' approach also worked in the area of main priority, which is the battle to reduce the figure of 18 million unemployed, it did manage to create a new level of awareness among the Member States and to link a number of measures in order to make them effective."
"The measures in question include, firstly, special support for the target groups of the long-term unemployed and unemployed women and young people, involving employment initiatives at local and regional level; secondly, a significant increase in the quality of training and continuing education, to get us in shape for international competition and make us more flexible and mobile; and, thirdly, the implementation of the programmes agreed for SMEs, where sound structures and a capacity for innovation will generate new jobs."
"Clearly, we are only at the start of the necessary process of dismantling administrative and fiscal barriers."
"I would also comment that Mr Santer's confidence pact has been steadily gaining support."
"Rapprochement between the Member States, which was tried successfully in Essen two years ago and has now been documented in the Dublin declaration, is the best way to achieve greater joint responsibility, coordination and cooperation at European level."
"There is less reason than ever to oppose a meaningful future Treaty chapter on employment."
"Mr President, in my two minutes I wish to focus briefly on one aspect of the outcome of the WTO Conference in Singapore: the question of observance of internationally recognized core labour standards in worldtrading arrangements."
"In doing so, I would like to pay tribute to Minister Enda Kenny, the Irish Trade Minister, for his strenuous efforts to achieve a positive consensus position for the Union on this matter in Singapore."
"That was no easy task given the hostile position of some of our own Member States, not least the United Kingdom, to any mention at all of core labour standards in the final declaration."
"Some will be disappointed with the paragraph on labour standards which appeared in the final declaration because it does little more than reaffirm a commitment to the principle of such standards, underline the role of the ILO and note the need for continuing collaboration between the ILO and WTO secretariats on this matter."
"The issue is not made an operational matter within the WTO framework, and I share the frustration of Mr Sainjon in this respect."
"But, having been at that conference in Singapore and having witnessed outright the hostility to any mention of these matters from a number of developed as well as developing nations, rather than feeling disappointment, I share the view of Willy De Clercq, the head of our delegation there, that the fact that this matter was not excluded from the negotiations should in itself be counted a success."
"The flame has been kept alive."
"That is not sufficient."
"The Socialist Group calls upon both the Commission and the Council in their preparatory work for the next ministerial conference - and that needs to begin now - to build upon the reference that we now have to ensure that progress is made on core labour standards, as well as environmental standards, and to ensure that we have world trade which is fair as well as free."
"I wish to thank the Irish presidency sincerely for its valuable work on this issue."
"Mr President, the Irish presidency was right to highlight the successes that have been achieved in preparing for monetary union."
"They are to be welcomed."
"At last, we can appreciate how great the international impact of monetary union is going to be, because we need a stable monetary framework at international level too, after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system."
"We cannot allow speculators to gain a stranglehold on our economies, any more than we can leave trade and the economy entirely to market forces."
"So the conference in Singapore was certainly a success as regards the further opening-up of markets and making further progress towards deregulation."
"In our view, however, a great deal still remains to be done - and not least by the European Union - if the demands which Parliament has made are to be pursued with vigour."
"In particular, more progress is needed on achieving fair international trade."
"Our system of rules is far too underdeveloped, not only in the area of social and environmental standards, but also in relation to the way in which international competition operates."
"We cannot adopt legislation against monopolies and cartels within the European Union, and then at the same time allow such cartels and monopolies at international level and offer them stability."
"That is why we need a system of international competition that will help to make fair international trade a reality."
"The same is true in the other area to which I referred."
"Europe must speak with a single voice here - something which it failed to do in Singapore."
"A presidency and a Commission cannot achieve anything when it becomes clear in Singapore that the European Union is divided on the question of rules in this area."
"Progress must be made here."
"We cannot steer a course on the basis that free international trade will continue to be successful and contribute to the growth of national economies because it is based on exploiting human beings and despoiling nature and resources."
"We cannot simply now set aside the Lyons employment summit."
"I can only take a cynical view of the declarations by the G7 Heads of State and Government on exploiting the opportunities offered by globalization, when people and the planet are the victims of such a policy."
"That is why we need what GATT and the WTO have always sought to achieve: fair international trade, governed by rules, on the lines that we in the European Parliament have always advocated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all of you for your kind remarks with regard to the Irish presidency and in particular for the well-deserved praise of Minister of State Gay Mitchell who handled relations with Parliament on behalf of the Irish presidency."
"I simply wish to make four points in conclusion."
"This is the second time in my life that I have spoken before the European Parliament, the first being in September."
"In that debate there was an atmosphere of pervasive pessimism and criticism of the performance of Europe."
"The atmosphere in this debate is entirely different."
"It is a positive debate where people are demanding that Europe should do more but in those demands there is the underlying feeling that they are confident that Europe has the capacity to do more."
"That change of atmosphere from September to January is a great credit to the leadership of Parliament and it is also a sign of health in Europe."
"Secondly, the treaty which the Irish presidency presented in draft form in Dublin is a treaty for the people."
"It is a treaty for the citizens of Europe."
"It is not a treaty for an economic entity alone."
"It contains provisions in regard to stronger action on crime and drugs."
"It contains for the first time provisions in regard to guaranteeing individual human rights."
"It introduces for the first time into the Treaty the concept of sustainable development, a matter of great importance to all of us who concern ourselves with the environment."
"It strengthens the provision in the Treaty in regard to the protection of the consumer as opposed to protection of the producer."
"It also explicitly brings about for the first time a position of equality between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in regard to co-decision."
"These points show that this treaty is bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"(Applause) This brings me to my third point."
"This treaty has to be ratified."
"It will not be ratified unless citizens understand that it contains something valuable for them."
"As was apparent in the debate, this is not a matter about which we can be in the least complacent. In all our discussions of the treaty it is very important that we continue to remember that we must translate the treaty language into something that will actually make people willing to leave their television sets, the place where they are having dinner with their family and go to a polling station somewhere in Europe and vote Yes."
"That requires an effort of communication."
"We must not just get it right; but we must also simplify it and make it something that contains an emotional message that people will respond to positively."
"That is the political challenge that we face."
"Finally, I agree very strongly with all those Members who made the point, in particular with regard to Europol, that it is not enough to adopt a treaty or a declaration unless ratification and implementation in the Member States is as strong as the political will to adopt the provision in the first place."
"In that respect Parliament must be vigilant in regard to any backsliding by individual Member States."
"I accept all the criticisms directed at Member States in this area of failure to implement declarations."
"Our record is not brilliant and indeed the record of those who are most eloquent in favour of the adoption of common European positions is often the worst in terms of putting them into practical action, and frequently the record of those who are most critical and slowest in adopting common European positions is often the best in turning them into reality."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"I have received nine motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The debate is closed."
"Election of Quaestors (continuation)"
"I can announce the results of the third ballot for the election of Quaestors:"
"Members voting: 464 Blank or void ballots: 9 Votes cast: 455"
"The results are as follows:"
"Mr Killilea: 194 votes Mr Paasio: 214 votes Mr Viola: 169 votes"
"As a result of the third ballot, I declare Mr Paasio and Mr Killilea elected Quaestors of the European Parliament and congratulate them on their election."
"Pursuant to Rule 16, the Quaestors will take precedence in the order in which they were elected."
"Vote (number and membership of committees)"
"The next item is the vote on the motion for a resolution (B4-0028/97) on the number and membership of parliamentary committees."
"Amendment No 1 has been withdrawn."
"I give the floor to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy on a point of order."
"Mr President, regarding Amendment No 1, to which you just referred, I should like to thank the honourable Members who agreed to join me in signing it, and I should also like to thank the PPE Group for giving up a seat on the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to enable all the groups to be represented on that committee."
"The question raised by the amendment related, in fact, to the representation of all the political groups on the committees."
"I think you should refer to the Rules Committee the practice which has grown up over the last few years of neutralizing certain committees, which I believe is a violation of Rule 135, which provides for equitable representation of all political groups and Non-Attached Members on committees, without making any distinction between the committees that are not neutralized and those that are."
"It is not proper that the Conference of Presidents should be able to make a proposal to any parliamentary committee on which one political group is not represented, and of course that applies especially to the Rules Committee."
"I think that this point should be cleared up and that Rule 135 should be interpreted in its correct sense."
"Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"I shall consider your request."
"In any event, as an active substitute member of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, you know as well as I do that any Member or political group can bring before that committee whatever matters they think fit."
"I put the proposal for a decision as a whole to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Programme of the Dutch presidency and the situation in Serbia"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the Dutch presidency, including the situation in Serbia."
"I give the floor to Mr van Mierlo, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we like to say that Europe is the cradle of democracy, but no one can deny that there is still a gap between the process of European integration and securing democratic legitimation for it."
"And however we might try to explain this, the fact remains that there is a gap to be bridged."
"It is with this in mind that I appear before the House."
"It is a great honour for me to be here with you, particularly as you elected a new President yesterday."
"Allow me to congratulate you on your election, Mr President, and to wish you strength and wisdom in your new position."
"I hope that our meeting today will lay the foundations for constructive cooperation between the Council and Parliament over the next six months."
"The programme for the Dutch presidency has been described as austere, which is an accurate but incomplete description."
"We are austere because we are ambitious."
"We are modest not in our aims, but in how we set about them."
"We do not have either the time or the space to concentrate on a few national priorities."
"The European agenda is the only one we are pursuing, and I cannot conceive of any greater ambition at the moment than using this agenda to achieve the results that Europe needs."
"It was with this in mind that the Netherlands drew up its programme for the next six months, and the energetic work of our Irish predecessors has been of great assistance here."
"You should already have received the written text of our programme, and I shall focus in my address now on the main policy challenges that are facing us."
"We tend to regard the turn of a century as far more important than just the next number in the series."
"Whichever way one looks at it, it is certainly true that the coming millennium coincides with far-reaching changes in Europe, changes which could finally heal the memory of our darkest hours."
"This is not just some law of nature taking its course, it is an historic opportunity to be grasped and shaped."
"It is an opportunity not to be missed."
"For some years now, we have been discussing the dilemma of whether we should consolidate or expand."
"Where should our priority lie?"
"Recent events in Europe have shown that we can no longer remain intellectually uncommitted in this debate."
"No one can go on claiming to support consolidation or enlargement in the secret hope that this will give the alternative less chance."
"With the fall of the Berlin Wall, enlargement became an historical imperative, but at the same time we realized that we cannot expand without consolidating, so it became a case of doing both."
"We are approaching enlargement of the European Union on the largest possible scale, an enlargement that will finally give the Union the right to call itself 'European' ."
"At the same time, we are working on the most intensive policy consolidation that integration will ever face, in the shape of economic and monetary union."
"We wondered what stage we would have reached in the progress of European integration when we took over the responsibilities of the presidency, and here we are on the threshold of two fundamental changes in European development: enlargement and the establishment of European monetary union."
"But Europe is not quite ready for them."
"That is why the Netherlands has two main aims: to produce a treaty in six months, and to produce a treaty of substance, a treaty that will enable us to handle these two changes."
"Our first concern is therefore the management of the IGC and the management of the run-up to EMU and enlargement."
"There are also certain foreign policy issues which are of such magnitude and such vital importance for Europe that they simply have to be given priority."
"I should like to begin by saying something about the Intergovernmental Conference, EMU and enlargement."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is taking place in the run-up to the 21st century, a century which must see an undivided Europe."
"We are determined that the IGC will be concluded on time and will produce substantial results."
"Our Irish predecessors have laid solid foundations for this, and further impetus has been provided by France, Germany, Portugal and the Benelux countries."
"The European Parliament has played an active part, both through its resolutions on IGC issues and through the constructive contributions of its Members - Mr Brok and Mrs Guigou - in the negotiating group."
"There is a good deal of work still to be done, starting with the more sensitive areas where little progress has been made, such as institutional reform."
"I am thinking here of more decision-making by a qualified majority and relations between the institutions, including the European Parliament."
"Even sensitive issues such as flexibility are going to have to be discussed in more practical terms."
"Flexibility is the key to eliminating the apparent opposition between consolidation and enlargement."
"The ability to be flexible should allow scope for both, whereas without flexibility, a much larger Union will grind to a halt."
"But it is also a medicine to be taken sparingly and carefully: too large a dose, and the Union will fragment."
"This will undoubtedly be the most difficult intellectual issue for the IGC to resolve, just as the institutions are going to be the most difficult political problem."
"We are going to have to take immediate action in both areas in order to fill the blank spaces in Ireland's blueprint as quickly as possible."
"We need to maintain the progress we have made in other areas."
"I am pleased to see the trend towards giving Parliament greater legislative powers, and we shall be strongly supporting this, along with the idea of giving you greater involvement in the appointment of the Commission."
"Should the gap in European democracy not be closed from both sides?"
"If so, then we need to ask whether and how the national parliaments can play a greater role in Europe, without undermining the position of the European Parliament."
"We agree that the Union is finally playing the kind of effective and coherent international role that is in keeping with its position."
"But this is not to say that a genuine European foreign policy is not proving hard to get off the ground."
"Why should this be so?"
"The accepted line is that there are major differences in national interests, but are these really as important as is always assumed?"
"On closer inspection, I cannot help feeling that for the few genuine differences that exist, there are also many hypothetical ones."
"Are the latter sort mainly intended to protect national identities?"
"If so, then what is happening is the opposite of what we claim: policy is not being made for the benefit of interests, but interests are being invented for the benefit of policy."
"All the more reason to have done with our crippling reliance on unanimity."
"Improving our approach towards justice and home affairs - the crucial area of internal security - also needs to be put high on the agenda for early discussion at the IGC."
"The Union must be able to act more decisively in combating growing transfrontier crime and drug trafficking."
"The Dublin European Council proposed various measures on which we have already set to work, and we have far from exhausted all the possibilities for increasing practical cooperation between the national authorities in this area."
"The formulation of the new treaty is now entering its decisive phase."
"There will only be a new treaty if everyone makes an effort, and not for the 'honour of Amsterdam' or some such thing: we are the ones whose honour it will be to make Amsterdam a success."
"Economic and monetary union is irrevocably on its way towards the third stage."
"A solid and stable euro is now within our sights, if we can achieve a firm stability and growth pact and agreement on the structure of a new exchange rate mechanism and the legal framework for the euro."
"This presidency will do everything it can to maintain the dynamism and credibility of the process, first of all by implementing the political decisions taken at Dublin in the fields I have just mentioned."
"Let me make our position quite clear on the question of membership."
"It is quite simple: every country which meets the criteria is welcome - the more the merrier."
"Enlarging the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean will demand great efforts on their part, but also on ours."
"For me it is clear that, without strong foundations, the Union will not come through a further substantial enlargement unscathed."
"The need for substantive results from the Intergovernmental Conference thus lies at the very heart of the Union's preparations, and indeed of our presidency."
"The applicant countries will need to make intensive preparations for accession, particularly if they are to be able to participate in the internal market properly."
"Accession also needs to have the broadest possible support in the countries concerned, and this will not be gained simply by technical, abstract arguments, but by genuine, intensive dialogue."
"This is how people grow to understand each other, and how expectations can be measured against realities."
"The disadvantage of the structured dialogue we are now conducting is that it is neither structured nor a dialogue."
"It is simply an exchange of ideas, and it needs to be brought down to a more practical level by focusing on just one or two problems that have been discussed in detail in advance."
"This goes for every aspect of integration, from the internal market to subjects such as the constitutional state and good governance."
"I have some further comments on the subject of enlargement."
"Achieving a peaceful, democratic and prosperous European continent in the next century is no longer a vision, but a political mission to ensure that the forthcoming enlargement is a success."
"The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, difficult and long, but what they will essentially be about is the question that is deeply rooted in our European culture: how do you reconcile the principle of 'equal opportunities' with the unequal abilities that we are faced with in reality?"
"I am aware that the absence of a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem could undermine enlargement as a whole."
"This being so, and also for the sake of the accession of Cyprus itself, we must ensure that the Union does everything it can to achieve a solution through intensive talks with all those involved, including Turkey, of course."
"We have already made a start on this, as well as on talks with the United States and the United Nations."
"It is vital that we should all work to the same agenda, and that there should be no hidden agendas either."
"I hope that you too will bear this in mind in your relations with that country."
"So far I have discussed the IGC, EMU and enlargement, which we see as a strategic triangle."
"But it does not stop there."
"The world around us is not waiting to see the outcome of the IGC, any more than our citizens and the economy are."
"For this reason, we shall be focusing on the continuing development of policy, legislation and the management and government of the Union."
"You will have read how we intend to do this in our programme for the presidency."
"Our major internal challenges are still creating more jobs, good working conditions, personal and public safety, and the protection of our precious environment."
"Combating racism will be given particular attention this year."
"The economic foundation of integration - its faithful workhorse - is still the internal market, whose operation requires our continual care and attention."
"We must not think of it in isolation."
"It is not just a question of creating a larger market as we move nearer to a single currency, it is also a question of how the market links up with the environment and the human dimension."
"We need to carry on giving close attention to our activities outside the Union, firstly because there are many violent regional conflicts which we cannot ignore, secondly because we need to stay alert to protect the Union's interests as a major economic power, and thirdly because the relationship between politics and economics in international relations has become much more complicated."
"Taking active measures to support human rights and democracy is also a major focus of our foreign policy, since these ideals lie at the very heart of European culture."
"However, there are also more practical reasons why we need to have a European policy on human rights, in that it has become more difficult for individual Member States to conduct such a policy effectively on a purely bilateral basis."
"Support for human rights and democracy also needs to form part of a broad-based and coherent approach to conflict prevention and management."
"There are a number of important regional challenges that face us."
"First of all there is the Middle East peace process where, for the first time in a long while, we now have, if not a breakthrough, then at least some clear progress."
"Yesterday evening's agreement on Hebron was an important step on the road to a just and stable peace, and could give the peace process the new momentum which it so desperately needs."
"I welcome the fact that the European Union has shown in the run-up to this agreement that, working in close cooperation with the parties involved and the United States, it can make a substantial contribution to the peace process which can go beyond providing economic support."
"Economics and politics cannot be clinically separated here."
"Without economic support from Europe, the entire negotiation process would clearly be jeopardized, and this gives the Union the right and the duty to play an active political role in the process - not primarily as a negotiator or mediator at the negotiating table, but a political role nonetheless."
"The recognition given by all the parties to the role played by our special envoy, Mr Moratinos, underlines this fact, and I should like to take this opportunity to express the presidency's appreciation of his commitment and effectiveness."
"The role of the European Union in former Yugoslavia is much more overtly political, since many Member States have sent troops there to support the diplomatic and humanitarian efforts."
"Careful attention and resourcefulness will be needed to maintain the momentum in implementing the peace agreements."
"The decisions of the Peace Implementation Council in London will be important here."
"Some of you have asked me to comment on the resolution before Parliament on former Yugoslavia."
"Although I naturally do not wish to pre-empt the vote on this resolution, I can assure you that the presidency supports its main thrust."
"The Council has clearly and repeatedly endorsed the conclusions of the Gonz√°lez report and called on President Milosevic to recognize the results of the elections of 17 November."
"I am currently visiting all the Member States to tell them the presidency's plans and to hear where their specific interests lie."
"Everyone naturally mentions the situation in Belgrade, and feelings about it are broadly the same everywhere."
"From the outset I have been, and still am, prepared to go to Belgrade as soon as we feel we can achieve something."
"But I want to be careful to pick the right moment."
"Recent reports from Belgrade seem to indicate that Mr Milosevic is gradually starting to listen to what people are saying, particularly the demonstrators."
"However, there is still a long way to go to democracy in former Yugoslavia, and until a satisfactory result has been achieved in Serbia, the world must keep up the pressure on Mr Milosevic and keep on supporting the opposition and the student movement."
"The plan for the post-Barcelona process is a good one and shows great promise for Euro-Mediterranean stability in the broad sense."
"However, its implementation very much depends on how existing regional conflicts develop, not the least of these being the Middle East peace process."
"The presidency will certainly be doing everything it can to promote the further development of the post-Barcelona process."
"We shall not accept the kind of split that is threatening to develop in the Council between the northern and southern Member States, with the southern countries in favour of enlargement in the Mediterranean and the northern countries in favour of enlargement eastwards."
"Stability in the Mediterranean affects everyone in the Union!"
"Spain, Italy and Greece's neighbours are also our neighbours up here in the north."
"That is why we, as a northern country, regard it as a privilege to be able to put this view into action by throwing all our energies into the co-presidency of the Barcelona process."
"Successful transatlantic relations remain the cornerstone of our external policy and are another area which must be given our undivided attention if they are to continue to be successful."
"The situation is no longer as it was in the Cold War, when we were totally dependent on nuclear weapons and the Americans."
"If we wish to maintain our relations, we are going to have to look after them, nurture them and invest in them."
"We must not limit transatlantic dialogue to simply business and economics, because at certain times it can be vital for America and Europe to take joint action on the world stage."
"Europe and America desperately need each other in a world where there are so many sources of instability."
"In so many fields - whether it be the world trade system, the management of regional crises or relations with Russia - close transatlantic cooperation is the only key to success."
"Inadequate cooperation, on the other hand, is a recipe for disaster."
"Where our cultures and interests coincide, we must join forces, for example to protect our common values in terms of human rights."
"Where there are differences, we must be able to discuss and deal with them."
"This is why we need to promote transatlantic dialogue and the implementation of the EU-US action plan."
"The terrible situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa naturally calls for action from the Union."
"In addition to providing humanitarian aid, we are going to have to address ourselves increasingly to conflict prevention and management."
"Here too, talks have already started with America to see whether we can decide on a joint approach to this very difficult issue."
"I know that I have by no means covered all our foreign policy areas, but I should like to conclude with a few thoughts on the changing nature of European integration."
"For a long time, many people saw European integration as a 'technical abstraction' , and it was regarded as a very marginal topic in the national political debate."
"The fall of communism and 'Maastricht' have put Europe at the very heart of national politics in all the Member States."
"Areas of traditional domestic policy have taken on a European dimension, whether people want them to or not, and these developments have dramatically changed the nature of integration."
"'Europe' used to mean a technical agenda 'over in Brussels' , but it is now increasingly becoming an accumulation of national sensitivities."
"This is an extremely difficult and unavoidable, but in my view not entirely negative development."
"It is difficult, certainly, since it has made the interaction between government and democracy at European and national levels much more complicated."
"But has not national government also become much more complicated?"
"We have nothing to teach each other on this point!"
"I often think that the crisis we have in Europe and the impotence we feel are really the sum of all the impotence felt in the Member States, which is why we have so little room for manoeuvre when we come to the negotiating table in Brussels."
"We have so little leeway at home that we cannot afford to go back with a message that our supporters will not find acceptable."
"It is difficult and unavoidable, but there is a positive side to it, in that it shows that integration is maturing."
"What is the point of European integration if it has not taken root in the minds of our citizens, or if it does not affect the things that are important to them?"
"People still find it easier to identify with their own country and their own region, but they are understanding more and more, and they see every day that there are so many things that go beyond what their own country can do."
"People and Europe are becoming increasingly aware of each other, yet they are still to far too great an extent strangers."
"President Vaclav Havel, who made a memorable speech to this House in 1994, had also identified this problem."
"On reading the Maastricht Treaty, he was astonished at the fact that common ground-rules should be laid down for such a disparate group of countries."
"He was impressed by the ingenious structure, but he concluded that: ' My reason has been spoken to, but not my heart' ."
"There is a difference between the lifeless letter of the Treaty and the living reality of integration, but the fact remains that the Union is an edifice that has been constructed, and is perceived as such by many people."
"However, the question for me is whether or not we can expect people to feel anything like passionate about Europe as an edifice."
"Has our European age not taught us all we need to know about the ambivalent relationship between emotion, statehood and war?"
"And is not this lesson we have learned the very raison d'√™tre for the edifice we call European integration?"
"Europeans need to be able to identify with the body governing them, but with what I would call rational emotion."
"We cannot force them to do this, of course, not if our capital cities play 'cat and mouse' with each other and with Brussels, or if democracy competes with itself at national and European levels."
"And certainly not if Europe makes exaggerated claims, since these simply lead to inevitable failure and thus generate discontent."
"However, looking no higher than the goals of realpolitik will not work either."
"Identification with Europe will only grow if our European edifice can do its job convincingly and if it has democratic legitimation, so it needs to be transparent and accessible too."
"It will also help to promote identification with Europe if the national politicians conduct a fair, open and conscientious debate that extends beyond their own borders."
"The increasing Europeanization of what I referred to earlier as national sensitivities makes this essential."
"Do we not now need to develop something like a new culture together?"
"The Treaty, in my view, need not speak to the heart, but it should be much more readable."
"The European Union is an edifice, a unique interaction between the supranational level and the Member States."
"It is also unique in that it is almost easier to say what the European Union is not, rather than what it is."
"It is something which exists much more in the eyes of the outside world than in the eyes of its own citizens."
"Making it clear what the Union is, and what it can and must become, is a task which faces all those involved in European integration, not just in the European institutions, but also in the national governments and parliaments."
"This, at least, is the view taken by the Dutch presidency."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your congratulations and for the statement that you have just made."
"I now give the floor to Mr van den Broek, on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, on behalf of President Santer and the whole of the Commission, I should like to add just a few words to the most interesting introduction given by Mr van Mierlo, on which I should like to congratulate him and his team."
"As you know, President Santer regrets that he is unable to be here this afternoon because he was required to attend Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"I shall be quite brief."
"On 7 January this year, the entire Commission visited The Hague to discuss the Dutch presidency's plans, and it was encouraging to learn from these intensive and very useful talks that we share just the same priorities."
"It is what you would expect, and is hardly surprising."
"We all realize that the Dutch presidency has a difficult job ahead of it over the next six months, since there are so many priorities, although there may be slightly more emphasis on the Intergovernmental Conference, from which we are expecting so much and which I have to say I confidently expect to be a success under the Dutch presidency."
"What is more, Dutch presidencies already have some experience of Intergovernmental Conferences, and I would point out that the birth of the Maastricht Treaty in 1991 was anything but a painless experience."
"The road to Amsterdam is also sure to be a bumpy one, but it will be worth it."
"As Mr van Mierlo has already said, the Dutch presidency is highly motivated, and we are firmly convinced that without a successful conclusion in June, Europe will be thrown into reverse instead of moving forward."
"Certainly, on the subject of enlargement, the Commission promises to have all the preparatory documents for the enlargement process ready by the middle of the year."
"These will include the recommendations on all ten applications for membership from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states and the report on the effects of enlargement on various policy areas, in particular the common agricultural policy and regional policy."
"It also means that a new financial framework will be proposed for the Union's finances after 1999, and a broad policy document will be put forward concerning the enlargement process itself, such as how to conduct the negotiations, what to do about the transitional periods, and so on."
"In short, the Commission also intends to do its share alongside the work of the presidency."
"This also applies, of course, for other major areas such as economic and monetary union and the Commission's contribution to the ongoing institutional debate at the Intergovernmental Conference, where we too recognize the importance of 'flexibility' - I support Mr van Mierlo's comments here."
"You can expect a paper from the Commission on this subject shortly."
"The word employment has been mentioned, and I was pleased to hear it."
"You know how determinedly President Santer and the Commission keep on stressing the added value of having policy convergence in this field."
"We intend to put forward more detailed proposals in Amsterdam, including an action plan to ensure greater freedom of movement in our common internal market."
"On the subject of foreign policy, we support the priorities that Mr van Mierlo described, though I agree with him that there are many more than he had time to mention."
"I should like to say a few words about the situation in Belgrade, in view of your motion for a resolution and the questions on the subject that have been addressed to the Commission."
"It goes without saying - and here too I agree with what Mr van Mierlo said - that the Union and the Commission insist that President Milosevic must carry out all the recommendations of the Gonz√°lez committee."
"It is also self-evident for the Commission that until this happens and until a number of other conditions from the Dayton Agreement have been met, there can be no question of any formal links between the European Union and Belgrade, any cooperation agreements or any technical aid or preferential trade for Belgrade. We have proposals on all these issues on ice, but the current political situation in Belgrade rules out any possibility of acting on them."
"I should like once again to congratulate Mr van Mierlo on his introduction and to assure him that he has the full support of President Santer and the entire Commission."
"We are looking forward to working closely with the presidency."
"Mr President, it is an honour and a pleasure for me to be able to welcome the Dutch presidency on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"My group has great expectations of the presidency, expectations which Mr van Mierlo's speech has just confirmed, and we have no doubts about the European-mindedness of either the Netherlands Government or yourself, Mr van Mierlo."
"But friends must be able to take criticism as well as praise, and there are a few critical comments I should like to make."
"First of all, greater attention needs to be given, as you are well aware, to bridging the gap between Europe and its citizens."
"The bureaucracy, the endless round of Council meetings and the obscure and incomprehensible deals are hardly likely to fire people with enthusiasm, either in the Netherlands or elsewhere."
"That is why we hope the Dutch presidency will promote greater openness, greater transparency in decision-making and more consultation, not least with the European Parliament."
"It is quite ridiculous that we sometimes have to go to Stockholm to find out what happened at a Council meeting."
"The Netherlands, with its tradition of open and democratic government, has a role to play here, and this also goes for the other problem area, the poor management of the Union's finances."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council must work together to ensure that resources are used carefully and correctly."
"We feel that the Dutch programme lacks specific proposals for improving controls, and indeed I have to say that it lacks specific proposals concerning the Members of Parliament themselves."
"We need a European statute for all MEPs."
"We have been calling for this for ten years now, and I think it is high time the Council did something about it."
"We hope the presidency will take steps to introduce the statute this year."
"Europe needs popular support, it needs people to believe in the European ideal again."
"We can achieve this by ensuring that the Union puts its own house in order, and by pursuing clear policies which produce practical, tangible results."
"We are naturally pleased with the presidency's plans in the field of employment, because we need more jobs in Europe."
"Unemployment stands at over 10 % in many Member States, and this naturally provokes activity from the trade unions."
"The idea that 'EMU equals unemployment' is probably wrong, but then so is the blind pursuit of monetarist objectives."
"More investment in people, pressing on with shorter working time, greater scope for time off to look after children or for further training or retraining - all these are already in the pipeline and are just waiting to be put into effect."
"Europe has its own role to play here, in addition to what the Member States are doing."
"Europe also needs a stronger Community policy on justice and home affairs, which is a prime example of the kind of area about which people are concerned."
"We are talking here about international crime, combating drugs and racism, and policies on fraud and asylum."
"At Maastricht, it was planned to bring the third pillar under the first, but I have the impression that the opposite has happened, because there is now more emphasis on the intergovernmental approach, which is not what was intended."
"So much for my criticisms."
"There are, however, some positive points that I should also like to make."
"We welcome what was said about environment policy, which is an area where we have a very robust agenda, for example in connection with development cooperation."
"We think it is wonderful that we are gradually adopting a coordinated, integrated approach to the environment and development cooperation."
"I shall not comment on what the Minister said about the IGC, because this is something we all support."
"We feel that Europe is out of kilter, and we need to do everything we can to restore the balance between north and south, not least financially, and between our own interests and international solidarity."
"We need to work for EMU, but also for employment, the environment and equal opportunities."
"Of course, we realize that the presidency is also keen to keep its balance and not to slip."
"But if a tightrope-walker loses his nerve and tries to stand still, he inevitably falls off."
"Mr van Mierlo, I wish you courage and inspiration on the rather slack rope in front of you, and I hope to be able to bring you the hearty congratulations of the Socialist Group when I meet you at the other end in June."
"Mr President, the founding father of my country - I am a firm believer in a Europe of nations - was the Prince of Orange from France, who was also the Count of Nassau in Germany."
"This was the first example of Franco-German cooperation, as it were, and it led to the birth of the Netherlands."
"When he was in difficulties, Willem van Oranje Nassau used to say in French: ' Il n'y a pas besoin d'esp√©rer pour entreprendre et ni de r√©ussir pour pers√©v√©rer ' ."
"You do not need to hope in order to try, or to succeed in order to persevere."
"I would just like to point this out to the Dutch President-in-Office, although the situation now is not as hopeless as it was in 1548."
"I should like to thank Mr van Mierlo for his philosophical and constructive speech."
"You may be primus inter pares for 14 Member States, but given that post-war European idealism has faded and the whole concept of Europe is gradually being eroded, you can no longer afford to hide behind terms such as flexibility and pragmatism."
"You are aware of this too."
"After the reunification of Germany, we are now on the threshold of further enlargement, and we have an historic opportunity to ensure that we become more than just an extended trade zone."
"Mr President-in-Office, how do you intend to use the same ambivalent policy which the Netherlands applies to drugs as a means of combating crime?"
"Your proposals for consolidation are not clear."
"Are you or are you not prepared to accept a rotating Benelux Commissioner?"
"How can you claim to be playing a useful role in the Middle East peace process when you have failed to do so up to now in Europe?"
"Once again, it is the United States which is supporting the Serbian opposition and which defused the minor missile crisis on Cyprus."
"How inconsistent it is to continue to support human rights violators such as Algeria and Syria, while allowing relations to cool with Turkey, towards which the Union has certain obligations and which deserves a high level of financial support."
"Is there any area where you are actually taking action under your putative foreign policy?"
"I cannot find any mention of one."
"Next, there is the democratic deficit."
"This does not lie with the European Parliament, but with you!"
"You are the one who is in charge of all this secretive legislation in Europe."
"However, we shall give you the benefit of the doubt, and ultimately we shall be judging you on the following points."
"Has the legislative activity of the main European legislator, the Council of Ministers, become as open as that of its fellow legislator, the European Parliament?"
"We do not need to amend the Treaty, simple rules of procedure would be quite enough."
"And has the social aspect of Europe been maintained by allowing workers a say in legislation?"
"Moving on to human rights, you criticize China, but it would make more sense to criticize Suriname."
"Can you tell us whether Bouterse had Dutch nationality at the time of the murders, and will you ensure that the mysteriously lost file on his nationality is made public?"
"This will help the cause of human rights and help to combat international drug trafficking."
"Are you maintaining your support for the hard euro, for instance?"
"What have you done to improve the governability of the Union before we proceed to enlargement?"
"These are the points we shall be judging you on at the end of the day."
"On behalf of the small delegation in the Union for Europe Group, I should like to wish the Dutch presidency every success, because this is what Europe needs and deserves, and we must all work together for its stability and security."
"I wish you every success, Mr van Mierlo."
"Mr President, I should like to focus on the central issue of European politics and leave Dutch domestic policy to the Tweede Kamer , which Mrs Maij-Weggen remembers so nostalgically."
"The European Union is entering the most important phase of its development since 1957."
"We are standing at a crossroads."
"Either Europe - north and south - has a single currency by 2002, or else we shall have wasted this opportunity for an entire generation."
"Either the Union incorporates the democracies of Eastern Europe, or else it will have failed in its most important task."
"Either it maintains the integrity of its institutions intact, or Germany's geopolitical importance will once again spawn resentment throughout the rest of Europe."
"All these issues have tended to make many national leaders afraid to give the Union the direction it needs, preferring all too often to fan the flames of nationalism by what they do or refuse to do."
"All too often, they are happy to blame Europe for unpopular decisions taken at national level, while they themselves take the praise for what the Union achieves."
"This is threatening to make the Union the focus of everyone's fears rather than their hopes, and it is a dangerous development."
"European integration is not irreversible."
"Nationalism is far more destructive and the Union far more fragile than many people realize."
"In this context, the main tasks facing the Union under the Dutch presidency are clear."
"Firstly, we need to ensure that the single currency is strong and stable from the outset and, secondly, the Union must be made more decisive and democratic in preparation for enlargement."
"Eleven countries are waiting to join, six in Central and Eastern Europe, three in the Baltic region and two in the Mediterranean."
"The more disparate the Union becomes, the more difficult it will be to take decisions."
"A Union with 18 to 26 members must therefore choose either to restrict the use of the veto or else to see itself become a miniature version of the OSCE."
"A Union which can no longer take decisions rapidly and decisively will soon become irrelevant in the eyes of its citizens and lose their support for good."
"Nothing is more damaging to the Union's credibility than its continual failure to speak with one voice in international politics, for which misuse of the veto is partly to blame."
"Portugal blocked an EU agreement with ASEAN, Spain an agreement with Canada, the United Kingdom opposed a common position on chemical weapons, and Greece blocked the Union's Mediterranean policy."
"The scope for blackmail in the Union's trade and foreign policies is simply far too great at the moment, and that is why the Treaty needs to be amended."
"Of course, amending the Treaty alone is not enough."
"The Member States also need to be prepared to share its common interests and principles."
"Nowhere is this more urgently needed than in former Yugoslavia."
"When will the Union finally take steps to make Belgrade and Zagreb hand over those suspected of war crimes?"
"Yes, the Union is making sympathetic noises about the conclusions reached in London, but none of it is very convincing or effective."
"I therefore call on the Dutch presidency to propose joint measures making all non-humanitarian aid to former Yugoslavia conditional on the handing-over of suspects to the tribunal in The Hague."
"The public also urgently needs a response from the Union to the rapidly growing problems of transfrontier crime and migration."
"I would also urge that measures be taken to tackle fraud head-on, that we should have better controls at our external borders, and that we should have a fair system for sharing the burden of looking after refugees."
"If decisive action is to be taken on each of these issues, the Member States must limit the paralysing effect of the veto."
"The Union must be able to take action where its citizens want it to, on urgent international problems."
"It is time that the Union finally carried out the promises made to its citizens in the Maastricht Treaty."
"National politicians must allow the Union to become more than just the sum of selfish national concerns."
"I hope that the Dutch presidency will be successful in achieving this."
"Mr President, I should like to open a parenthesis in this debate which so far has been exclusively in Dutch and introduce a few 'brushstrokes' with southern colours."
"As has already been mentioned, three major subjects are on the agenda which cross over in some cases in such a way that they are inextricably linked and should inevitably be included among the priorities of the Dutch presidency."
"I refer to the final phase of the IGC, the third phase of economic and monetary union and enlargement."
"There are other subjects, of course, which are particularly felt by the citizens of our countries and which also deserve to be concentrated upon."
"These include growing social problems and, in particular, the serious scourge of unemployment, citizen participation in Community life and decision making and whether or not to apply the principles of Community cohesion and solidarity which are enshrined in the Treaty."
"I should like to begin by saying, and this is no surprise, that it is my conviction that little or no progress has been made in this presidency concerning the last three aspects which I have just emphasized."
"Indeed, on a social level - and especially in the field of employment - there seem to be no changes of a major sort on the horizon, no significant changes, no basic changes concerning what have been Community policies until now."
"Given the obsession as to the application of nominal convergent criteria, there has been greater flexibility, greater deregulation, more precarious employment and more unemployment."
"Of course, we do appreciate the references made in the announcement on the programme of the Dutch presidency, such as achieving more equality between men and women."
"But, given the current social situation, this is not enough."
"New guidelines and, in our view, a farreaching change are vital."
"The same could be said about citizen participation, which must deal with the fact that citizens are increasingly ignored in Community life and decision making."
"At the eve of the end of the IGC and of the third stage of EMU, we would like to hope for a greater determination and an attempt to increase participation by European citizens, which would lead to a wider ranging, more pluralistic and involved discussion and would enable citizens to be listened to, thanks to referendums on all of these matters."
"As the European Parliament itself has already emphasized, after all."
"However, the Dutch presidency has also done little to advance this matter, limiting itself to the already known and limited expectations as to the outcome of the IGC and the intentions which we have definitely noted but which to us appear to be excessively vague."
"As to cohesion, here it is a complete vacuum, and not even a single word on this area."
"But this is quite symptomatic and revelatory of a certain conception of the European Community."
"Now I wish to come back to the three main subjects which I referred to at the beginning."
"In today's debate, we have already had the opportunity to assess the outcome of the Dublin Summit in two aspects, and we have to repeat that what we said then, in other words that we should refer to an aspect which to me seems to be of particular relevance and topicality, as far as EMU is concerned and the current presidency."
"This concerns the statement made by the current Dutch Finance Minister as to the select group of countries which, as has already been pointed out, should enter EMU at the beginning of the third phase, therefore giving priority to the levels of development or of buoyancy of the economies of those countries, switching to a subordinate level the respect or not of nominal convergence criteria."
"We are not surprised by this declaration."
"However, we hoped that it would come at some point in time, from this or that origin."
"Not only because we thought that those criteria were artificial and arbitrary in any way, but also because, primarily, the difficulties in fulfilling them are quite obvious even on the part of countries with the stronger economies! - and secondly because the real aim is the creation of a strong currency and, in the end, we always suspected that the final decisions in this area would be - or will be, finally adopted according to markedly political criteria."
"However, and here I am concluding, all of this calls for the new presidency to clarify thoroughly and objectively what they are really proposing in this area."
"And that is what I am asking for now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here is another non-Dutch person taking the floor."
"It is a pleasant custom to wish each other all the best at the start of the year, and I wish the Dutch presidency great courage in dealing with the difficult problems that are sure to land in its lap over the next few months."
"In its programme, the Netherlands says that it feels fortunate to have inherited the draft of the new treaty from Ireland, but a clear majority here in Parliament has already pointed out that it is not so happy with the Irish presidency's proposals for the treaty, and for one crucial reason, which is that little attention is given to the issue of democratization."
"In particular, as Mr Brok explained this morning, there is a very real danger that the further expansion of the Union will lead to fewer powers for Parliament, which would simply be the final straw."
"It is quite ridiculous to be launching campaigns to bring Europe closer to its citizens, while at the same time leaving the elected representatives of those citizens out in the cold."
"On the contrary, we need to put their representatives in a stronger position, and I think the exposure of the BSE scandal by our Committee of Inquiry here in the House has been convincing proof that elected representatives are irreplaceable when it comes to safeguarding the interests of the people and public health."
"We know from experience that the Commission and the Council are far too easily swayed by lobby groups or the governments of certain Member States."
"So I think Parliament must be able to prove that it can safeguard these important interests, and this is also why we want Parliament to have codecision rights on agricultural matters."
"As regards the proposals on the internal market, I feel it is a little too ingenuous to claim that they are the safest way to guarantee growth and employment."
"What sort of growth?"
"Growth with more pollution and less concern about jobs?"
"It is clear that the internal market has not scored well on creating employment over the last few years, and I would point out that there is increasing evidence of conflict between sound environmental regulations in the Member States and free competition on the internal market."
"When Germany proposes tax breaks to promote environmentally-friendly energy, these are dismissed as distorting competition, and countries which try to internalize environmental costs are attacked, while others which externalize such costs do indeed distort competition."
"We cannot have any sustainable development based on practices of this kind, which are on the increase in the internal market."
"The employment initiatives announced are extremely disappointing."
"Yet again they simply refer everything to the ECOFIN, which has proved over the last few years to be more of a stumbling-block than a stimulus."
"We have taken measures to oppose this, with a number of our colleagues."
"I should like to conclude by saying that when you ask yourself, Mr van Mierlo, whether a European edifice can fire people with enthusiasm, the answer is that it will generate some enthusiasm if Europe presents itself as an emancipating political project designed to deal with an incomprehensible and uncontrolled world market."
"Instead, though, the Union often presents itself as subservient to the world market."
"I would urge the Dutch presidency to be more active on human rights and external relations."
"The Netherlands does not have the greatest reputation in this area, preferring to leave it up to the Union to take initiatives on human rights."
"But you are now in the driving seat for Europe, so do something about it this time, and put pressure on President Milosevic to recognize all the election results in his country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following Mr Miranda's example, I too should like to contribute in a different language to this debate, which has largely been conducted in Dutch, and to say how delighted I am that the Netherlands is holding the presidency for these next six months."
"As a member of the transnational Radical Party, I cannot forget that it was a Dutchman, Mr Bos, who chaired the preparatory committee at the UN which - thanks also to the European Union's help and support - led to that organization setting 1998 as the date for the International Criminal Court to be established."
"This is proof indeed that, given the necessary political backing, small steps can be taken in the right direction; and I now hope that other such steps will be taken during the course of the Dutch presidency."
"The challenges lying ahead of us, and ahead of you, are naturally enormous, and I think they will be crucial for the future of the European Union."
"1997 is clearly a key year for economic and monetary union; let us therefore hope that the Dutch presidency will take to heart the increasingly widespread idea that, alongside the necessary and proper route towards the single currency, some political thinking should be devoted to its much-needed counterpart - economic management - so that convergence will not merely be monetary, but will really bring about the kind of economic management that was called for by Jacques Delors, without which the day the single currency comes into being could also be the day that sees European public opinion becoming ever more disaffected with Europe and with the European Union, on which we have to rely if we are to meet the international challenges facing us."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs has prepared an excellent document for the IGC, which I hope Parliament will adopt tomorrow. I hope that the Dutch presidency will regard it as a valuable contribution in bringing to a successful conclusion the work started under the Irish presidency."
"With regard to the challenges which await us in the field of foreign and security policy, I do of course understand the possible limitations, but I believe that with a resolute government at the helm, some important matters can be taken forward: for example, floating the idea of a moratorium on the death penalty, or taking action on China - not giving in, as I hope you will not, to the veto which Italy and France are brandishing to prevent you from putting down a motion on China in the Geneva Commission on Human Rights."
"You have our best wishes, then; you will have Parliament behind you, and yours will be small steps in the right direction."
"Mr President, the greatest challenge facing the Dutch presidency is undoubtedly the conclusion of the IGC."
"Institutional reform is needed to make the Union capable of accommodating 25 or more Member States."
"Ireland's general draft for the reform of the Treaty does no more than list the problems here, so there are still hurdles to be overcome."
"It has now become clear that the reforms will relate primarily to the further consolidation of European integration, in other words more powers for Europe and the further centralization of decision-making at European level."
"This seems an obvious development from the point of view of achieving a particular concept of the Union's future structure."
"However, we must not overlook the negative aspects associated with this, particularly the ever-widening gap between European government and its citizens."
"I would therefore urge the Dutch presidency to give particular attention to two issues arising from this disturbing and unwelcome side-effect of centralization."
"The Irish proposals provide a useful platform here."
"Firstly, there is the proposal that a protocol should be attached to the Treaty defining how the principle of subsidiarity is to be applied."
"At the Edinburgh summit at the end of 1992, certain clear statements were made about this principle in response to Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, but they were unfortunately not taken up by the European Parliament, nor have they been included in the Irish draft."
"However, applying the statements made at Edinburgh could do much to reduce the quantity and detail of European legislation, which will be necessary if a Union with 25 or more increasingly disparate Member States is to remain manageable."
"In this context, the Dutch presidency must not hesitate to give back to the Member States, if necessary, certain responsibilities which have been transferred to the Union."
"A second useful proposal in the Irish draft is to strengthen the position of the national parliaments in the administration of Europe."
"A great deal is made of the democratic deficit in discussions of democratic controls on European decision-making, and it is generally felt that the answer to the problem lies in giving the European Parliament greater powers."
"However, we must not forget that the national parliaments form the basis for parliamentary democracy in Europe, and this is how the public sees the situation."
"We therefore also support the proposals to involve the national parliaments in the European decision-making process, for example by sending them early drafts of proposals for European legislation."
"It would seem that flexibility is going to be the most serious obstacle in the negotiations over the next few months."
"It was proposed as a way of preventing those countries which refuse any further transfer of sovereignty from standing in the way of the group of countries which are prepared to allow it."
"We are not exactly taken with this idea, which is likely to undermine cooperation and make decision-making in the Union more difficult."
"We feel it would be better to restrict cooperation at EU level to areas of policy associated with the internal market."
"Countries which wish to have more extensive cooperation in fields such as foreign policy and justice can reach agreements on such matters outside the Treaty."
"Finally, we hope that the Dutch presidency will manage to bring the IGC to a successful conclusion, but we feel that the quality of the results is more important than keeping to a self-imposed timetable."
"I wish the Dutch presidency great physical and mental resilience in its work."
"Mr President-in-Office, in your statement you mentioned a number of commendable programmes and projects, which are worthy of support; we should not, however, like to see what has happened with other presidencies, when issues have remained pending indefinitely and some problems have slipped out of sight, only to swell the workload of subsequent presidencies."
"The Alleanza Nazionale regards the coming months as crucial, since the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference will provide once and for all the key to understanding what form the EU of the future will take: in other words, whether it will be what is often called a European Union '√† la carte' , from which each country can take what attracts it most, without feeling bound by commitments which do not suit it; or a Europe with a single market and a single currency, where the financial and monetary policies of the individual countries are determined by the European Central Bank and, within that, by a small group of bankers belonging to the so-called Deutschmark zone; or else a Union enlarged to include the Eastern European countries, and therefore - unless the rules are changed - ' unravelled' and in the grip of severe social and employment-related problems, which would then absorb its attention to the detriment of initiatives in other sectors; or again, as the Alleanza Nazionale hopes, a Europe which, above and beyond economic and financial cohesion, will at long last speak with a single voice on foreign and security policy issues, a Europe which sees the problems of the Mediterranean region as vital to its interests and to its very existence - not least the problem of the population explosion in the countries which face us on the North African coast, and the consequent illegal immigration of desperate people in search of work and a livelihood."
"The Dutch presidency could make a major contribution on these and other issues, even though certain statements from you and from the governor of the Dutch Bank lead me to believe that attention is more likely to be focused on the achievement of the single currency and compliance with the Maastricht criteria."
"Despite the fact that my party is in opposition in Italy, I would also point out that the efforts being made by the Italian Government to comply with the commitments entered into at Maastricht - of which we in the Alleanza Nazionale are highly critical - deserve respect from everyone: no one has a right to judge them with arrogance or with an air of superiority."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"Mr President, the Netherlands presidency has a great responsibility on its shoulders."
"Europe is at a critical moment in its development with two monumental challenges looming on the horizon."
"Firstly, of course, there is a move towards the final stage of economic and monetary union but there is also, just as crucially, the enlargement of the European Union towards the Mediterranean and in Central and Eastern Europe."
"As we all know, the accession negotiations will not begin until after the Intergovernmental Conference has concluded and after the Dutch presidency."
"But if the eventual negotiations are to be successful, the preparatory work has to be undertaken during the next six months."
"Rather than the somewhat vacuous exchanges of the past, there must be a real effort now at constructive dialogue."
"A number of important issues must be raised - issues which range from aspects of the internal market to the development in Eastern Europe of civil society in all its complexities."
"In this context, too, let us also focus our attention on the reforms of the European Union, reforms which will be necessary to allow enlargement to come about."
"In this House we all realize the need for institutional changes but let us not forget that our budgetary structures, particularly the structural funds and the common agricultural policy, will have to be fundamentally reformed."
"Without these changes enlargement simply will not come about."
"Over the next few years, alongside EMU, enlargement of the Union must be at the very top of our agenda."
"Enlargement is not a question of if, but of when and of how."
"Enlargement is in the interests of both the European Union and the applicant states."
"It is in the interests of the Union because it will give us a larger market and will help secure peace and stability."
"It is in the interests of the applicants because the Union can help them achieve economic prosperity and political progress."
"I wish to emphasize that all of us, together as Europeans, have a moral responsibility to work with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe so that they can overcome the legacy of the past forty-odd years."
"The environmental degradation, the gross economic mismanagement and the stifling of any truly democratic impulses are all aspects of that legacy."
"In partnership with the people of Eastern Europe we must overcome those aspects conclusively."
"Together we have to build a new and united Europe - a Europe which includes East as well as West."
"To a large extent the speed at which enlargement will take place and the extent to which the huge problems will be overcome will depend on the preparatory work of the Dutch presidency."
"I hope that essential preparation will take place, and I am sure it will."
"Madam President, I also wish to express my best wishes to the Dutch presidency."
"In my view, what we should be expecting from this presidency is not that it should manage to resolve all the problems currently facing the European Union - something which would be physically impossible, for reasons of time - but that, by shaping wills and achieving consensus, it should be capable of giving a boost to the process of European integration, which is now at a critical point in its timetable."
"And, precisely because it is at a critical point in its timetable, I believe that the Dutch presidency must proceed with a large measure of prudence, skill and tact."
"I wish to tell you, therefore, Mr President-in-Office, that the remarks of your colleague, the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, who quite improperly referred to the hysteria of certain Member States in wishing to join the monetary union, were hard to understand."
"It is not, in my view, the task of the Council presidency to pass judgement on the capabilities of the Member States; nor is it helpful to undermine a consensus unnecessarily, especially in respect of issues on which the Treaty can be the only judge."
"In all fairness, however, it has to be said that the President-in-Office clarified matters in his speech this afternoon."
"What we are assessing today are the Dutch presidency's priorities and goals."
"In this context, I should like to ask the President-in-Office two questions."
"Firstly, has the Dutch presidency scheduled for the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in April an initial analysis of the revision of the financial perspectives, with a view to the future financing of the Community?"
"Secondly, has the Dutch presidency provided for the possibility of the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference on the reform of the Treaties being adopted by only 14 Member States? And, on the basis of its contacts with the present British Government, has it formulated any initiative for breaking the deadlock to which an outcome of this kind would give rise?"
"I shall end, Madam President, as I began: by expressing my best wishes for success to the Dutch presidency, and reminding the President-in-Office that the challenge for the presidency - which, as he rightly said at the beginning of his speech, is in a way the challenge for the European Union as a whole - is to reconcile unity and diversity, using prudence, skill and tact, to make compatible the legitimate interests of the individual Member States, including those of the Netherlands, and to forge the European Union into a harmonious whole."
"And to that end, Mr President-in-Office, our group advocates two principles: for ideas to be placed at the service of ideals whenever necessary; and for the individual Member States to seek their advantage in advantages for all."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I too endorse the positive assessments of the prospects which you have outlined in respect of the IGC, monetary union, enlargement and, in particular, the strengthening of dialogue."
"Within this positive context, however, there is a major source of regret, and I am sorry to have to strike a negative tone here: there is a risk that the European Union could take a distinct step backwards in sectors which affect its political, social and economic life, the internal market in particular, trade policy and the wretched problem of employment which we are trying so hard to combat."
"Your programme does not devote a single word to tourism, which even in the past has been a marginal issue in the EU, a kind of foreign body in the Community organism."
"Well, tourism is now dead - or rather, it has been killed off, murdered by the Council of Ministers in the middle of last month."
"Its demise was announced in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I think will just be called the Committee on Transport from now on, to the dismay of all those who have spent years working on two projects."
"The first of these was a tentative project entitled 'Community actions in favour of tourism' , which came to fruition in 1994; it was a modest affair with appropriations of just ECU 6 million."
"If you consider that my region in the Alps, with only 450 000 inhabitants, earmarks ECU 1 m more than what the Union as a whole was allocating, you will realize just how vital it is to pay attention to tourism."
"That action, however, made reference to tourism after the year 2000, so the new child has died in the cradle!"
"Tourism is referred to in the Treaty on European Union, where it is described as a fundamental sector of activity."
"The figures speak for themselves: 9.5 million workers, meaning just as many families, 65 % female employment, 296 million visitors every year within Europe, and revenue of USD 165 000 m, which is over 5 % of European GDP."
"Evidently all of this carries no weight."
"Tourism, as I said, has been killed off."
"But it is not the tourism of Venice, Paris, Madrid or Amsterdam: that is constant, inevitable and guaranteed."
"It is the tourism of depressed and outlying regions, where tourism enables people to eke out a living and, in many cases, is the only economic resource."
"And it is this kind of tourism that I wish to raise with you, tourism which meets important needs as an instrument of cohesion - a word which is on all of our lips - as an opportunity to meet others, an incentive to safeguard and enhance our cultural, historical and artistic heritage."
"Moreover, this form of tourism stimulates other sectors: transport, trade and agriculture."
"And we sit here discussing - it has really happened - what becomes of juveniles in fish farms producing bass, or the percentage of cocoa in chocolate."
"So please, Mr President-in-Office, listen to the 12 countries which said yes to tourism, and not the three which, through that absurd mechanism, unanimity, said no."
"Madam President, unlike my colleague and fellow countryman, Mr Salafranca, I understood perfectly well the remarks made by the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, the Dutch Finance Minister, which the Dutch Prime Minister naturally tried to cover up with diplomatic words."
"He reminded us what economic and monetary union actually means and, further still, how it is interpreted by what might be called the Union's economically and financially strongest Member States."
"He informed us that economic and monetary union will mean a two-speed Europe and, moreover, that the strong countries are wondering whether a number of the weaker countries will be suitable for that two-speed Europe."
"In other words, he told us what the President of the Bundesbank and other monetary and government officials in the Europe of the hard core might really be thinking."
"I understood the message perfectly well, therefore."
"And I believe that a great many Spaniards, Italians, Greeks and other Europeans will have understood perfectly well what sort of future awaits them in this kind of economic and monetary union."
"Consequently, diplomatic words can do little to mask something that was said not speaking from the heart, but thinking of the wallet, and I say this as someone who certainly does not support the ill-fated chapter of the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union."
"I have devoted most of my speaking time to referring to a matter that I did not intend to address, and now I cannot fail to say two things."
"We are also debating the situation in Serbia."
"I believe that Parliament must call on the Dutch presidency to demand that President Milosevic recognize the results of the municipal elections of 17 November in their entirety."
"However, we should not forget that another former Yugoslav republic has also been having problems - not least in joining the Council of Europe - because democracy is lacking: I refer to Croatia."
"Everyone must be judged by the same standards."
"I shall end by pointing out that, as a Spaniard, I was disappointed to find that the programme of the Dutch presidency fails to mention the development of relations with Cuba."
"I am not sure if this is because, just a few days ago, President Clinton thanked the Union for the position that it has adopted - in exchange, of course, for suspending application of, but not annulling, the unacceptable Helms-Burton Act."
"Madam President, Mr van Mierlo and Mr Patijn, your colleague Mr Kok said yesterday that it would be better for politicians to keep quiet about EMU, but I can promise you that I have no intention of doing so."
"It would be a very bad thing for democracy in Europe if we did not talk about a subject which is causing people increasing concern."
"And rightly so, since EMU in its present form will simply lead to social disintegration."
"It applies a budgetary strait-jacket, but offers no measures to combat fiscal competition."
"Much is said about employment, but no instruments are provided for it."
"In the race for the euro, the Member States are leaving 20 million unemployed people in the lurch."
"The single currency is bound to lead to division and discord."
"The southern countries are afraid of missing the EMU boat, and Mr Zalm, as someone has already pointed out, called their fears hysterical."
"He was being much too candid."
"My friends in the south, if only you knew how the Netherlands talks about your plans to join the EMU."
"They would much rather see you outside it than profiting from it."
"Everything has to be sacrificed for the hard euro, even the Amsterdam treaty if necessary."
"Mr Kok knows very well that quarrels about EMU are a real obstacle to the reform of the Treaty, while further political integration is needed before there can be monetary integration."
"A monetary union which is not also a social and ecological union and which does not create jobs could well fall victim to divisions between the governments and suspicion from the public, so as far as I am concerned, EMU can stay on hold until we have a better treaty which makes the Union more democratic and decisive, a hard enough task in itself."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what can we hope for at the outset of the Dutch presidency?"
"Bearing in mind the extremely, and increasingly, restrictive aspects of the Treaty, in what ways can we hope to shape the future of Europe?"
"First, on the economic and financial front, the Dutch presidency is going to have to negotiate the single European market, and in this area it will certainly be much preoccupied by a great many monetary questions that dictate the future of the famous single currency."
"What we hope is that European prosperity, employment and what remains of free enterprise in Europe are not going to be sacrificed on the altar of monetary stability, and that the situations of our various currencies are not going to be inflicted with new forms of monetary discipline that will prevent the necessary adjustments from being made."
"The Dutch presidency, so we hear, will also be active in the Middle East peace process."
"What we must hope for here - and it certainly won't be easy - is that Europe will speak with a voice that is not the voice of the United States of America."
"Our interests are not the same and we have a different part to play."
"As far as organized crime is concerned, it will undoubtedly be necessary to review certain unwise provisions regarding the opening of frontiers, both inside and outside the Union."
"As for enlargement, we hope the European presidency will carefully consider the dangers represented by allowing the accession of a country which, sadly, has recently been split in two by an inexplicable war."
"Madam President, clearly and briefly, with a legal basis enshrined in the Treaties, the Dutch presidency is defining its programme text with rigorous challenges forced upon us by the way in which we are moving towards the introduction of the euro."
"Normally very few people read - or if they do so they do it without special attention - the promises included in presidencies' working programmes."
"But this time, in our view, these texts are taking on greater importance because they include the political, public and universal promises of the Dutch presidency and also because they are contradicting the recent declarations by the Dutch Finance Minister, Gerrit Zalm, who, with no or with very little restraint, condemned the southern European countries to ostracism as far as the single currency is concerned."
"Among other things he said two very serious things: the first was that he did not think it would be advantageous for the southern countries, where the sun shines in winter, to be included at the beginning in the first wave of countries joining the single currency, and secondly that he thought that there was a hysteria - climatic of course, I imagine - in the efforts made by those States to fulfil the convergence criteria."
"The President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council cannot talk rubbish of that kind."
"First of all, because only on the basis of the Treaty and the rigorous fulfilment of the criteria which Community law imposes can we define who will enter in the first wave or not."
"We are all equal when it comes to these matters and there are not States which are more equal than others."
"It is one thing for the Dutch Minister to express his opinion without an objective basis or a legal basis on a very sensitive subject concerning relations between Member States about the subject of non-existence Community norms."
"Secondly, it was offensive vis-√†-vis the efforts made by governments, citizens and countries which believe in a European compromise and are doing everything to fulfil the belt-tightening policies which are called for."
"As any average person in charge of European affairs acknowledges, these policies are a vital contribution to the strengthening of European public finances, fighting unemployment and making the projects for a single currency credible vis-√†-vis the US dollar or the Japanese yen."
"I have taken note of the declarations made at the beginning of the presentation of the working programme and in this debate and I welcome them, just as I also recalled the comments made by the Dutch Prime Minister, someone for whom I have utter respect and consideration, Mr Wim Kok, who said that he thought that those declarations were a gaffe."
"In fact, Mr Gerrit Zalm will need months if not years, certainly longer than the duration of this presidency, to understand the Treaty on European Union, to study the Maastricht criteria, to read the forecasts of independent bodies such as the OECD, for example, in order to conclude that at least in the case of my country, Portugal, we are just as ready as the Netherlands when it comes to most of the Maastricht criteria and far better than the Netherlands when it comes to public debt."
"It is exactly for this reason that we think that the Netherlands is fully entitled, once they fulfil those criteria, to join along with us, Spain and Italy, the first wave of countries joining the single currency."
"It is my desire, a desire which I make formally to the Dutch presidency and which in the end everything will be done so that the project to create a single currency will be a project covering the largest number of European citizens possible, based on requirements of rigour, but also based on the principle of equality among all the States in the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, I am speaking only on the subject of Serbia."
"I welcome the Council's decision of 9 January, calling on the Serbian Government to respect in full the results of the local elections in Serbia - in other words the victory of Zajedno, the alliance of opposition parties - to grant freedom of the press, to stop putting the independent media under pressure and to promote dialogue among all Serbia's political groups."
"After one foreign minister of this European Union brought the whole of the EU's foreign policy into disrepute through his unnecessary trip to Belgrade before Christmas, coupled with his imprudent remarks there, my own visit to Belgrade last week was made very straightforward by the Council's statement of 9 January."
"The opposition alliance Zajedno, the students and also hundreds of thousands of Serbian citizens have been coming out onto the streets for several weeks now."
"If our foreign ministers had experienced for themselves this atmosphere of a country reawakening, as I did last Thursday night, they would probably offer even more support for this democratic revival and also threaten - and actually impose - more stringent sanctions on Milosevic and his government."
"All those who think that we know where we stand with Milosevic, but not with the opposition, should pause for a moment and consider this idea."
"Is someone who brutally suppressed a democratic demonstration in his own country in 1991, who ordered the attack on Slovenia and the war against Croatia, with the first mass graves in Vukovar, who bears the original responsibility for the war in Bosnia, with its concentration camps, mass graves and displaced persons, who was labelled the butcher of the Balkans by the US diplomatic service in 1992 - is such a person more credible, is he better suited to establishing democracy in Serbia, than the opposition leaders whom he has sought to deprive of their electoral success?"
"However questionable the political stance of the two male leaders of the opposition alliance may have been in recent years - as I have said here before - the last few weeks have shown that they wish to give Serbia a new democratic face, through peaceful means and with the support of the civilian population."
"I am expecting the West to put at least as much trust in them as in Milosevic, if not more, since they have joined in an alliance with Mrs Pesic, leader of the Civil Alliance, who has campaigned from the outset against war in the region."
"I am also expecting the European Union to urge Milosevic, or indeed anyone else who comes to power, to solve the problem of Kosovo at long last, because that is where it all began and that is no doubt where it will end!"
"Milosevic is no longer the sole guarantor of the implementation of Dayton."
"Responsibility for ensuring that now lies in Sarajevo, Pale and Banja Luka, and those in authority there must be called to account: they must be regarded as our partners in dialogue."
"And everything would be much simpler if Karadzic were at last put where he belongs."
"During my days and nights in Belgrade, I sensed that the people there wish to be released at last from the stifling atmosphere and the repression of the Milosevic regime."
"Commissioner van den Broek, I hope that the European Union will in particular help the independent media - and especially Radio 92, which is playing a leading role - to facilitate this democratic process."
"It was at the time of the last Dutch presidency, and of Foreign Minister van den Broek, that the war in former Yugoslavia began."
"Please, Mr President-in-Office, do everything in your power to smooth Serbia's road to Europe, and also to bring real peace to Bosnia."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, the six-month period of the Dutch presidency is beginning at a crucial period for the European Union, as it faces the dual challenge of enlargement and intensification."
"Against the background of the intergovernmental conference, it is important not to lose sight of the objective we must pursue: alongside a monetary Europe we must have a citizens' Europe, a Union which satisfies the concerns and aspirations of its people."
"A citizens' Europe is a Europe which concerns itself with the weak, the needy, the excluded, its children and young people."
"That, Mr President-in-Office, is why I have been paying careful attention to your proposals on employment and social policy."
"The priority must be to create economic conditions favourable to the development of the job market."
"At the same time, it is essential to protect and develop the European social model, as a creator of wealth for our societies and economies."
"In this context, the intergovernmental conference will bear the heavy responsibility for providing the Union, at long last, with unchallengeable social powers, enabling it, in particular, to take more effective action in the campaign against social exclusion."
"Thinking of the ravages caused by drug addiction among our young people, in terms of dependence, poverty and health, I am also glad to see that the Dutch presidency has made it one of its priorities to combat international organized crime and drug trafficking."
"Practical cooperation between the police, customs and justice authorities of our Member States is essential if we are to conduct an active campaign against the drug trade, but - as the President-in-Office is aware - it is equally essential to harmonize national legislation on the penalties for drug dealing and use, because in the absence of such harmonization there can be no effective action and no safety for any of our fellow citizens, and especially for the young."
"My final point in this connection is to call upon the Dutch presidency not to neglect the grave problem of the protection of Europe's children - a problem which is not just a reflection of our concern at recent events but an absolutely fundamental issue for a united Europe."
"Once again, I take this opportunity to call upon the President-in-Office to set up a European centre for the prevention and combating of violence against minors."
"Such a centre, based on the model of the European agencies, would act as an authority for coordinating activities, but would also be a unique information exchange, which would be entrusted with the very specific priority mission of tracing missing children, by networking the national search centres and the schemes set up by associations and families in our various countries."
"In the course of the vote on the 1997 budget, Parliament and the Council demonstrated their support for the implementation of schemes to protect children."
"That determination must be translated into specific action, and I call upon the Council presidency to generate the necessary determination for the implementation of this project, so that the 80 million children living in the European Union can grow up in a Europe that welcomes them and is, of course, prepared for a better future."
"Madam President, I would like to wish the Dutch presidency success during the coming six months."
"The Netherlands are not one of the larger countries, but a country that is dynamic and could make a positive contribution, I would say, which might be rather different from and much more social than anything we have seen since the Maastricht Treaty, and one that is much more acceptable to Europe's citizens."
"We have noted sensitivity on the part of the Dutch presidency concerning a series of issues related to citizens' rights."
"Over some issues, however, we have seen a complete lack of sensitivity and we are hearing the Dutch presidency's programme here in Strasbourg, in Strasbourg where European Parliament Plenaries have repeatedly raised extremely serious issues concerning human rights violations by Turkey and where the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has in recent months proclaimed two decisions condemning Turkey, both in relation to the human rights of Kurds and in relation to the assets of Cypriots in areas of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish troops."
"From that standpoint, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you: You have been President-in-Office of the European Union for just a few weeks."
"Yesterday, after an escalation of threats, we heard Turkey's Islamic Prime Minister, Mr Erbakan, openly threatening war and territorial occupation against a Member State of the European Union, namely Greece, and against a country associated with the European Union, namely Cyprus."
"To be specific, Mr Erbakan said: ' Greece has learned the lessons of 1922 when the Greeks were expelled from Asia Minor and 1974 when half of Cyprus was occupied, and Turkey is ready to repeat those lessons' ."
"He is threatening war against a Member State of the European Union, and in the face of this threat of war we hear neither any protest nor any serious statement of attitude from the presidency."
"The only things we see and hear from you are diplomatic circumlocutions of no importance, which merely prepare the way for the convocation of the EU - Turkey Council of Association."
"Nobody wants Turkey to be isolated."
"Nobody wants walls between Turkey and Europe."
"But Turkey must respect the Member States, respect the European Union's democratic principles like any other country, and what we want from the presidency is to have the courage, the guts to live up to its responsibilities and support Member States threatened by such warlike proclamations."
"I expect an answer from you, Mr President-inOffice."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, the Dutch have sometimes been criticized in recent weeks for a lack of ambition in planning their presidency."
"It could also be said, however, that their agenda is very challenging."
"As Mr van den Broek has pointed out, pursuing simultaneously the aims of deepening and broadening the Union certainly requires a great deal of thought and effort."
"I should like to know, Mr President-in-Office, if you are clear about the preconditions for enlargement."
"Some of these have already been referred to: I am thinking of the institutional preconditions."
"As someone who comes from a small country, I support you in your efforts to ensure that in future, even in an enlarged Union, the small countries should have a sufficiently strong representation."
"With regard to regional aid, what ideas will the Netherlands feed into this debate, and will they shape regional aid in such a way that it is still workable in an enlarged Union?"
"On assistance for agriculture, are you prepared to support a shift away from a policy of direct subsidies towards one of aid for rural areas, taking particular account of social factors?"
"An area which is rarely mentioned, but where I would expect the necessary support from the Netherlands in particular, is environmental policy and the modernizing of nuclear power stations in the eastern half of Europe."
"I fully support your efforts to find a real solution here, but I believe that this will depend on many elements being put in place."
"Secondly, I would mention briefly something which is very important in the context of disarmament and war."
"It is to be hoped that, with the support of the Dutch presidency, we shall achieve something which lies within reach: a permanent ban on production, trade in and laying of anti-personnel mines, as well as the destruction of all antipersonnel mines which now exist."
"I would end by asking that, in respect of this important activity - currently being undertaken in the context of the United Nations, but where Europe must now show its true colours - the European Union should wage a successful campaign for the banning of anti-personnel mines, and I hope that you will be able to achieve this before the end of your presidency."
"Madam President, over the next few months, Europe is going to be put to the test."
"Will the Union be able to reform itself so that it can face the 21st century with confidence - a new era with a series of enlargements and all the problems of integration they will entail?"
"Some of the reforms needed to adapt our administrative and democratic structure to the new situation could present difficulties for individual Member States."
"The Netherlands has the considerable task of achieving consensus on this very difficult choice, but then consensus is something the Netherlands has always specialized in."
"Some people say that this is precisely why the polder economy has been such a success."
"The very fact that the Netherlands is accustomed to trying to reach compromises and consensus could make this Dutch presidency an historic one."
"But it certainly struck the wrong note in the very first week of the presidency - and I think Mr Salafranca was extremely tactful in how he referred to this, for which I am grateful to him - for a finance minister to express his views so outspokenly and undiplomatically that we can only fear that consensus and confidence will now be very hard to find."
"Even a child could tell which countries Mr Zalm was calling hysterical."
"A country like Spain, which has just frozen its civil service salaries so as to be able to meet the EMU criteria, will find it very difficult to defend its actions to its people if the EU President-in-Office calls its government hysterical."
"On behalf of my group, I must therefore ask the Dutch President-in-Office to explain his behaviour."
"The single currency will also require a great deal of work from the Dutch presidency."
"The regulations on the legal status of the euro, the finishing touches to the stability pact and a decision on a new European Monetary System are all matters which call for confidence and unanimity."
"But even where the single currency has most support in the Union, there are still a number of concerns, and the Dutch presidency is perhaps particularly well equipped to deal with these problems."
"Moving on to labour market policy and unemployment in the Union, the Netherlands is right to stress the need for structural changes in policy regarding rigid wage systems, changes in social benefits and greater labour mobility."
"One thing I would criticize in the programme of the Dutch presidency is the lack of any mention of a Tourism Council."
"People will eventually come to appreciate that tourism is the largest employer in the whole of the Union."
"Given that both the Union and the Netherlands Government feel so strongly about 'work, work, work' , it is all the more incomprehensible that the Dutch presidency seems to ignore the very existence of tourism."
"To conclude, I very much hope that the Dutch presidency is going to give us a people-friendly Amsterdam treaty that is just as creative as the city itself."
"Madam President, like other Members I would like to wish the Dutch presidency the very best of luck in a very important year for the European Union."
"The work undertaken by the Irish presidency has already established many of the yardsticks we need to follow."
"Judging by what was said in Parliament this morning in reply to the last President-in-Office, Prime Minister John Bruton, one can see that the emphasis is on a Europe which is closer to the people, which can take account of the people's concerns, can react quickly and assuage fears but which, at the same time, can stir enthusiasm and passion in people."
"So rather than repeat what has been said by other speakers, I just want to mention to the Dutch presidency two points on which I would like to see some action."
"One has already been mentioned in the presidency document which has been given to Members: it is the fight against international crime and illicit drug-trafficking."
"This is one of the biggest areas of concern to the ordinary man or woman in the street who is the embodiment of the European Union."
"A programme on BBC World Television last Monday night emphasized the point again that 82 % of all crime in Britain is drugs-related."
"Recent figures from the Irish Police Force say that 76 % of all crime in Ireland is drugsrelated."
"With the Europol drugs unit based in Holland, I hope the Dutch presidency will continue the work started by the Irish presidency in bringing forward coordinated and concerted action, moving these issues from the third pillar to the first pillar and getting more and more coordination and more and more cooperation between the Member States in tackling what is an evil and vile illicit business."
"Following on from that, my second and final point is that if this European Union is to mean anything, if the new treaty on European Union is to mean anything, it must protect those who are most vulnerable in our society, and that is our children."
"We have the ongoing case in Belgium of the paedophile rings."
"We have the ongoing everyday problems that children are facing not only with regard to sexual and emotional abuse but poverty, lack of opportunity and protection."
"With the amount of goodwill present, there should now be an opportunity for a specific article in the new treaty which the Dutch Government will - we hope - be bringing in under its presidency, to ensure that the rights and freedoms of children are fully and individually enshrined therein."
"If we cannot protect our future which is our children, what point is there in protecting the present?"
"Madam President, the Dutch presidency is charged with the duty that stems from previous Summits and most recently the Dublin Summit, to further the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference, the third phase of EMU, and the European Union's enlargement towards the Central and Eastern European Countries."
"What is certain is that by acting accordingly, the Dutch presidency will make its own contribution to the edifice of a Europe of poverty and unemployment."
"The peoples of Europe can expect no improvement of their living standards and working conditions from the activities of the next six months."
"Concerning the situation in Serbia, I would first like to comment on the cautious way in which the President-inOffice approached the issue in his statement."
"Madam President, despite the tremendous difficulties it is facing, both economically due to the embargo and because of the problems created by the embattled situation in the Balkan area, the Serbian nation is in a position to establish democratic procedures and extend its democratic rights if it is left free from outside pressures and international ulterior motives."
"The Serbian Government's decision to declare the municipal elections void and the reaction to that decision make it essential to find a solution of the issue within the scope of Serbian law and order and the specific choices of its political forces, to highlight the real problems faced by Serbs and free them from the present situation, which is creating fertile soil for any who are scheming against the rights of Serbia and its people, and to back its struggle for peace in the area, democracy and social prosperity."
"From that point of view we cannot condone the intention to impose new measures and conditions upon Serbia with the excuse that we are recognising the democratic rights of the opposition parties."
"This insistence on imposing additional measures which in the last analysis make life more difficult for Serbian people themselves, cannot but be regarded as questionable."
"Whereas after the Dayton Agreement the Serbian people were hoping for the lifting of the sanctions against them, they see that not only is that obligation not being fulfilled, but on the contrary, no opportunity is lost to maintain and extend the measures against them, the more so just when every Press report nowadays shows that the Serbian Government is already moving towards recognition of the opposition's rights and acceptance of the recent municipal election results."
"It is already apparent that the election results have been accepted for the more important towns and cities such as Belgrade and Nis."
"I think the European Parliament's insistence on imposing new measures can be summed up in one word: that effort can only be characterized as hypocrisy, because otherwise words lose their meaning, unless we label that orientation and that view hypocritical."
"Madam President, 1997 is an extremely important year for Europe, as various speakers have rightly pointed out."
"It is also a year in which Europe is being led by small countries."
"The troika consists of Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, small but strong countries which are determined to continue the tradition of sound presidency."
"Ireland certainly did some very good work, and the Netherlands now faces the very special, perhaps even the historic task of concluding or preparing to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference."
"All in all, we feel cautiously confident about the Dutch presidency."
"We have confidence in its traditional, efficient and pragmatic approach, but we are also cautious, because we have read newspaper reports and interviews with prominent representatives of the coalition in the Netherlands, such as Mr Bolkestein, who have said things which are the very opposite of what we want to hear about Europe."
"I am counting on you, Mr van Mierlo and Mr Patijn, not to follow Mr Bolkestein's lead in your presidency of the Intergovernmental Conference, but to follow the Benelux memorandum instead."
"I am pleased that you called for greater use of the qualified majority, which is essential if Europe is to remain workable."
"But I was disappointed that at the very first press conference of the Dutch presidency, it was specifically stressed that unanimity would still be required on matters of fiscal policy."
"Yet the Dutch presidency sets such great store by the link between taxation and employment, and also by the CO2 tax, and we have already established that all the problems we have had with this tax stem from the need for unanimity."
"I should like to address a few words now to Mr Patijn, as president of the Budget Council."
"Mr Patijn, you yourself have witnessed the great uneasiness that now exists between Parliament and the Council."
"I would ask you to try, informally and quickly, to overcome this uneasiness."
"We do of course share some of the responsibility for it, but the blame mainly lies with the Council, which has not really acted as it should have done in recent years."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, on 31 December, a group of Members of this Parliament drank a toast to the Dutch presidency, encouraged as we were by the success of the last Dutch presidency, which culminated in the signing of the Maastricht Treaty."
"On 6 January - Twelfth Day, moreover - the Dutch Finance Minister and President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council made his d√©but with some remarks which showed him to be in favour of creating a very small economic and monetary union, in order - and I quote - to ensure the credibility of the euro."
"As if these remarks were not unfortunate enough, he added that the southern Member States which were seeking to form part of the first wave of the third stage of EMU were guilty of hysteria."
"Acting as a kind of European team selector, moreover, he limited participation in stage three to Germany, the Benelux countries, France and possibly, with luck - so he said - Ireland and Austria."
"You wondered in your speech, Mr President-in-Office, quoting Vaclav Havel, if it was possible to call for a passion for Europe - and this Parliament does of course have that passion. But it is not by means of remarks such as those in question that a passion for Europe will be conveyed to, or caused to grow among, the peoples of which Europe is composed."
"The Dutch Finance Minister's remarks, which you half-heartedly sought to play down the following day, were insensitive, clumsy and in conflict with the Treaty on European Union. Worst of all, they reflected an attitude which is incompatible with the statements of this Parliament, which, although it has always said that it wishes to see a stable, sound, strong and credible euro, has also said that it wishes as many Member States as possible to join the single currency, because this will prevent unnecessary divisions between the North and the South, the rich and poor countries, the Europe of grey roofs and the Europe of the Mediterranean."
"It is said in a Spanish classic which you probably know - ' Don Juan Tenorio' - that a modicum of contrition brings salvation."
"The President-in-Office now has the opportunity to make a formal statement of the obvious and say that - whatever his Finance Minister may think - the only law governing participation in the single currency is that of the Maastricht Treaty; or to make a somewhat more ambitious statement, and say that the Dutch Government wishes a large number of Member States to join the single currency; or finally, in a fit of passion for Europe, to make the statement we would wish to have and interpret the Maastricht Treaty in such a way as to allow the maximum number of Member States to participate in the single currency."
"In a show of generosity, he could also applaud the endeavours of governments such as that of my country, which are making tremendous efforts to form part of the first wave, full of enthusiasm for the latest phase of the process of European integration, which is the third stage of economic and monetary union."
"If he does this, the President-in-Office will probably be saved."
"If he does not, I am sure that he will be damned."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on his detailed speech concerning his country's presidency."
"There is just one issue I should like to address today, and that is the question of Serbia, or rather the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Parliament feels that the Dutch presidency should set to work immediately on this urgent political issue, which we would like to focus on in this debate."
"For weeks now, we have been following developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with some trepidation, weeks of huge yet peaceful protests against the falsification of the local election results."
"For the Serbs, this has obviously been the last straw."
"The Milosevic government has long been sheltered by the international community because of the Dayton Agreements, but this cannot go on."
"Electoral fraud is electoral fraud, and the OSCE representatives judged that this was undoubtedly the case."
"The Serbian Government must obey all the recommendations of the Gonz√°lez mission, there is no question about it."
"The Union cannot do anything with a government that has violated the rules of democracy so seriously."
"Through its actions, the Serbian Government has cut itself off from Europe, and relations must remain frozen until President Milosevic concedes to every demand."
"Commissioner van den Broek also shares this view, it would appear."
"The Union and the Member States must make every effort to ensure that the IMF does not make any concessions to the present Serbian government."
"We are not simply concerned about reinstating the election results: this was just one example of Serbia's worrying democratic standards, which need to be improved."
"The Union needs to make this clear, but it must also be prepared to help to strengthen democracy there."
"It is everyone's responsibility."
"President Milosevic is wavering at the moment, but his concessions have made little impression on the demonstrators, and he obviously still needs a little more encouragement."
"The presidency can help here by organizing a special troika mission to apply the necessary pressure on the spot."
"I was a little disappointed with Mr van Mierlo's statement that although he supports our resolution, he is not sure whether organizing a troika mission is the right thing to do."
"I think the European Union must not wait too long, otherwise we run the risk of allowing the Americans to seize the initiative once again."
"You can never really tell exactly when such a mission should be carried out or how successful it will be."
"I think the people in Belgrade are entitled to expect a European Union presence, and I would repeat that we need to have a more visible profile there."
"It is important for the opposition, but it is also an investment in future relations with what we hope will be a more democratic country."
"Madam President, other speakers have criticized the Dutch Finance Minister's political indiscretion."
"In my opinion, however, this matter should not be allowed to obscure the reality of the programme of the Dutch presidency, and I would congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on being the first of his kind to have interpreted, in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, the essence of what the rotating Council presidency represents, in a way devoid of all self-will or populism directed towards domestic policy objectives."
"Likewise, I believe that Parliament should not dwell excessively on national issues in these six-monthly debates on the Council presidency."
"Having said that, Mr President-in-Office, and keeping to the broad outlines of your programme, I should like to examine various aspects of that European reality to which you refer, with a view to highlighting a number of the issues which Parliament considers to be important."
"To my mind, it is essential for your presidency to devote itself to clearing the Council's desk. The Council is the institution which most delays the adoption of draft directives and regulations."
"It is not the Commission or Parliament which holds up the legislative process; it is the Council."
"This is an outstanding matter, therefore, and we are expecting you to do everything possible to resolve it."
"You will also be performing a great service if you promote the spirit of the Treaties in the Council, as opposed to certain practices which fundamentally conflict with the provisions of those Treaties."
"I am referring to the fact that, all too often, the Council seeks a consensus, even in cases where the Treaties allow it to decide by qualifiedmajority voting."
"This is contrary to the Treaties and also unnecessarily delays a large number of decisions."
"In the same spirit, Mr President-in-Office, you must nip in the bud the attempts of some Member States to bring certain policies back under national control."
"I refer in particular to environment policy; in this respect, it should be pointed out that we have been waiting for the realization of one of the proposals which you highlight in your programme - final implementation of the agreement on the CO2 energy tax - since 1992, the year in which the Earth Summit took place, when we made a formal international commitment to bringing this legislative measure into effect in the European Union in the near future."
"With regard to internal policy matters, it is in my view a matter of urgency finally to adopt the Convention on the Common European Frontier Agreement, as well as to implement measures to combat terrorism and, of course - as other speakers have said - illegal drug trafficking."
"Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, I believe that the fundamental nature of the parallel competences of the national parliaments and the European Parliament must not be changed in the next Treaty."
"Any fundamental altering or mingling of those competences would be very detrimental to the future of our work."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to say that in the field of the environment, at least, I welcome the aims of the Dutch presidency."
"I find their programme a curious mixture of worthwhile ambition and unrealism: unrealism because I think there are problems about timetables and the machinery of the Community that are not reflected in the programme they have published."
"That realism really has to be developed."
"It is laudable that they want to ensure that environment and health policies are properly integrated with other policies, especially employment."
"That is very good."
"I am very pleased they are taking that seriously."
"But I have one or two specific comments I want to make."
"I hope that during the six months of the Dutch presidency they will make progress with the fifth Environmental Action Programme, first of all by ensuring that the Council agreement of December is actually transmitted to Parliament so that we can begin work on the second reading."
"I hope that they will work to reach an agreement on both drinking and bathing water."
"We have already had the first reading in Parliament and I do not see any reason why they should not make progress."
"I am very hopeful that they can."
"Thirdly, I agree with them that implementation and enforcement of environment policy are tremendously important issues, but I would ask them not to reach an agreement at the first Environment Council but rather to wait until the second one so that they can have the benefit of consultation and discussion with Parliament on this very important subject."
"Fourthly, I hope that they will try to deal with the auto oil programme, again, not at the first Environment Council but at the second one, because we can help there."
"Lastly, I hope that they will recognize that we do not yet have the framework programme on water and that they will therefore encourage the Commission to reach agreement on that so that we can begin to work jointly."
"I wish them well for their six months in spite of the obstructionism of certain Member States in the Council."
"Mr President, following the detailed speech by Mr van Mierlo, I have a few comments to make that will perhaps give him the sort of passionate response I know he is so keen to elicit."
"I would remind him that European integration was an extremely bold venture undertaken by earlier generations who hoped to realize a dream."
"The idea was that there should be much less talk of swords, and much more of the efficient use of ploughshares."
"This has actually worked very successfully, and I suppose you could say that we are now living in a kind of 'paradise found' ."
"But in the hands of pragmatic bureaucrats, all this becomes in the long run is an empty shell, an edifice, as you said in your speech."
"However, I think it is very important to help the Netherlands Government to maintain its momentum in the presidency, which I assume will be safe in your capable hands."
"Turning now to the third pillar, which forms part of this edifice, I think that people are coming to realize that clinging on to national sovereignty does not serve the interests of public security."
"This is why it is so important for a sovereign decision to be taken to tackle crime at European level."
"It is particularly dangerous to go blindly forward in a sector which is one of the most traditional responsibilities of the constitutional state without giving the European Court the necessary powers and without the necessary parliamentary controls at European level."
"You are familiar with our parliamentary committee of inquiry in the Netherlands into the conduct of the police and judiciary."
"We must realize that it is very foolhardy to press on with measures in this field without having the scope for such inquiries at European level."
"It is not our intention, and never has been, to take powers away from the national parliaments, but simply to provide a safe Community haven for those powers which have been abandoned on the wrong doorstep at the Council in Brussels."
"I think you need to be rather more ambitious, and on the subject of asylum policy you made a rather amusing comment about the policy in the Netherlands."
"You said that the Commission is to be made responsible for coming up with a fraud-proof passport."
"Is that not simply the Netherlands Government acting in its own interests?"
"From a historical standpoint, I cannot help but find this slightly amusing."
"Mr President, the Dutch presidency is not going to be an easy one."
"There is a serious risk that no major decisions can be taken before the British elections, by which time there will be only a few weeks' working time left before the Amsterdam summit."
"To finalize, during those few weeks, what others have failed to institute during several months sounds like attempting the impossible - and this is an area where the public expects much from the European Union."
"What it expects is guaranteed personal safety, effective action against international organized crime, and against the crimes committed against children, drug trafficking, fraud and corruption."
"Yet what does the record show?"
"In all these areas, the intergovernmental conference has proved ineffective."
"In judicial cooperation, in police cooperation, the story is always the same: organized crime has created its European theatre of operations, while those who should be fighting it are taking cover behind the rampart of their so-called sovereign interests and so achieving little or nothing."
"To continue along this road, Mr President, is to face certain failure."
"What we must have, if we are to solve these problems, are Community structures, not just to deal with visas, asylum and immigration but also, and most important of all, to deal with crime prevention and with cooperation between police and judicial authorities."
"So there are two inescapable conclusions. First, let those who cling to their sovereignty understand that unless they pool something of that sovereignty they risk losing all of it."
"And secondly, let the Dutch presidency, if it finds it has too little time to finish tying up an efficient package for combating organized crime, leave the job unfinished and hand it on to the next presidency."
"Better to be patient and finish up with workable legislation rather than rush matters and then spend years suffering the consequences of a system that doesn't work."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their comments - for their praise and appreciation, of course, but also for their criticisms."
"We are at the very beginning of our period in office, and as President I naturally have my own ideas on all kinds of things to do with Europe, but as President I also have to listen to what people say, because all their comments will be relevant when it comes to finding a consensus."
"I am therefore grateful for almost all the criticisms which have been voiced, apart from those which had a strongly national flavour."
"One Member had a good deal to say in this vein, including, rather unnecessarily, that she felt Dutch through and through."
"Well, she certainly made that clear."
"But I am also grateful to her for her criticisms, which I shall also be able to use, and that applies to everyone's comments."
"I can be fairly brief in my reply, since many of the remarks made come under the portfolios of other ministers, whom you will be seeing here on many other occasions."
"I have noted all your comments, most of which were on specific areas - almost everything that Mr Collins said, for example - and I shall be forwarding them to the relevant ministers in their capacity as Presidents of the Council."
"They will be able to discuss the issues with you in much more detail."
"Many speakers have pointed out - Mr Oostlander most forcefully, perhaps - that this is a crucial year."
"The construction of Europe was started with great passion, no one would dispute that."
"What I said was that we need not try to fire everyone with enthusiasm about it all at once, but at the same time those of us who are actively involved must feel passionately about it, otherwise it will not work."
"What I need is passion of a practical kind, and I need to find it in others if I am to be able to carry out my task."
"As I said, I cannot go into every point in detail, but I shall look at a few areas that were mentioned by almost everyone."
"Employment was a topic which brought out various responses, with some people feeling optimistic and others disappointed."
"Yet others were afraid that the environment would lose out."
"Since the Essen summit, it has been increasingly clear that the whole issue of employment is a task for the presidency and the Union."
"Any disputes have mainly been about how to provide for it in the Treaty."
"It would appear at the moment, when I look around, that there are still some countries which are sceptical about whether the Union really can do something about unemployment, but they are not sceptical about the objectives or responsibilities, simply whether the Union can produce the right instruments to do the job."
"Gradually, though, even those who are more sceptical are gaining a better understanding, and it seems likely that we shall be including a specific chapter on this in the Treaty."
"I shall turn now to the subject of EMU, which many speakers seem to think is the enemy of our employment objectives."
"This is a complete misconception, in my view."
"Every country reorganizing its economy sees the shortterm negative effects which this has on employment, but the eventual result can have the effect of creating many more jobs."
"We have been through this ourselves in the Netherlands, and we are now reaping the rewards."
"The same will be true when EMU is introduced."
"EMU is not the enemy of employment."
"It may be that the kind of measures it entails could have negative effects in the short term, but it is actually expected to be more likely to increase the capacity for creating jobs."
"I think at this point I should repeat - rather unnecessarily, since I made myself very clear during my first speech, but it seems, from what I have heard, that not everyone understood me - what the position of the Dutch cabinet is on the issue of admission to EMU."
"I should firstly like to say something in defence of my colleague from the Ministry of Finance."
"I was shown the reports in the various foreign newspapers - this was how I heard about it - and I was shocked and wondered if that was really what he had said or meant to say."
"I asked him about it, and received an entirely proper explanation."
"The word hysteria was used in the context of a description of countries which will not be ready until a year or two after the first year, but before the euro is introduced."
"These are countries which are expected to be involved in EMU from the beginning, and in this context he said that he would prefer them to wait, rather than making hysterical attempts to be ready in one year."
"I shall not comment on the substance of what he said, but he certainly meant it to be friendly, and the countries in question should not in any event take offence at his comments."
"Now, as to the position which the Dutch cabinet has held for the last two years, the position held by the Prime Minister and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance, I explained it quite clearly, and I cannot put it in plainer terms: everyone who meets the criteria is welcome, and the more the merrier."
"There are no hidden agendas."
"This is what we have always said."
"However, the view taken in the Netherlands is that we need to be strict in applying the criteria, and that there must be no cheating, and I am speaking here in particular to those countries which have had a whole week in which to savour their indignation."
"There are a few points I should like to make about democracy."
"This covers everything that people associate with the decision-making process, including transparency and parliamentary controls."
"It is playing a very prominent role in the discussions at the IGC, and I am hopeful that some genuine results will be achieved."
"The Dutch presidency is very enthusiastic about the idea of reducing the democratic deficit, and our proposals contain a number of suggestions for giving the European Parliament greater powers to exercise controls."
"But we are not the only ones with ideas here, and everyone knows that opinions vary on the subject."
"Some countries take a completely different view from others, but then this is true of so many things."
"Our job is to achieve consensus."
"But the main thing I can tell you at the moment is that you should have no doubts about the importance we attach to it."
"Turning now to the comments made about human rights, this is something to which I devoted considerable attention."
"I said that it was an area of growing responsibility for Europe, which was taken as meaning that the Netherlands prefers to leave human rights policy to Europe."
"Let me just say one thing here."
"We are not 'leaving it to Europe' out of laziness, since I think that every country is finding it difficult to pursue an effective human rights policy on its own."
"This is why we need to find new ways of addressing the subject with emerging economies such as China and the whole of South-East Asia, including Indonesia since it is so important, and we need to ensure that we can bring pressure to bear to protect human rights values or to reintroduce them where they have been lost."
"So you must interpret what I said as a very positive statement."
"There were a number of comments about the third pillar."
"Let me repeat how important this topic is for the Netherlands, and not just as window-dressing or because various aspects of drugs policy have become a sensitive issue between France and the Netherlands."
"You claim that our differences on this issue are set to continue for quite some time, yet I have to say that there is growing support for a drugs policy which may well be an entirely national approach and may be organized in a typically Dutch way, but nevertheless produces results which, to be quite honest, are very much better than those achieved in neighbouring countries."
"It is extremely difficult."
"What country could convince its citizens that it should give up a policy which has brought such good results simply because another country wants it to, or because it is so misunderstood?"
"However, this does not mean that the Netherlands does not also bear a great responsibility where its policy has negative effects across the border in other countries."
"I can assure you that I see this as a challenge, and I am proud that the Netherlands is now to lead the high-level group which is to develop a joint approach to both crime and drugs, and which can direct the framing of the joint action about which so much has been said."
"I am sure that we can demonstrate that we need more intensive and effective cooperation in this field, without having to give up the main elements of our various national policies."
"I should like to comment on the subject of Yugoslavia and war criminals; Mr de Vries referred to this, but I think everyone feels the same about it."
"We have been urged to take action on this issue."
"Let me tell you this."
"I think that if we do not do something about it, the fact that the war criminals are still walking around free could be our greatest obstacle in achieving the objective we have set ourselves in Bosnia-Herzegovina of creating a multi-ethnic state which can also function properly as such."
"Not only that, but the fact that the war crimes tribunal which symbolizes the world's conscience no longer has any criminals to try is an insult to our attempts to establish the rule of law and to protect civilized values."
"That is why we are not sitting back."
"I do admit that it is very difficult to secure the arrest of these people with the existing forces in Yugoslavia."
"I shall not go into details here - you know some of what I am referring to."
"However, the fact that no effective action has been taken up to now certainly does not mean that the European Union is happy with the situation."
"This brings us to an area which it is difficult to talk about in public, because it involves other types of measures."
"The only thing I ask is that you believe me when I say that we are not happy with the situation and that we cannot allow it to continue."
"A number of comments have been made regarding flexibility and, as I said earlier, from an intellectual point of view, this is our most difficult problem."
"The best way of summing it up is this: we need it, but it must be treated with suspicion, because otherwise the process of integration will be in jeopardy before you know it."
"This is the attitude we should adopt if, as I said, we are to be able to reconcile the need for enlargement with the need for consolidation."
"Different speeds can be used as a bridge here, if they are applied carefully and cautiously."
"This is another area where I can see that opinions differ, but nevertheless I am sure that we can produce acceptably worded paragraphs on flexibility for inclusion in the Treaty, although the Community as a whole is extremely reluctant to include flexibility in the first pillar."
"It is different with the second pillar, because there we are trying to escape from the stranglehold of the veto, which it is absolutely essential to do, as Mr Bertens and many others such as Mr de Vries pointed out."
"We are determined to have a more effective and active foreign policy: it is not that votes are taken very often, but the very fact that the veto exists casts a shadow over the whole decisionmaking process in the Council."
"All too often, consensus either means that no decision is taken, or that it is based on the lowest common denominator."
"A word now about Cyprus, which many speakers referred to."
"As I have already said, if we cannot find a solution to the Cyprus problem, there is at least a risk that our scope for expanding NATO and for enlarging the Union will be restricted."
"We need to be very cautious here."
"It is certainly true that we currently have a window of opportunity for taking action."
"There are elections in Cyprus next year, and we really need to prepare the ground now for the negotiations that are to be held six months after the IGC is concluded."
"The situation has improved slightly, but it is only a temporary reprieve, linked to the fact that the missiles which have been ordered will not be in position for another sixteen months, and the question of the overflying of Turkish and Greek aircraft."
"I have called on both parties to refrain from any action that could cause an escalation in tension."
"I should like to reply to a specific point which Mr Bertens raised, which is not really relevant here but does have a European element, and that is the possibility of supplying missiles to Turkey."
"The simple fact is that we are talking here about a NATO country, which therefore falls into the category of countries to which arms may be supplied."
"There is concern that the missiles could be used against the Kurds, but every official application to purchase arms is assessed on the basis of whether it would increase tension in the area involved, and these are the criteria that will be applied here, as everywhere else."
"But no application to purchase arms has yet been made, and anticipating the decision that would be taken if it were would in itself heighten tension, so I refuse to do so."
"Just one final comment about the Middle East."
"Someone said that our interests there are different from those of the Americans, but if this is true, it only applies to certain details."
"The situation in the Middle East is not only a threat to peace in the region in general, but failure to reach peace will threaten the whole world."
"So I think that America and Europe basically share the same interests here."
"I shall stop there, and although I know that I have not been able to answer all the points that were raised, I am sure I shall be returning to the House on many occasions and will have the chance to deal with all these issues in more detail then."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am sorry to say that you have really only replied to Dutch colleagues, although we are after all a European Parliament."
"'European' means German, French, Portuguese and so on!"
"I made a very specific comment on Serbia, and I should like a specific answer from you on Serbia - not only from Mr van den Broek, but also from the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Please, Mr President-in-Office, let us hear just a few words, but ones of substance."
"I would ask Members to appreciate the fact that this debate has been very long, and time is pressing."
"Mr President, you are quite right, it is a very important point, but your own timetable rather put me under pressure."
"Mr Wiersma also said how disappointed he was that I have not agreed to take a troika to Serbia immediately."
"On my visits to the various capitals, Serbia has always been discussed in detail, and I can tell you that views on the issue are very similar and that everyone is prepared to do whatever is most effective."
"When we can go there and actually achieve something, we shall be sure to go."
"But there is no point in going simply for the sake of going, because if you then come back empty-handed it could actually be counter-productive, whereas you might find that if you had only waited a few days, you could have achieved something useful."
"In other words, we must be sure that what we do will be effective, but I can assure you that every country is 100 % behind those who have shown that there is another side to Belgrade apart from what President Milosevic has shown us."
"You need have no doubts, everyone has said this so far, and I do not expect to hear anything different on the rest of my travels."
"Mr President, I too would like to take up precisely the point raised by Mrs Pack: I do not think answers should be given solely for the benefit of Dutch Members."
"Yesterday I brought up before the Minister the issue of the statement made by Mr Erbakan, and it is all over the European Press today that Turkey is ready to move against Greece, the Turkish army is ready to do what it did in 1974 against Cyprus."
"The President cannot remain silent about that issue, that threat against a Member State."
"I expect an immediate statement from the President."
"There is one question that was raised by three groups but has not been answered, about the Dutch presidency's position on Parliament's hopes to see both its budgetary powers and its legislative powers extended."
"You have said you support us, but a number of comments which have been made have cast doubts on your support for our budgetary powers, and we take a very serious view of that."
"We should like to hear what Mr van Mierlo has to say about this."
"There were three other groups as well as my own which raised this point."
"Mr President, I restricted myself to asking two questions, but the fact is that I did not receive an answer to either of them."
"The first was very simple: has the Dutch presidency scheduled for the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in April an initial assessment of the revision of the financial perspectives, with a view to the financing of the European Union in the post-1999 period?"
"And the second - and important - question was: following the latest round of negotiations, and especially its contacts with the present British Government, has the Dutch presidency provided for the possibility of the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference on the reform of the Treaties being adopted by only 14 Member States?"
"I shall be very brief, Minister."
"You said that there was not a single dissenting voice."
"Well, I seem to recall that five years ago, during the massacres at Vukovar, while this House was still supporting the Yugoslav Red Army, there were very few dissenting voices - those of my friends and myself. Today, we are piling ridicule on shame."
"Mr President, on the subject of Turkey, I have decided to ask the Association Council to discuss relations with that country."
"Turkey is a member of NATO, and while there is much to criticize it for, you have to look at both the positive and negative sides, and this is why we need to hold a meeting of the Association Council with Turkey as soon as possible in order to discuss these issues."
"Yesterday, I expressly urged the parties involved, including Mr Erbakan, not to do or say anything likely to increase tension."
"However, we must not underestimate the increase in tension caused by the views both sides are currently exchanging."
"Both sides need to curb their behaviour, otherwise we shall have no chance of finding a solution to the Cyprus question, for example."
"On the subject of budgetary powers, I would simply say the following: the talks on the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure at the IGC have not indicated - and I think this is something you should be aware of - that the distinction is likely to be abolished."
"This is not to say that everyone thinks that we should keep the status quo, but as I think I told you earlier, some aspects of the integration process are, by definition, gradual."
"I do not for the time being expect there to be much scope for changing the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"The Finance Ministers need to decide in ECOFIN whether to hold an informal meeting on the financial perspectives."
"The programme for the Dutch presidency does say that we might meet informally simply in order to take note of views, but there have been so many protests against the idea that it is now doubtful whether this meeting will actually take place."
"I personally feel that if one country says that there was an agreement not to do this, and insists on the point, then we cannot change the agenda on the issue."
"But if we did hold the meeting, it would simply be an informal and non-committal exchange of views."
"A question was also asked about the situation regarding the United Kingdom."
"It is difficult to answer this very briefly without treading on anyone's toes."
"I do not think it is a good idea for the Fourteen to try to take decisions together, leaving the United Kingdom in an isolated position on all the issues in question."
"This would be counterproductive and encourage polarization in the United Kingdom's election campaign, which would certainly not be in our interests."
"I do not feel the slightest need to interfere in the election campaign in the United Kingdom."
"It is none of our business, it is their democracy and values that are at stake, and it would be wrong for me to say who I hope will win."
"The only thing I can do, and I am speaking for a good many people here, is to hope that they manage not to be too negative regarding Europe in the campaign."
"If they are negative, and the most anti-European candidates secure the most votes - I am not saying that this is what will happen, but if it does - the winner, whoever it is, will have very little room to negotiate for some time afterwards."
"And let us be honest, we need the British to help us build Europe and we want to keep them on board."
"If we are to do this, we need to play our part too."
"So we must try hard to forget that the problem exists."
"Let them conduct their own campaign, and let us try to get through the various issues as constructively as possible and avoid creating situations where the British are left isolated on every key point just before the elections."
"But otherwise I think we would do well not to worry too much about the British elections."
"It is also wrong to think that the United Kingdom is the only country which is preventing consensus on a number of vital issues: this is simply not true, and we must refuse to allow this impression to continue."
"It is not in the United Kingdom's interests, and it is certainly not in Europe's."
"Thank you, Mr van Mierlo."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I believe that the way in which we set our agenda and plan our business must be improved in the daily conduct of our work."
"I would ask you to draw the Bureau's attention to the need for debates such as the one that we have just concluded to be better prepared and allocated sufficient time, so that when, as at present, the Council presidency is willing to answer questions frankly and in a customary parliamentary way, it is able to do so."
"Such debates should not be treated as ordinary ones, since they are very important to us."
"I should also like to remind you that on the agenda of the next part-session is a debate with the European Council."
"I hope that the European Council will be informed that it will have sufficient time to engage in a genuine open dialogue with Parliament, of a kind for which the House has repeatedly called and which is essential to our institution."
"I would ask you to pass on this request to the Bureau."
"Very well, I shall convey that request to the Bureau."
"Distance selling"
"The next item is the report (A4-0009/97) by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text (C4-0666/96-00/0411(COD)), approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts (rapporteur: Mrs Oomen-Ruijten)."
"Mr President, the conciliation procedure on distance selling has, to my mind, produced an excellent result."
"We have achieved a great deal in these negotiations - more in fact than the Council wished to see - and it is the first time that the Council's stance has changed between the common position after second reading and the conciliation procedure, in the sense that for the first time the Council, having initially rejected Parliament's wishes, then nevertheless agreed to them unanimously."
"Following all Parliament's amendments, it has now for the first time adopted a proposal on these lines by a qualified majority."
"I noticed in the delegation that insisting on explanations from the Council - explanations of why it was doing something - and following up with questions was an approach which could bear fruit, and thus of the 31 amendments, as many as 26 were included in the text either as they stood or in an adapted form."
"Three amendments thereby became redundant, mainly for technical reasons, and two others were withdrawn by the rapporteur on practical grounds."
"That is a good result, when one thinks that the Council did not wish to accept a single amendment in the first instance."
"Ultimately, we now have a directive which meets an urgent need."
"It is an important piece of consumer protection in an area where there are no European rules at all, but where they are very much required."
"It is important in view of the tremendous upsurge in distance selling of goods and services."
"More and more use is being made of existing and also new technologies."
"We are buying records via television, we buy clothes through the Internet, and we book our holidays by telephone."
"These are being used more and more."
"And we are not just doing this in our own countries, but also approaching suppliers across borders and being approached by them."
"When making purchases in the internal market, a responsible consumer must be enabled to proceed in an informed way and to make considered choices."
"That is not only in the interests of the consumer, but also in the interests of those supplying goods or services."
"For these choices to be identified, a number of conditions have to be met."
"One of the main points is the right to thorough information."
"The directive provides that, before a contract is concluded, the consumer must be aware of such things as the price, the most important features, the method of payment and, where appropriate, the cost of delivering the goods or services."
"Also, where payment is made in advance, Parliament wishes the money to be reimbursed if the corresponding service is not provided."
"We have laid down a number of conditions in the directive with regard to marketing."
"A ban has been imposed on the use of faxes and automatic calling machines, and if the telephone is used for canvassing or marketing, there is at least now a rule whereby people can no longer simply be disturbed during their meals."
"A very important point which the Council was in fact reluctant to accept, and which was previously only dealt with in the small print of a contract, is the supply of goods of equivalent value."
"This means that if I have to conduct an election campaign in my country and need some green T-shirts, and they supply me with red T-shirts, then while I may well be able to dispose of them to the socialists, I actually wanted green ones."
"It must therefore be possible for me to return the red T-shirts and get my money back on them."
"This kind of case, normally only dealt with in the small print, is now included in the legislation, something which took a great deal of trouble."
"Then there is the question of financial services."
"An amendment which we had tabled on this issue was unfortunately rejected by a few votes - for which we have to thank a number of our colleagues in the Liberal Group, and from the other side of the House."
"What we did manage to achieve - and I also say this to my colleague Mr Herman - is that we now have an undertaking from the Council with regard to the Green Paper on financial services, so that where there are gaps, there will be further scope for legislation."
"Something which should now be settled, and which is completely new, is the question of taking legal action."
"In this legislation, we have provided that consumer organizations can also take legal action in another jurisdiction."
"I think this is something entirely new."
"I would also draw attention to the system of self-regulation which, I believe, provides ample scope for dealing with any complaints, and to the delivery of flowers, which will be covered by the directive."
"It is also quite a novelty that in a conciliation procedure, in joint discussions between the Council and Parliament, a good solution has been found in this respect."
"Mr President, we have discussed great matters at great length this afternoon but it is appropriate now that one of the ornaments of Dutch politics should be making the first speech in this Dutch presidency in a cause which she has made very much her own in recent years."
"I would like to congratulate her on the time she has devoted to bringing this directive to a most a satisfactory phase of conciliation."
"I should also like to apologize to her in advance and to Commissioner Bangemann to whom I should like to ask a question because I have to go almost immediately to ask another question of President Santer in the temporary committee on BSE which is meeting simultaneously with this debate."
"I just want to make a few very brief points because much has already been said by the rapporteur."
"Firstly, the enormous increase in direct selling leaves the consumer with both the best and the worst of this new world."
"The best, in that there is access to a whole range of new services."
"The worst in that there is no protection in terms of knowledge about the selling techniques that are used."
"Sometimes the consumer in this position faces what in English, borrowing from Dutch, we call a forlorn hope."
"I think in Dutch it is verloren hoop ."
"That position, in which you do not know enough of what is happening to, and around, you is something this directive has attempted to rectify."
"I am delighted that twenty-six of the propositions that went to conciliation have been accepted, particularly given the rather lamentable history and the two years' delay in the previous Parliament when this issue was locked up in the Council."
"That process has now been unlocked and I am delighted by the achievements we have made."
"I would like to say a few words about the matters that the rapporteur has raised."
"We have received a number of important additions to the text."
"We have now given consumers seven working days in which to change their minds."
"They are going to be properly informed when they are going to be sent substitute goods."
"They are going to be reimbursed if they change their minds and they have the right to full reimbursement if the supplier goes bankrupt or fails to perform the service involved."
"Those are marvellous points and together with the protection from 'cold calling' by telephone, an amendment which I have been concerned with before, they add up to a real degree of protection."
"There remains, however, the problem of financial services."
"Commissioner Bonino made a commitment to come forward with a communication on financial services and, if necessary, a directive."
"One year later we only have a weak Green Paper and no legislation."
"On behalf of the committee and personally I want to ask Commissioner Bangemann where the Commission now stands on this proposal?"
"This Parliament would urge the Commission and the new Director-General of DG XXIV - when appointed - to show the same determination about legislation in this field of financial services that the rapporteur has shown."
"Lastly, coming from a country whose government is recalcitrant as far as consumer organizations being able to bring class actions in the courts is concerned, I welcome that possibility that is now available in all Member States."
"As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten correctly says, this is a new departure and one which I hope will be taken up in all countries including my own."
"I would urge the UK to allow legitimate consumer organizations, and not just the DirectorGeneral of Fair Trading, to take such actions."
"As a result of the hard work of all those involved in this directive, but most notably the rapporteur, consumers no longer have a forlorn hope but a firm assurance that they will have the right measure of protection."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to some of the amendments put before the House at second reading, we are now discussing a compromise which shows more realism and is acceptable to all Members of Parliament."
"I am particularly pleased that financial services have been excluded."
"It is not that I wish to spare this sector, but the fact is that the special nature of financial transactions is incompatible with the general character of this directive."
"Further inquiries, for example through the Green Paper, are bound to bring to light the problems which exist."
"I am also in favour of Article 10 on the use of certain communications techniques and what is referred to as cold calling."
"Unfortunately, the compromise which has been reached is in danger of being stillborn, since cold calling is dealt with in a different and less pragmatic way in the ISDN directive."
"To prevent this, I have tabled an amendment to the Medina Ortega report, on behalf of my group."
"In any event, my group supports the compromise which has been achieved on this directive on distance selling."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that has returned to us from the Council under the conciliation procedure is concerned with the legal harmonization of the system of distance contracts, which is giving rise to a degree of unfair competition."
"Many such techniques are in use today: mail shots, circulars, catalogues, phone calls with or without human or automatic intervention, radio, video phone, fax, TV telesales - and more to come in the future with CD-ROM, modems providing link-ups between personal computers, and so on."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, and I note that the Directive provides for a variety of instruments to enable these objectives to be achieved: periods allowed for withdrawal, reversal of the burden of proof under certain conditions, distinction between professionals and amateurs, exclusion of certain types of contract, especially those relating to financial services, specific information, etc."
"My only reservation concerns the fact that one piece of information that seems to me quite essential does not appear in the draft Directive and is not mentioned in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's excellent report."
"This is the question of applicable law."
"Is it the law of the place where the sale originates or its place of destination?"
"The place where acceptance begins or the place where it ends?"
"This question is absolutely fundamental, especially as regards the possibility that the contracts may be subject to the law of a third country, which would enable European legislation to be circumvented."
"In any case, I believe we would benefit from greater harmonization of the rules of international private law rather than substantive law."
"Mr President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was too modest."
"This really is an outstanding success, a result of her work of which you are entitled to be proud, and I warmly congratulate her on it."
"I shall deal very briefly with two issues which were raised."
"Mr Whitehead and others mentioned financial services."
"As you know, we have presented a Green Paper on these, which is still being considered in Parliament's committees."
"As soon as these discussions have been concluded, we shall of course bring forward proposals, which will also take up what Parliament has contributed to this debate."
"As regards what was said by Mr Gollnisch, this proposal does not change the general law."
"In other words, on the question of which law applies, the general rules which already exist today are valid."
"We do not need to take any further action on them, because they are sufficiently clear."
"There is an international convention, and that naturally remains applicable here."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Novel foods and food ingredients"
"The next item is the report (A4-0006/97) by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text (C4-0667/96-00/0426(COD)) approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Regulation concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (rapporteur: Mrs Roth-Behrendt)."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the splendid negotiations which she undertook in the Conciliation Committee."
"I also wish to thank the Commission, which facilitated that final agreement, because during the course of that conciliation its role and help was most acceptable."
"Like Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I feel that this is an agreement which does not really need defending: it speaks for itself."
"Had we not reached the kind of agreement which we did reach, then I could not say, as I now do, that labelling will be required when there has been change which is necessary to be indicated on the label."
"The deletion of the word 'significant' and the concessions which the Council made in agreeing to the deletion of that word - if I may be excused a pun - were significant."
"We have some tortuous language as a result of the compromise that has been made. Now we say 'if food is no longer equivalent to an existing food or ingredient.'"
"I regret that. It is clumsy and it would have been better simply to have deleted the word 'significant' and left it at that."
"I must say to those who criticise us that I accept entirely what Mrs Roth-Behrendt has just said."
"Can we reasonably expect the 15 Member States to suddenly coordinate their legislation and insist on labelling throughout the European Union?"
"In fact it is the European Parliament, using the power of codecision in a positive way, which has insisted on the protection of consumers which otherwise would not have been achieved on the original Commission proposal."
"If that sounds self-satisfied, so be it, but we are here to represent the wider European electorate and, in that respect, we have achieved our aims."
"I am very grateful to all those concerned in the Conciliation Committee for the compromise which we have collectively achieved."
"Mr President, as other speakers have said, at this final stage of the debate, we have to concern ourselves with the message that we are sending to the public."
"And that message must be a message of safety: that the safety and information requirements for these products have been improved."
"It must therefore be a positive message."
"Similarly, we must emphasize that this regulation provides for effective scientific assessment designed to prevent any risk to the environment; that it ensures that all consumers' right to health will be safeguarded; and that it lays down additional specific requirements to inform consumers whenever necessary."
"Furthermore, with regard to labelling, which was the subject of a fierce political struggle, the important thing is for the product to be a quality product - just as the important thing in respect of road traffic is to have safe roads, and not bad roads which are full of danger signs and warnings."
"And that is what we have attempted to do here: firstly, ensure the primary safety of consumers; and, secondly, provide them with adequate information."
"In this context, I also welcome the fact that we have struck a balance with the formula 'no longer equivalent' to an existing food, whilst providing for mechanisms to interpret this criterion precisely."
"I believe that we can rest assured in this respect, and that this is the essential message we must send to consumers."
"With this joint text, moreover, the Union's institutions are bringing to a close a debate which has gone on far too long, and it is good that Parliament has taken such an active part in that debate."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the task that she has accomplished - despite some initial differences of opinion which we had - and of course to thank Mr Bangemann, who assisted us in the final stage of our negotiations with the Council. It is only fair to acknowledge that."
"The Group of the European People's Party fully supports the solution that we have arrived at with this joint text."
"Mr President, we can be pleased with the result which has been achieved here, and we can congratulate in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"This is of course a compromise, but when we consider that a few months ago, there was still a great deal of resistance in many Member States to the common position, I would say that we have achieved something."
"The crucial point for us is naturally that products or ingredients which are modified must now be labelled."
"That is vitally important for the consumer."
"We in the Liberal Group see it as essential for the consumer to be able to make the choice between a genetically modified item and an unmodified one."
"Of course this is a compromise - and I say this to our Green colleagues - but if you vote against this proposal, then that will be a step backwards."
"It is either something or nothing."
"If we have something, we can also apply better controls, and we shall have better legislation."
"Just think, for example, of the decision on genetically modified maize."
"Now we shall have something to work on with the Commission at Community level."
"I would say let us all vote in favour of this proposal, and then we shall not be left empty-handed."
"Mr President, the compromise text now before the House constitutes a regulation on 'nonlabelling' and deceives consumers!"
"It will not ensure the comprehensive labelling of genetically modified products and is misleading."
"Consumers will still be groping in the dark."
"Milk derived from cows which have been treated with genetically modified growth hormones will not be labelled, nor will soya oil made from genetically modified soya beans."
"To talk of comprehensive labelling here is quite simply fraudulent."
"The 'novel foods' regulation is based on this dubious compromise text."
"With regard to more than 80 % of genetically modified foods, it is a regulation designed to maintain secrecy."
"The majority of genetically modified foods will be foisted on consumers through the back door."
"This is tantamount to force-feeding."
"There is not a single phrase in the regulation about the content of the labelling."
"Consumers have a right to clear and unequivocal labelling."
"However, the content of the labelling will largely be left up to the manufacturers, and they will use vague and euphemistic terms such as 'produced using modern biotechnological techniques' , or 'nutritionally optimized' ; indeed, I have even heard some industry representatives say that the products should be labelled 'produced using environmentally-friendly techniques' ."
"This makes a mockery of consumer protection and of consumers' wish to have clear and comprehensive labelling!"
"One thing is clear, therefore: this compromise text will create confusion amongst consumers and give the genetic technology industry a free hand."
"Nor does it provide for a responsible authorization procedure."
"For the majority of genetically modified products, simply registering with the Commission will be enough, and the compromise text guarantees absolutely no consumer protection."
"Where are the health inspection criteria?"
"There are absolutely none!"
"To talk of consumer protection here is pure deceit!"
"The risks for people and the environment are predetermined."
"Genetically modified foods will remain a game of Russian roulette for people suffering from allergies."
"There is no provision for a public register or comprehensive liability."
"This will hardly help to inspire consumer confidence either."
"This compromise text represents a blow to consumer protection and is as full of holes as a Swiss cheese."
"The statement that a bad regulation is better than none at all represents a show of political incompetence and is wrong."
"This regulation will prevent the adoption of extensive labelling rules in the Member States."
"I would recommend to the rapporteur that she look at her contributions to the debates at first and second readings."
"This compromise text constitutes a betrayal of consumer protection!"
"It is a lousy, rotten piece of legislation that will permanently shake our citizens' confidence in the European Union!"
"I would strongly urge the House to reject this misleading regulation, which is designed to maintain secrecy!"
"Mr President, in my country 85 % of the population does not want to consume genetically-modified foods."
"If our assembly wants to respect the democratic principle of freedom of choice for consumers, we have to guarantee the transparency of origin of the ingredients of our daily bread."
"That means that the consumer must have the right to know how the corn and the soya that he eats is produced."
"The compromise directive which we are discussing right now does not give any guarantee in this sense."
"In practice, the criteria for labelling genetically-modified foods would only be established after this directive had been adopted and would be worked out by the Commission."
"We call that, in Luxembourgish, ' buying a cat in a bag' ."
"Seriously, I do not think we should do that."
"On the other hand, the criteria for compliance with food safety regulations do not exist yet and again are to be established by the Commission alone."
"After all we have seen with mad cow disease, Parliament should not hand over this responsibility to the Commission."
"Should the assembly vote in favour of this compromise, the procedure of registration would be the so-called 'simplified procedure' ."
"This registration would not take place within food administrations of the Member States, but at the Commission itself."
"I doubt whether the Commission actually has enough staff to build up the controlling bodies with the knowledge required."
"In practice the Commission would have to trust the producers."
"I personally would not do that."
"For these reasons - the lack of transparency and the lack of safety for consumers - I recommend rejection of this compromise."
"Mr President, the Conciliation Committee and Mrs Roth-Behrendt in particular deserve great praise for having removed the exemption from compulsory labelling for products which contain or consist of GMOs, where the genetic modification has been carried out only for agronomic reasons."
"We know that European consumers are very sceptical about genetic modifications."
"They have the right to make a qualified choice, and this has been achieved to some extent through the conciliation text - but not to such an extent, unfortunately, that we can now talk about a responsible consumer policy."
"Labelling is consumer information, and should be compulsory."
"It should include all types of products, and also indicate the manufacturing process."
"For example, I would not wish to buy, under any circumstances, a foodstuff manufactured from a product to which a gene has been added making it resistant to 'Round Up' , let us say."
"When the day comes that there are such high concentrations of 'Round Up' in our drinking water that we want to prohibit or limit its use, it will be virtually economically impossible for us to do so, simply because we shall then also no longer be able to use the genetically modified plants."
"It is also a major problem that the products do not just have to be manufactured from GMOs, but have to be 'novel' in order to be subject to an authorization procedure."
"So any genetically modified products which are already being marketed fall outside the scope of the regulation."
"Last but not least, I am opposed in principle to giving a blank cheque to the Commission and the committees."
"That is precisely what is happening with this conciliation text."
"Crucial and political decisions are being placed beyond the reach of politicians elected by the people."
"It will thus be decided in closed committee meetings when a product manufactured from GMOs differs to a substantial degree from the conventional product, and how and whether these products should be labelled."
"Given the demand for information and openness in all procedures, the Danish members of our group will be voting against the conciliation text, in spite of the great efforts made by the Conciliation Committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost exactly ten months ago, we voted on Parliament's amendments to the 'novel foods' regulation at second reading."
"Certainly, not all the amendments which many Members wished to see were adopted."
"Nevertheless, I should like to begin today by congratulating Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the creativeness and ingenuity with which she has managed to extract the best possible result for consumers from the proposals that went to the Conciliation Committee."
"I think that Parliament can be proud of this outcome, especially when we consider how little we started with."
"I should like to make two points concerning labelling."
"Firstly, the presence of all genetically modified organisms in foodstuffs, whether derived from an 'agronomic' or any other kind of modification, will now have to be indicated on the label. This represents a substantial change from the Council's common position."
"Secondly, the requirement to label genetically modified ingredients - and note that I refer to ingredients as well as organisms - will be based on proof of their difference from conventional ingredients."
"This is a very significant point, since the fact that the list of procedures by which such proof may be furnished is not exhaustive leaves broad scope for development, something which is very important for consumers."
"My final point is that Article 14 now provides for the Commission to monitor the long-term impact of the regulation on the development of the internal market, as well as on consumer protection and public health. This will supply us with a great deal more information on the effects of these novel foods on human beings."
"Mr President, let me begin by offering sincere congratulations to Mrs RothBehrendt."
"And why?"
"I know how things went with the directive on distance selling."
"As rapporteur, you did not have the good fortune to have a Commissioner who worked with you."
"No, it was rather a case of Mr Bangemann working against Parliament."
"So I would congratulate you on the result which has been achieved."
"That is my first point."
"Secondly, six amendments were tabled at the time."
"You were unhappy that we in the PPE Group did that."
"However, I think the hatchet might now be buried, since when you were given the full support of the PPE Group to have these six amendments carried, you did indeed secure that, although that too was no easy matter."
"So congratulations are in order once again."
"I have just heard Mrs Breyer and Mr Weber reading out a text and acting as if consumers were being deceived here."
"I would very much like to ask Mr Weber, who comes from another of the Benelux countries, to come to the Netherlands and see how this works."
"Precisely what the consumer organizations have done there is included here in the legislation we are proposing."
"So this is not deceiving consumers, but ensuring that at least something positive is done."
"There are three key words."
"The first is safety."
"We have learned some good lessons from the BSE affair."
"So I think it is essential that the agronomic characteristics, for which an exception was made at first, are now included in the regulation."
"The second is information."
"Information is necessary so that consumers can make a proper choice."
"That information is now being provided."
"No further exceptions are possible, so that consumers - and the Greenpeace study showed this - know what they are eating."
"A third point, and here I have some concerns, like Mrs Roth-Behrendt, is what is now going to happen with flavourings and extracts."
"This has still not been resolved, and some adjustments will be needed here."
"Mr President, I too should like to echo the thanks expressed by various honourable Members to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the efforts she has made, even though I do not share her conclusions at all."
"We are being asked to vote tomorrow on the amended text of the draft Regulation, which has had a varied career, and I personally should like to dispel any possible misunderstanding between us: we are not giving an opinion on the work done by the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, because in my view its room for manoeuvre was inadequate for it to have any hope of success."
"We are being asked to give an opinion on the finished product, and that finished product is not acceptable to us."
"It is not acceptable for various reasons. First, it is clear that certain substances used in food processing, especially enzymes, are not covered at all by legislation."
"Nor do we have any legal guarantee as to what legislation will be applied to solvents, additives and colorants."
"Finally, regarding risk assessment, we know from the text before us that many foodstuffs produced via genetic technologies will merely have to be notified to the Commission."
"At the time they are marketed, there will be no authorization procedure."
"That in itself is sufficient, in our view, to make the text inadequate."
"But there is more!"
"The labelling provisions are not adequate either. Some progress seems to have been made, but there are still many uncertainties in that famous Article 8 on which we have spent so much debating time."
"And those uncertainties will, of course, allow too much room for manoeuvre on the part of the Commission, which, we have every reason to believe, is much more concerned with the functioning of the single market than it is with consumer safety."
"The bottom line, I believe, is that everything is now ready for the use of genetic engineering in food to become commonplace."
"When I say 'commonplace' , what I mean is that legislation designed to regulate the use of genetic engineering is becoming weaker and weaker."
"That seems unacceptable to me, since we know that there are still plenty of grey areas, especially as regards the long-term effects."
"I should like to see the real lessons of mad cow disease being learned, and I must admit to being somewhat surprised at the prevailing optimism on this subject in this House. What conclusions should we draw?"
"First, that the principle of safety first was not applied, that there was a total lack of transparency regarding the activities of the experts, and finally that there was an equally total lack of consumer information."
"Yet these were elementary requirements that would have enabled the BSE crisis to be averted."
"So, please, do let's try not to rush straight ahead into a 'mad salmon' crisis."
"We, at least, cannot agree to go down that road."
"We prefer to see no short-term legislation: better to have a legal vacuum for the moment if it leads to better legislation later!"
"Mr President, I wish to commend to the House this compromise arrived at by the conciliation committee on novel foods."
"The compromise is essentially one in which Parliament has recognized the technical realities associated with this directive on labelling and the Council has accepted the right of people to know what is in the food they eat."
"Development of genetic modification by technology has generally brought about the need for this directive and whilst public acceptance and the obvious usefulness of the beneficial effects of biotechnology in other sectors like medicine and pharmaceuticals is now clear, this is not immediately the case when it comes to plant and animal biotechnology or genetically engineered food."
"It is argued by some that the commercial use and release of genetically modified seeds could be harmful to both other plants and human health."
"These concerns, along with the economic and social aspects of biotechnology, pose new problems to policymakers."
"For these reasons we have striven to obtain a labelling system which ensures that consumers will know what they are eating and are able to make a free consumer choice."
"We have sought to ensure that there is as high a level of information as possible while remaining practicable and enforceable."
"The main lessons for the people seeking to exploit the new biotechnologies are clear to me."
"Only an open dialogue with the consumer and a combined effort by industry and science to be as open and honest as possible will create the atmosphere in which consumer confidence allows these products to be acceptable."
"I commend this proposal to the House confident that it is a step forward by the European Parliament to realize the wishes of the consumers in the European single market."
"Mr President, this Regulation will be a fig-leaf to industry."
"After this, it will be possible to say that everything in the garden is lovely as far as consumer protection is concerned and that we need no longer worry when we sit down to dinner."
"But this is far from the truth."
"Mr Bangemann, could you say why the safety assessments of novel foods are not public?"
"I consider this a flagrant insult to consumers."
"Mr Eisma, it is quite clear that some Member States will have to weaken their legislation."
"It is therefore wrong to say that the Greens are irresponsible for not intending to support the adoption of this Regulation."
"A large proportion of genetically modified foods will not be marked as such, although many people do not want to vote through their wallets in favour of the production of such foods."
"Fortunately it will remain possible for the vigilant consumer to buy products marked 'not produced with the aid of genetic modification' ."
"But the biggest mystery, Mr President, is who really needs genetically modified food."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the conciliation procedure is a resounding slap in the face for Commissioner Bangemann."
"He wished to prevent the labelling of genetically manipulated or modified products."
"Mr Bangemann should look at a packet of condoms sometime."
"It says: length, over 170 mm; diameter, 33 mm; thickness, 0.07 mm."
"I doubt that a loving couple would be interested in the length, diameter and thickness of a condom."
"I am quite sure, however, that everyone has a right to precise information about the origin and characteristics of their food."
"They wish to know and ought to know what they are buying."
"With the compromise achieved on the 'novel foods' regulation, we have recognized the maturity of consumers and ensured their freedom of choice when shopping."
"That is as it should be."
"We should therefore approve the amended regulation by a large majority tomorrow, so that we finally get a foot in the door and can make further progress on this issue."
"Mr President, the debate we are holding today is, as we know, the final chapter in a long series of negotiations."
"There are still some opponents in the House, fortunately not many of them, who like to present this issue as if we were dealing with a contrast between the interests of the internal market and those of consumer protection."
"Well, that is not the case."
"The result was worth the difficulty of the negotiations."
"It is a success for the consumer and for Parliament, which has ensured that gaps in the scope of the regulation and in terms of labelling have been eliminated."
"This issue has confronted us with a number of fundamental choices."
"The first is whether to allow or prohibit these novel foods."
"Nowhere in the world is there a general ban, and nor is it desirable."
"It shuts the door on positive scientific applications and developments."
"So there is only one alternative - to allow them - and then the question arises of the extent to which we have to measure out this freedom."
"Clearly, the present situation of total freedom is a bad option, not least for the consumer."
"Today, consumers can only assert their rights after the event, through the rules on liability."
"Otherwise, they are left out in the cold."
"In the joint draft text, the consumer is protected in two ways."
"The products which are placed on the market are subject to strict authorization procedures; and, secondly, the extensive but proper demands of consumers for information are being met."
"Through these rules, biotechnology is being given justified opportunities, without the public health risks being underestimated."
"The consumer is being provided with information, and the fact that we have played a part in this can only highlight our role in consumer protection."
"I hope that the text will be adopted by a very large majority in the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I hope that we will never have cause to regret the tide of optimism on which this measure seems to be likely to go through the European Parliament."
"I regard this as one of the most important pieces of European Union law that we will have before us this year."
"It will affect the food we eat and conceivably, the future of mankind on earth."
"I am one of the optimists who sees genetic technology as offering us hope, not only of increased food supplies, but also a decreased use of pesticides and herbicides in food production."
"But I have some misgivings."
"I strongly believe that as representatives of the people of Europe it is our duty to remain vigilant and to see that this law, which in some places is rather sketchy - as I am sure the rapporteur herself will admit - actually works, with all the necessary safeguards for the health of the people of Europe in place."
"There are at the moment, as I understand it, some eight pending approvals of genetically-modified products before the European Commission."
"And there are some 40 genetically-modified products placed on the market outside Europe at the moment."
"I imagine that we can see the likelihood of those 40 products being brought before us in Europe for approval before very long."
"There are two things in particular MEPs will need to do once this legislation is on the statute book."
"First, we need to monitor exactly how genetically-modified foods are labelled."
"This must not be so opaque that the provisions of Article 8 are meaningless."
"Secondly, MEPs need to penetrate the secret workings of the two vital European Union committees: the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs and the Scientific Committee for Food."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection's experience of them is very unhappy."
"We have never managed any real dialogue with them."
"Yet if you read this regulation, they will play an absolutely key role in deciding whether or not these foods reach our tables."
"I hope, therefore, that Parliament will be able to have a much closer liaison with these committees in the future."
"The report of the Temporary Committee on BSE already points to the need for this."
"Surely BSE and the fact that such a scientific enigma could appear so fast and cause such mayhem should give us pause for thought."
"We do not know everything about the consequences of what we do."
"We must take great care of the health of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, my 80-year-old aunt has assured me that she will never buy genetically modified foods in her life."
"My dynamic young nephew, on the other hand, sees these novel foods as providing the ultimate breakthrough to an age when failed crops, food shortages and famines will be brought to an end throughout the world."
"The fact that the citizens of Europe will actually have the power to exclude a food from the market-place, simply by not buying it, will be thanks to the European Parliament, if it approves this joint text tomorrow."
"Never before have consumers had so great a power; never before will they have been so clearly and comprehensively informed."
"No category of genetically modified foods is excluded from the content of the regulation."
"Anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth!"
"The safety and inspection criteria are clearly set out in the regulation."
"Anyone who claims otherwise is not telling the truth!"
"The regulation specifically provides that producers can advertise their products as being normal foods."
"A fascinating contest will develop: a race for the patronage of consumers."
"Nobody must be afraid that they will eat genetically modified foods in future, if they do not wish to."
"Anyone who claims otherwise is not telling the truth!"
"However, the human urge to explore cannot be prohibited."
"Mankind does not accept closed doors."
"All progress involves risks."
"People must be protected from those risks."
"There can be no compromises in that respect."
"But there have always been courageous people who have dared to seek progress, and who have then achieved it."
"Genetic engineering represents a revolution in medicine."
"Perhaps it can also genuinely help to reduce food shortages and famine."
"It would have been monstrous to have done what the Commission and Council were close to doing - simply depriving consumers of choice."
"Tomorrow's vote will represent a great moment in the history of this Parliament: a victory by Parliament over the Council and Commission!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too believe that this compromise text represents a success for the European Parliament."
"It is of course arguable whether it is a great success or a moderate one."
"I believe that we have secured the key point: whenever a genetically modified organism is present in a food, this must be indicated on the label."
"This will enable consumers, and especially people suffering from allergies, to eliminate any possible risks, however small these may be."
"It is not a question of Russian roulette, Mrs Breyer."
"You are lying in that respect!"
"No one should be seriously claiming that the rejection of this compromise text will lead to a better outcome."
"Rejecting the text would simply produce what the US industry and many of those responsible in the European Union have long desired: no labelling at all."
"And that is undoubtedly the reason why all the European consumer associations are pressing us to approve the compromise text."
"Nor is the frequently drawn comparison with the patenting directive at all helpful, since in that case, firstly, we had a bad compromise text presented to us for a decision; and, secondly, we had the alternative of retaining the concurrent national patent laws for a certain period of time - some two to three years - until a better European law was introduced."
"In this case, the compromise text is the alternative."
"The other option is simply to have no labelling at all, since surely even the Greens do not seriously believe that all 15 national governments and parliaments are suddenly going to introduce rules on labelling."
"I have often defended the Greens, and also Greenpeace, against unjustified criticism."
"Not everything that the Greens and Greenpeace say is nonsense."
"However, I should like to end by saying that the campaign by Greenpeace and the Greens against this compromise text is irresponsible propaganda!"
"If they are successful tomorrow, then the present intolerable situation will be perpetuated: genetically modified soya, maize and other foods will be free to go on supermarket shelves without labelling, and the chance to do something about it will have been lost."
"We must therefore approve this joint text."
"Mr President, this concluding debate has once again shown how difficult it is to reach an agreement in this field which satisfies everyone, since the differences of view - from force feeding to a glorious victory for Parliament - are indeed quite considerable."
"Moreover, it is not a question of who has won or lost in this debate, but of achieving a solution which, on the one hand, meets the legitimate demands of consumers and, on the other, is a viable one - since a solution that delivers nothing is no use to consumers."
"I have said that from the outset."
"I am very pleased that we have achieved a compromise."
"The wording is different from that which we proposed: instead of the criterion of 'significant difference' , a procedure of testing and proof is now being introduced."
"However, it would not have been sensible without such a restriction, as the labelling requirement would have been virtually limitless."
"We have always been in favour of labelling - and I say that to those Members who wrongly and untruthfully claim that we proposed no labelling requirement."
"But we have always said the labelling requirement must be practicable. This means that it must not lead - as the use of biotechnology becomes more widespread - to 80 % to 90 % of foods having to be labelled."
"That would not be in the interest of consumers."
"Then no one would take it seriously."
"We have achieved that objective, though by a different means from that which we proposed."
"I am therefore midway between those who say that this is a major step forward and those - like Mrs Breyer - who say that is worthless."
"I put my faith in the rapporteur."
"That is what I have done throughout the procedure."
"Paragraph 24 of the explanatory statement describes precisely the situation that Parliament will be faced with tomorrow: should it approve a compromise text which does not meet all its wishes - justified or otherwise - or should it settle for nothing?"
"Should it therefore take a first step forward?"
"And indeed, the text on the table is not the end of the story - and not only with regard to enzymes or other substances not yet covered by the regulation, but especially as regards the implementation of the provisions, which will be far from easy."
"After all, this is not a legal text which tells the Commission and the scientific committees exactly - down to the last detail - what to do in each individual case."
"That will not be easy, and I would therefore urge the House to approve this joint text. I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, since this text undoubtedly represents a major step in the right direction."
"And that is what should ultimately be the decisive factor, not whether we have managed to push through absolutely everything that we had in mind, since democracy is not based on individuals being able to be get their way completely, but on people agreeing on things that will improve the lives of everyone."
"Mr President, in the seven and a half years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, I have never had to make a personal statement."
"I try to use such means as little as possible."
"Today, however, I have to do so."
"Given the lateness of the hour, I shall not attempt to respond to the points made by Members who have spoken, or to the speech by the Commissioner."
"I should specifically like to thank the majority of those Members for their comments."
"My personal statement concerns the accusation by Mrs Breyer that, in supporting this compromise text, I am deceiving people, that I am committing a fraud involving consumer safety."
"I would ask for my protest at this accusation to be recorded in the Minutes."
"Mr President, I should also like to make a personal statement. Mr Liese accused me of lying."
"He said that this regulation would not result in a kind of Russian roulette for consumers and people suffering from allergies."
"The opposite is the truth!"
"You know that there are no health criteria."
"But you also know that there are no methods of proof enabling the allergenicity of genetically modified foods to be established in advance."
"At least the American health authorities recognize that."
"In the absence of methods of proof enabling the allergenicity of genetically modified foods to be established in advance, the latter will be placed on the market and tested on consumers."
"This is a particularly serious problem for people suffering from allergies."
"As regards Mrs Roth-Behrendt's allegation, I did not accuse her of lying."
"Mrs Flemming also indirectly criticized those who have doubts about this regulation, who have made it clear that there will not be 100 % labelling of genetically modified foods."
"I gave the example of growth hormones produced by means of genetic engineering."
"Even Mr Bangemann will admit that the use of these cannot be detected and that there are no methods of proof in this instance."
"And yet they are genetically modified products."
"I simply referred to the statement by the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, that this regulation offered total protection."
"I believe, and other speakers have also made this point, that there is no such thing as total protection."
"The relevant criteria do not exist."
"I did not intend - and now Mrs Roth-Behrendt is not listening to me - to make a personal attack on the rapporteur, and I do not believe that I did so with any of my remarks."
"However, it is my right as a Member of Parliament and as a consumer to draw attention here to the fact that there are no health criteria."
"Consequently, it is simply not possible to say that we are ensuring health protection with this regulation."
"I would ask you, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, to name the corresponding health criteria."
"There are none set out in the regulation!"
"I should like to ask Commissioner Bangemann whether he accepts that Article 8 now, as a result of the conciliation, provides for comprehensive labelling but that if, in the light of experience, there prove to be gaps in the system of protection of public health, then consistent with the statement which is being attached to the conciliation agreement, the Commission will come forward to ensure that there will be always comprehensive labelling?"
"Mr President, once again I put a question to Mr Bangemann, and once again he did not answer it."
"I must therefore repeat it: what do you, Mr Bangemann, think about the fact that these safety assessments of genetically modified foods are not being published?"
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"If it will help matters, I shall withdraw the comment that Mrs Breyer was lying, although it does not appear in the script for my speech."
"Nevertheless, I wish to insist on the fact that it is untrue that this regulation will result in a kind of Russian roulette for consumers, and that it is irresponsible propaganda to claim that something better can be secured if the joint text is rejected."
"Mr President, to deal firstly with Mrs Hautala's question, I did not in fact give her a reply because, in view of the limited time available, I did not think that we needed to enter into a further discussion on the substance of the matter."
"The fact that these notifications are not made public is quite normal."
"This is also the practice with other kinds of application which the Commission has to examine."
"However, they are made public later, since a copy of them is forwarded to the Member States and the scientific committees, so that everyone can inform themselves."
"In other words, we do not oblige applicants to publish their notifications in any official journal, but everything that we do subsequently is published."
"I can only confirm what Mr White said."
"I have already said this in response to the rapporteur's request, and it is also set out in Article 14."
"We shall follow everything that happens."
"There will be comprehensive monitoring of all developments."
"If any loopholes become apparent, we shall draw the necessary conclusions and bring forward new proposals."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Cross-border credit transfers"
"The next item is the report (A4-0004/97) by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Decision on cross-border credit transfers (C4-0660/96-94/0242(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Peijs)."
"Mr President, the Conciliation Committee, on which I sat as rapporteur, endorsed the joint draft text of the directive on cross-border credit transfers."
"If the European Parliament does the same this week we shall have this directive in the bag at last."
"The result is something with which Parliament can be pleased. The Member States have to implement the directive by 1 January 1999, the completion date of EMU."
"Germany expects problems with the timing and has promised in a separate declaration to do its utmost to meet the deadline."
"We appreciate its difficulties."
"What exactly is the aim of the directive?"
"Over time a degree of confusion has arisen about this and I will explain it briefly if I may."
"The aim of the objective is to improve the services which handle cross-border credit transfers by making them more efficient."
"This is of course most important in preparation for stage three of Economic and Monetary Union."
"As a result of the single market and very shortly now the Euro the volume of cross-border transfers is steadily increasing, both the number of transactions and their value."
"To maximize the benefits of the single market it is essential that business and industry, and specifically medium- and small-scale undertakings, should be able to effect transfers between the various parts of the Community reliably and cheaply."
"Until such time as this is guaranteed a major obstacle persists to the free movement of goods and services within the Community."
"For the man in the street the directive will put an end to all the aggravation caused by double charging and often high costs, lengthy transfer times and the impossibility of legal redress if the transfer fails to go through."
"The directive applies to all transfers of less than 50 000 ECU and provides primarily for a procedure which seeks to improve the transparency of costs and the speed and reliability of transfers."
"I think the information covered by the directive is the essence of the directive."
"An institution has to provide the customer with sufficient information both before and after a transfer is made and Member States must put in place appropriate and effective complaints and redress procedures to settle any disputes."
"I think it is a very good thing for our citizens to know where they can obtain satisfaction."
"Double charging will be prohibited in future."
"If something still goes wrong with the transfer, the institution of the originator is obliged to credit the originator, that is to say the institution's customer, with a sum not exceeding 12 500 ECU in respect of the amount of the crossborder transfer, plus the interest which the customer has lost and any costs incurred."
"All this within a period of 14 banking days, naturally once the period agreed between originator and bank has expired."
"Of course every originator, every customer of the bank, is entitled to go to law in his own country to recover the rest of the money."
"So this directive seeks to achieve greater transparency and greater reliability and speed in cross-border transfers."
"Once greater transparency and clarity has been secured, the price will fall too."
"In fact we are already seeing the effect of the imminent introduction of the directive."
"Many banks - I see it in the Netherlands, and I see it in Germany - have already introduced a Euro-transfer which already meets the directive's requirements."
"So it is fair to say that this is an important directive which will improve the freedom of movement in goods and services in the Community."
"The end result now before us is a very good one overall."
"When we began the conciliation procedure the wishes of the European Parliament and the Council were still rather different."
"I welcome the fact that both sides have moderated their stance somewhat and that the main differences have been resolved."
"What were those differences?"
"For example the applicability threshold, now 50 000 ECU, so all transfers of less than 50 000 ECU are subject to the directive; the mandatory refund amount: 12 500 ECU, and the date of the directive's entry into force."
"Thus, on the first day of full EMU this directive will also come into force."
"We hope in Germany too, but maybe it will take a little longer there."
"We have a directive which protects consumers and businesses adequately and will encourage internal trade in goods and services within the Community."
"In the name of Parliament and the voters we represent I call on Member States to comply as swiftly as possible with the requirements contained in this directive which serves the best interest of all citizens and businesses in Europe."
"Mr President, the cross-border credit transfers directive is good news for Europe, good news for its citizens, good news for small businesses and good news for the European Parliament."
"Why?"
"First of all, as regards citizens and consumers: everyone of us has at sometime or other tried to send money across national boundaries."
"Climbing the north face of the Eiger might have been easier."
"Recall how the faces drop behind the counter when you go into your local bank and announce, as I once did, that you want to send money from England to France to pay for a holiday."
"Lack of enthusiasm is followed by lack of information about how such a transaction might be effected, what the costs are, how long the transfer will take, and what guarantees you have that the money will not be lost as it wings its way across the Channel."
"Remember your astonishment that both the sending and the receiving bank want their cut in commission for performing this elementary task in the electronic age."
"It is time double-charging was singled out for the chop, and so it will be through the instrument of this directive."
"We in the Socialist Group would be particularly keen to protect the consumer by ensuring a pay-back guarantee of up to ECU 12, 500 on any such transaction."
"The biggest boost for the consumer, however, will reside in the demand for transparency in bank costs and conditions of transfer."
"Information posted up-front will truly permit the customer to shop around for the cheapest and best service."
"Competition will shed light on the gloomy and cobwebbed world of the high street banks and sweep away the delays habitually associated with such transactions."
"So frustrated was my constituent, Mrs Dorothy Evans of Ellesmere Port, in sending cash transfers to Sweden for her magazine subscriptions that she resorted to sending Kroner notes in the post."
"Help is at hand Dorothy!"
"Good news too for SMEs whose fear of sending money abroad can inhibit them from functioning fully and effectively in Europe's single market."
"Why risk profits when a credit transfer to buy goods or services wipes out the incentive to trade across borders?"
"Playing it safe virtually means: ' don't play at all in the single market' ."
"Good news for the European Parliament and congratulations to Mrs Peijs for her persistence with the Council."
"By invoking the conciliation procedure and arriving at a sensible compromise with the Council we have shown Parliament capable and cunning in the deployment of its new conciliation powers."
"Once again the European Parliament is manifesting itself as of the people, by the people and for the people."
"One final thought: the greater transparency introduced into the act of sending money from one country to another will itself be all the more apparent once the single currency is introduced."
"No longer will banks include conversion charges in their total fees."
"Even better, the true costs of the service provided will be laid bare."
"Truly the spotlight of healthy competition will fall on the dark vaults of European banks."
"This directive will also be good news for banks which will become more competitive in Europe's great enterprise, the single European market."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating you on your re-election and wishing you all the very best."
"As we know, there are some 400, 000, 000 cross-border credit transfers in the European Union annually, and 50 % of individual transfers amount to less than ECU 2, 500."
"On the basis of current trends, it is estimated that, in the early years of the next century, the total number of cross-frontier banking transactions, excluding cash payments, will be in excess of one billion."
"That will be the product of an increase in cross-border activity and the expansion of trade in goods, services and money between the Member States, within the single market."
"It is therefore becoming crucial that we encourage regulatory measures which protect citizens as the consumers of banking services, whether we are talking about small or big business or just savers."
"That aim is fully compatible with the introduction and circulation of the single currency."
"A banking transaction between two different cities within the Community should be treated in the same way as a transaction between two different cities in the same state, and management of those transactions should not be left entirely to the discretion of the credit institutions, that leaving them to determine transaction procedures, monetary value and costs."
"We therefore approve of a large part of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee and shall be supporting it."
"For that, I thank the rapporteur above all and, I venture to say - the French government which made this one of its priorities during its presidency, in the first half of 1995, when it reached agreement with the governments of almost all of the Member States and with this House, which gave its support, firmly convinced that what we want is not a Europe of bankers but a Europe of citizens."
"To begin with, Mr President, our group was rather critical of the amounts involved and worked very hard to try to get the amounts to which the directive will be applicable increased."
"Nevertheless I believe the result we now have is to be applauded and together with my fellow-Members here I must compliment Mrs Peijs on her achievement."
"Our Group believes that it is extremely important that the rights of consumers and small businesses should be adequately protected, at least up to given maximum sums."
"But I strongly believe that the banks themselves might offer rather more by way of guarantees and security in their contracts with their clients."
"If we want a single Europe and a single market, there have to be guarantees for credit transfers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate I mistakenly did not use up nearly all my speaking time."
"So I hope you will bear with me if I use a little more than my allotted time now."
"On the business in hand: more would have been better."
"But I think that in the Conciliation Committee we did achieve something for the people who elected us."
"Although the original proposal has been improved, there is still one aspect that worries me, however. The liability thresholds have been set too low."
"That means that a financial risk that could under certain circumstances prove to be a question of economic survival is being shifted from the economically stronger to the economically weaker parties."
"Fortunately, legislative rules do not apply for ever."
"At the appropriate time they can be improved."
"And I hope our counterparts in the Council will keep to their word."
"They promised in the Conciliation Committee that they will not insist on the 30-month time-limit for implementing the directive, so that where possible it can be incorporated into national legislation everywhere by 1 January 1999."
"In the hope that the directive will be reviewed in the near future to provide greater consumer protection, I think we ought to approve the outcome of the conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which was asked for its opinion, naturally expected the directive to do more to protect consumers."
"Yet I approved it in the Conciliation Committee and would now ask Parliament to do the same."
"We need a directive on cross-border credit transfers and I hope that as promised the Member States will implement it by 1 January 1999, i.e. on the date of monetary union."
"Parliament managed to carry through its demand that the directive should take account of any transfer below ECU 50 000."
"That means it covers the majority of transfers to the private sector and the SMEs."
"The mandatory refund amount for transfers that are debited from the sender's account but not credited to the receiver's account, namely ECU 12 500, is a compromise that will have to be improved on when the directive is reviewed."
"During the conciliation procedure it sometimes seemed as though the Council believed we were still living in the days of the stagecoach and the money was being carried in cash."
"It would be most welcome if the banks voluntarily agreed to increase the amount."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I should like to thank Parliament for its efforts to ensure that the conciliation procedure produced the results which have permitted this compromise between the three institutions."
"This has also made it clear that the conciliation procedure is sometimes a positive thing and a method that is quite capable, via the inter-institutional dialogue, of producing good news such as this."
"I think that Mrs Peijs described at length the agreement reached in the conciliation procedure, and most of the Members who took part in the debate have made clear the benefits which consumers, individuals and undertakings will enjoy once this directive is approved."
"Therefore you will pardon me if I do not reiterate the results of the conciliation process."
"I think that the benefits are obvious."
"There was a demand for this, above all from those who, as explained by the various Members, use this type of service."
"The situation now is much more clear."
"It is much more transparent for citizens and, furthermore, what is more important - and I will finish with this remark - it is a positive step towards gradually reinforcing the border-free internal market."
"Thank you, Mrs Peijs, for your explanations, thanks to all of you and also thanks to the conciliation procedure which has enabled this positive decision to be taken today."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"EU-Latin America partnership"
"The next item is the report (A4-0416/96) by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament 'The European Union and Latin America - the present situation and prospects for closer partnership 1996-2000' (COM(95)0495 - C4-0489/95)."
"Mr President, before we begin the debate on the Bertens report, I should like to draw your attention to a procedural matter: we are about to debate two reports by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy but we have yet to hear the opinions of either the Delegation for relations with Latin America or the Delegation for relations with Central America."
"It may be that as far as the rules are concerned, that omission is justified; but I believe that, looking at the substance, that is the way in which our work is managed, it is right that the views of those delegations with an interest in the issue should be heard in these instances."
"Therefore, Mr President, if you consider my point to be justified, perhaps the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities could look at the matter to establish the actual function of the parliamentary delegations within the structure of our work."
"Mr Manzella, I am sorry, but there are members of those delegations who can table amendments before tomorrow's vote, and that should satisfy your requirements."
"I do not think the debate can be postponed since the members of the delegations have that right."
"Mr President, I did not ask for referral back to committee."
"I simply asked whether you thought we should continue the debate and refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities so that it can study, can examine the role the delegations should in future play in these areas."
"It seems to me incompatible with the way in which the work of the House is managed that the delegations concerned with the issue of Latin America should not be involved."
"It was only a point for the future, Mr President, I was not seeking referral back to committee."
"Mr Manzella, I will put your request to the President."
"Mr President, speaking personally and on behalf of my Group I must congratulate you on your reelection as vice-president of Parliament."
"My thanks to Mr Manzella for stressing that the delegation on Latin America needs to address this report. Let me reassure him;"
"I was a member of it for seven and a half years, it does a good job, and moreover I spent fifteen years of my short life living in the region we are discussing."
"Anyway, we shall be talking about this in more detail, I am a Dutchman and you are an Italian and maybe we can communicate in another way."
"My thanks to the Commission and above all to Commissioner Mar√≠n for the statement on future relations with Latin America."
"That continent is changing fast and it is vital for the Union to have a coherent vision embracing all aspects of our relations with it."
"Europeans are still over-inclined to view Latin America with the prejudices of the seventies and eighties."
"Latin America is no longer a continent of dictators, human rights violations, massive inflation and of interesting but oh so secret contras or contra-contras."
"That is partly thanks to Europe."
"The Union has since the early eighties shown here how a common European foreign policy can be successful."
"Mr Mar√≠n knows that better than anyone, the San Jos√© dialogue."
"Mr Carnero, another old Latin America hand, has written a very good report on it."
"In it he describes how the common European foreign policy, which must not be institutionalized, can work."
"And we must now build on this success."
"Meantime Europe stood still whilst Latin America was rapidly changing."
"A policy of reconciliation, democratization and respect for human rights provided the basis for political and social stability."
"Economic reform and macroeconomic stabilization created opportunities for economic reconstruction."
"These developments lent a powerful impetus to regional cooperation, the Andean Pact, Mercosur and so on."
"But, again, Europe did not match these advances and failed to seize many of the opportunities afforded by these recent developments."
"Cooperation was one-sided in the form of development cooperation."
"We gradually lost the Latin American market to the United States which jumped in with NAFTA and the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative and plugged the gap which Europe had left."
"The US is currently way ahead of Europe in terms of investment in and trade with Latin America."
"New structures in Latin America remain fragile."
"35 % of the population are below the poverty threshold."
"Not enough is done on education and training."
"Drugs, corruption and crime which goes unpunished undermine the political structures in Latin America."
"We need to continue focusing on democratization."
"A new peace in Guatemala is a most welcome fact, but it will of course remain weak unless we help to underpin it."
"Europe must deal with Latin America as a fully-fledged mature partner."
"The Commission statement is a beginning."
"We cannot allow so important a region with its still fragile structures to be ignored by the common foreign and security policy."
"But the Commission's moves towards a new Latin America policy are too vague and too loose."
"I urge the Commission to prepare a programme of action, proposing specific initiatives as part of a new policy."
"In my report I suggest a number of specific initiatives of this kind."
"They cover foreign policy, the economy, integration, development cooperation, security and defence."
"In terms of foreign policy Latin America must be seen as a priority area."
"We must not convert the transatlantic dialogue we have with the United States and Canada into a transatlantic dialogue with Latin America."
"But Latin America must feature prominently on our agenda."
"The Union must continue to foster regional integration on economic and other matters and must maintain contacts with these regions."
"I agree with the Commission's priorities for development cooperation."
"As the biggest donor the Union must encourage all other countries to intensify their efforts."
"The contribution of the US in particular is too modest."
"Security and defence. But I will take security and cooperation on drugs together."
"Cooperation on drugs must be broadened to parts of Latin America other than the countries of the Andean Pact alone."
"Security and defence must also feature in the dialogue between Europe and Latin America."
"In a truly mature relationship with Latin America these topics too must be discussed."
"Cooperation on preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and the like are matters for the world community."
"So contacts between appropriate organizations are a very good idea too."
"Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee of which I am the draftsman, I will refer, naturally enough, to the energy, research and development aspects."
"With regard to Latin America, we are talking about a market of 450 million inhabitants."
"Thus 450 million consumers."
"Mr Bertens said that the European Union had neglected these markets."
"Not in relation to energy, Mr Bertens."
"Many of the European Union Member States have made considerable investments in the field of energy."
"I think that the investments they have made are so significant that they have become the real protagonists in this area in recent years."
"This enormous region, which is enjoying substantial economic growth, has a low level of economic development, thus there is scope for a major increase in energy consumption."
"Our committee is anxious to ensure that the energy will be used efficiently."
"There is already the ALURE programme (Optimal Use of Energy Resources in Latin America) launched by Commission Directorate General I concerning cooperation between Latin America and the European Union, which is important but not sufficient."
"It is not properly funded."
"We need more resources for this programme, Commissioner, because we consider it to be extremely important."
"We also consider that renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectric energy, should be developed. It has enormous development potential in Latin America."
"This energy source does not cause pollution, unlike others."
"Moreover we have the Amazonian rainforests which drain off a huge amount of carbon dioxide."
"This should all be exploited in our future cooperation based on the relevant agreements."
"As for the most active role we should develop in the area of research and development, we have proposed that seminars be organised to exchange views on mutual cooperation, exchanges of research staff and the launching of programmes in the area of food technology, biotechnology, energy and, above all, the environment."
"Mr President, we are dealing with a very important report - this is the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"It is high time that the European Union started to regard Latin America as it does other American nations, such as the United States of America and Canada."
"The rapporteur rightly highlights the fact that our relations have already overcome their rather hesitant beginnings and are now turning into mature relations between regional organizations with a will to ensure understanding."
"We are determined to ensure understanding because we have similar cultures which have been brought closer together with the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union."
"While there is a traditional understanding between Latin America on the one hand and Spain and Portugal on the other, similar to that between the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom, the Community has perhaps not responded to Latin America in the same way."
"Support must be reflected in a strengthening of the various bodies which can ensure that this understanding becomes something quite natural."
"I am referring to organisations such as the European Investment Bank, the ECIP and AL-Invest, from which I infer directly that the European Union is in favour of the development aid being granted."
"The EU is in fact the leading donor - 54 % compared with less than half this figure granted by the United States."
"Despite this, however, we note that not only are European investments in these countries not increasing, but they are actually diminishing."
"The United States of America accounts for 43 % of global trade and 75 % of direct foreign investment."
"Why is there such an imbalance here and why are we not in fact on an equal footing with the US?"
"I applaud the report, and I wish to say that the Committee on Development and Cooperation supports these steps to intensify and normalise relations with Latin America."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Fellow Members, I was interested to read the text of the report produced by Mr Bertens and the opinions of the various committees which contributed to shaping it."
"In my view these are useful and interesting texts which attempt to put forward ideas on how to reinforce relations between the European Union and Latin America."
"Looking at the situation in Latin America today, it is obvious that it is not, as Mr Bertens said a moment ago, the same situation as in the last few decades."
"It is a much more complex, more active world, with good things and bad, but also with enormous possibilities."
"A world where identities are shared, yet it is not right to try to reduce Latin America to some vague kind of uniformity, forgetting the differences."
"Latin America is an emerging Chile, a Nicaragua with very severe poverty levels; it is Guatemala which is concluding a peace agreement, and Costa Rica which is a real example of democratic stability."
"It is also true that Latin America is Colombia with flashpoints of violence linked to drugs trafficking, and Peru where we are witnessing the unacceptable use of violence and hostage-taking as political instruments."
"But it is also Mercosur, an ambitious project, and the Free Trade Treaty with Mexico, Canada and the United States."
"I think that the European Union must adopt a global approach to its relations with Latin America which appreciates the very plurality of this continent."
"We have political dialogue instruments."
"One example is the San Jos√© dialogue which Commissioner Marin is also developing, but perhaps it is not enough."
"We cannot accept the risk of Latin America continuing to regard the United States as a priority and the European Union as just a faithful companion."
"It is very useful to know about the evolution of investments and trade flows between the European Union and Latin America in order to embark on an analysis of the potential prospects for the future. We have a lot of ground to cover if we are to discover all the potential of parliamentary dialogue."
"For instance, if political cooperation between the European Union and Latin America is important, why is it in many cases reduced to a ministerial or governmental dialogue? Parliamentary dialogue is useful in the context of consolidating democracy and establishing regional integration."
"Latin America and the European Union need each other, and on the basis of an equal footing and with commitment to a climate of cooperation, they need to reinforce the instruments of political and trade cooperation."
"Anyone who has examined or witnessed the cooperation between the European Union and Latin America will have discovered that cooperation takes place on a large scale and yet - the Commission is also aware of this - this is often not very visible to citizens wishing to determine the levels of cooperation."
"Another problem that most of the Latin American countries suffer from is the burden of debt."
"The European Union must become an active partner capable of formulating and submitting coordinated, innovative proposals to alleviate the burden of external debt of Latin American countries."
"Because, in most cases, these are countries with very divided societies which need help to carry out economic reforms capable of reducing the unemployment figures and the poverty figures. Economic reforms which will create the conditions needed for consolidation or even, in some cases, for the introduction of collective policies based on solidarity, similar to what we in Europe call 'the welfare state' ."
"Some Latin American countries have very serious drug trafficking and corruption problems, but we dare not raise a hypocritical accusatory finger until we can deal rigorously with this, because the coca being produced would not be converted into drugs unless there were was a demand for these."
"I will finish, Mr President, by saying that the age of military dictatorships has now virtually ended, but there may be a risk of the emergence of another type of populist regime which does not solve the structural problems of Latin America."
"The European Union and Latin America should come together in every possible area of cooperation."
"The Commission's proposals and the contribution by Mr Bertens are a step in this direction."
"Mr President, when people talk about Europe's relations with Latin America they can never be sure what past or present family affairs they may be interfering in."
"There are disputes, talks, deals and criticisms."
"There are sisters, brothers, cousins, godparents, relationships that have endured for decades or centuries, refuges and enterprising immigrants and emigrants."
"But what we are concerned with today is the future, namely the attempt to revive the relations between the EU community of states and Latin America, marked by years of conflict between dictatorship and democracy, the fight for human rights and the construction of common markets in Latin America, by creating a partnership until the year 2000."
"That is important to our common foreign policy and our foreign trade policy alike."
"It affects them both."
"In our view and in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, as set out in Mr Bertens' very good report, the EU must pursue both policies with a view to initiating a new transatlantic dialogue, which must also involve the United States."
"Since its direct election, the European Parliament has endeavoured for many years to promote this dialogue."
"Article J.1 of the Maastricht Treaty calls for a dynamic policy towards Latin America."
"That had long been lacking."
"Developments in Europe led to a decline in interest in the political processes in Latin America."
"In spite of its undisputed economic and democratic upswing in the 1990s, Latin America has to some extent taken a back place in international politics."
"With its Communication on 'The European Union and Latin America - the present situation and prospects for closer partnership 1996-2000' the Commission has pointed the way to reviving these relations."
"The opinions of the two committees consulted, the continuous activities of the delegations for South and Central America, the interparliamentary dialogue in the framework of the EP-Latin American Parliament interparliamentary conferences all show how much importance we attach to the proposals set out in the resolution."
"We have strongly supported the development of Mercosur, the formation of regional parliaments in Central America, the Andean parliament, the Central American parliament."
"But we must not forget some important questions."
"We must not forget drugs, cross-border crime and corruption, the expansion of trade in sensitive sectors, the struggle for greater human rights and democracy."
"Last year's hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on impunity for the crimes against humanity committed in dictatorships against political opponents but also against many ordinary people who happened to be in the wrong place, showed the complex and sensitive nature of these problems inherited from the past."
"Democracy and an independent judiciary are closely interlinked."
"A democratic Europe must support the stabilization of democracy in order to increase the number of democratic states in the international organisations and formulate a common security and defence policy, with a view to conflict-prevention."
"It is our duty to do so and we in the European Parliament have always insisted on this to the Commission and the Council."
"We wish the report much success."
"Mr President, current developments in Latin America are one of the happiest trends of the last years of this century."
"Long regarded as a powder keg, a theatre of endless guerrilla warfare and putsches, Latin America is now seeing real progress towards peace and democracy, a process which the European Union must support and help to strengthen."
"Like Mr Bertens, whom I congratulate on his excellent report, I welcome the Commission's initiative and the tone of its communication, designed to reestablish good relations between the European Union and Latin America."
"In the brief time allowed me, I cannot - much as I approve of them - go into the three main priorities on which the Commission proposes to base the Union's cooperation."
"I shall therefore confine myself to stating what I believe to be the essential prerequisite for any reform - the support which Europe can and must give to the consolidation of the democratic process."
"The European Union is often accused of being first and foremost an economic union, motivated by trade interests."
"This view takes no account of its contribution to the spread of democracy throughout the world, through the conclusion of cooperation and association agreements with countries where democracy was or had been under threat."
"This is the situation with the Latin American continent, where some democratic regimes are still fragile and where the Union can made a decisive contribution to strengthening the processes taking place."
"The Commission's proposals regarding the establishment of a political and trading partnership between the Union and the Latin American countries meet this requirement."
"However, there are two points in the report about which I have certain misgivings."
"First, Mr Bertens proposes to go beyond the ministerial framework within which such dialogues take place - he would like to see more inter-parliamentary meetings organized, with the European Parliament and its Latin American counterparts participating in the ministerial meetings."
"This may create undesirable institutional confusion at a time when links that had previously been somewhat stretched are being reestablished."
"Secondly, there is the fight against the narcotics trade."
"In his explanatory statement, Mr Bertens suggests that the problem of the drug trade is a matter of supply and demand, and that the first need is to create the right conditions for other forms of development, without launching an outright war on drugs because suppression, as he puts it, never works."
"This way of looking at the problem worries me, because although it is true that there is a need to create other forms of development in the areas where these products are cultivated, it is equally true that the drug trade must be obstructed by every available means, without exception."
"Part of the European Union's mission is to help these countries rid themselves of a scourge that never makes any contribution to the advance of democratic awareness."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the recent years have been marked by a rapprochement between the European Union and Latin America, mainly due to the accession of Spain and Portugal which increased and accentuated the cultural similarities between both continents."
"Therefore we would like to express our agreement with the spirit of Mr Bertens' report. We consider that the essential priority objective must be to extend and reinforce the various activities which promote development and the consolidation of democracy in Latin American countries, as described in the Commission communication also dealing with this matter."
"To do this we consider it vital to reinforce European efforts to bolster the economic reforms of the Latin American countries, thus ensuring the success of the structural reform currently under way and promoting the development and progress of the various Latin American regions, paying particular attention to the considerable economic and social disparities in the region."
"To achieve this, we in the European Union must engage in more energetic and ambitious activities to ensure that relations with Latin America become the main objective of the new common foreign and security policy."
"We must remember that, after tripling in the '80s, Latin America's traditional trade surplus with the European Union diminished at the beginning of the '90s, practically disappearing in 1993."
"In the past three years a deficit of some 1500 million dollars was recorded."
"At the same time, the European Union ceased being the main investor in Latin America, which demonstrates that the current efforts to reinforce association with Latin America are not sufficient, and lack the ambition and dynamism needed."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we consider it vital for the Commission to formulate an action programme for Latin America which, as already mentioned, contains practical, common proposals which promote, on the one hand, economic development and, on the other, peace, democracy and the strictest possible respect for human rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bertens's report deals with a communication from the Commission on relations between the European Union and Latin America. This communication is certainly worthy of independent consideration, but it also has to be seen in an overall context that includes the communications on relations with Canada, the United States and Central America."
"This set of texts reflects the European Union's legitimate concern to redefine its relations with the Americas as a whole in the aftermath of the Cold War, and to provide a counter-balance to a powerful zone of economic and trade development centred on the Pacific."
"I welcome the stated intentions regarding efforts to promote development and stamp out the drug trade, the defence of social justice and the environment, and the restoration of closer cultural links."
"But I am concerned when our ACP partners warn us of the long-term erosion of the Lom√© agreements by the granting of trade preferences here, there and everywhere, and especially of the devastating effects of the drugs GSP."
"We know today the undesirable effects of this system, conceived as it was with the best of intentions."
"Not only has it helped to reduce significantly the production of drugs, but it has also, conversely, destroyed whole sectors of European horticulture and fisheries."
"I am also concerned when the development of our trade relations is presented as being necessarily destined to result in an intercontinental free trade area, even though this prospect is at present formulated in somewhat vague terms."
"If the Commission's real intention is to implement a package of trade and customs agreements creating a transatlantic free trade framework which will double the multilateral trade disarmaments of the GATT, it should tell us the reasons, the advantages, the drawbacks, the costs and profits."
"What will the consequences be for employment in Europe?"
"What quid pro quo are we going to ask for?"
"In particular, can we quantify the consequences of such agreements in the agricultural sector when we know the productivity of the South American agricultural sector, its labour costs and its social and environmental standards?"
"It is for all these reasons, Mr President, that the Europe of Nations Group, while acknowledging the quality of the work done by Mr Bertens, will be very vigilant regarding the concrete proposals based upon it by the European Commission."
"Mr President, the scant attention paid in recent years by the European Union to the countries of Latin America again raises the problem of the absence of a general foreign policy strategy for Europe, at least at a political, commercial and security level."
"Admittedly, the Commission communication to Parliament has at least the merit of stating - after years of guilty silence - the need to relaunch the relationship between the European Union and Latin America, and we have to acknowledge that Mr Bertens, the rapporteur, has had the courage to focus clearly on and identify shortcomings and limits in the Commission communication and put forward real and specific solutions."
"It is a serious mistake to view Latin America - and this is what has happened so far - as just one of several partners in discussion on the other side of the world with which we maintain relations typified by programmes that are frequently ill-defined and not particularly innovative."
"Only political short-sightedness could prevent the European Union - and its Member States - from looking to Latin America as a geographical area of major importance, politically and culturally at least."
"I would go so far as to say that, in addition to the strategic reasons, there are historical, cultural and linguistic features which mean that the subcontinent is the most Europeanized area lying between the two Oceans: for generations, millions of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese - to name but a few - have been living in those countries, millions of European emigrants, then, who share with the local people the struggle against poverty and social marginalization."
"And so long as Europe fails to fulfil its role as privileged partner, its place is being rapidly taken by the United States which now accounts for 43 % of trade with Latin America and 75 % of direct inward investment."
"We need then to recover lost time: the Commission and the Council should draw up a global action programme for a common foreign and security policy with Latin America."
"In any event, Europe should register its interest in taking an active role in the development of Latin America."
"In the coming months, we shall see whether the conditions and political will to play that role really exist."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Bertens for his report."
"Both this report and the Commission document fulfil an important function."
"The cooperation which was initiated in the middle of the 1980s, within the framework of the San-Jose dialogue, must be revived and developed."
"The political and economic instruments which have been developed and are now in place must be updated and used so that the Union can support the move towards democracy and the protection of Human Rights which has commenced in the region."
"Fresh steps must be taken to ensure that values and standards in these areas, on both continents, are brought closer together."
"The EU is currently the largest donor of aid to Latin America although, politically speaking, the region is of less importance to Europe now, despite the fact that culturally and ideologically we have grown closer in recent years."
"Some important aspects of the links between the Union and these countries, such as the encouragement of democracy, increased respect for minority groups, concern for the environment, the fight against drug trafficking and international crime, have served to widen and expand the relationship between the two continents."
"Because of this, as the rapporteur has pointed out, there is a need for a deeper political dialogue between the EU and Latin America in order to take advantage of and provide continuing support to these positive developments in the future."
"But I question some of the aspects of cooperation covered in the report."
"To discuss, in this context, the inclusion, in the political dialogue with these countries, of EU security and defence aspects of the cooperation is, in my opinion, a step in the wrong direction."
"It is obvious to me, that the EU supports the international peace movement, and is working to prevent conflict and strengthen democracy."
"As the rapporteur himself mentioned, the best way to do this is to develop a global strategy of economic and political cooperation with these countries."
"I consider it illogical and incorrect that the have to be and should be resolved at international level by a body which has the necessary mandate for this task."
"The report also takes up the question of control over the export of weapons."
"It is very important that this export is restricted."
"A voluntary register has been developed within the UN for the registration of heavy weapons."
"The EU should strive to see this register developed, to make registration obligatory and to see that the register covers all weapons both heavy and light."
"This must be seen as the first step towards a global restriction of the trade in weapons."
"Defence aspects are not within the competence of the EU and consequently must be tackled at interstate level."
"I find it impossible to support the EU's tendency, through its influence on aspects of a region's security and defence, to take upon itself the role of a world police force."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr Bertens on his report because this is one of the few reports in this House which underlines the need not only to reinforce relations with the countries of Latin America, but also to reconsider these relations."
"Mr President, Latin America is the poor relation in the European Union's external policy."
"As I often say, Latin America does not need handouts, it needs opportunities. Of the three vehicles for European Union action in the coming years - political dialogue, cooperation and trade relations - I think that what will mark the direction for developing these relations is political dialogue, with the parliamentary dimension referred to by other colleagues."
"Because it was political and not economic reasons which led to the San Jos√© dialogue; because it was political and not economic reasons which are behind the consolidation of the Rio Group dialogue, and because it is political and not economic reasons which must lay down the guidelines for political transition to democracy in Cuba, with full respect for fundamental rights and liberties, as requested by this Parliament."
"However important this political dialogue is, Mr President, it will end up being reduced to nothing and withering away if it is not accompanied by cooperation action to sustain it."
"I am very happy to see Mr Bertens here because he was also present at the debate with the Dutch presidency, during which no mention at all was made of the Latin American priority."
"When it comes to voting on budgets, I think it very important that we ensure together that enough is done so that the amendments submitted - and I would remind Mr Bertens that the general rapporteur is a member of his Group - will be successful."
"With regard to the trade aspects, I think that the European export figures for 1995 released at the beginning of January are very satisfactory."
"But we are not stimulating production by Latin American countries because, in fact, they are competitive in many products and, in many cases, we are closing our markets to them."
"I think that we should be satisfied by what has been done."
"There is still a lot to be done, however. I reiterate my congratulations to Mr Bertens on his report."
"Mr President, this debate has confirmed that, right now, Latin America is the frontier of the world: what I mean by that is that there is no institutional, economic, social or artistic culture which ought not here and now be taking notice of what was until just a few years ago considered to be the 'missing' continent."
"The way in which the world is interdependent is also plain from the mass of political issues Latin America raises for us."
"There are the two hundred million poor - increasingly poor - people, and yet there is vigorous development over increasingly large areas of the continent."
"There continue to be clusters of nationalism which are frequently the source of serious violations of constitutional principles, and yet there are also experiments in regionalism which are gaining ground. There is, in many instances, a delay in creating a fully-developed legal system, and yet a substantial degree of civil awareness is becoming established."
"We, the European Union, should take full responsibility for these contradictions: we have to understand that the world has become smaller and they are to some extent our contradictions also."
"Firstly, Europe's transatlantic dialogue should be conducted with both North and South America. Secondly, our policy in Latin America should be a global policy, programmed in accordance with the Community approach of objectives, deadlines and resources."
"Thirdly, we should have both a ministerial and an interparliamentary framework, the latter offering civilian populations the opportunity to have a voice and be heard and strengthening and supporting the American regional models, such as MERCOSUR, which are becoming established, through our model of regional parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report and the communication from the Commission."
"I believe it is important to continue expanding relations between the European Union and the Latin American continent to avoid the risk of being edged out of this continent by the United States."
"Moreover, I agree with the rapporteur that in many areas the Commission's communication fails to make any concrete proposals."
"We will urgently need an action plan here in the near future."
"For example, there are no proposals on dealing with the drug problem, which is very acute in these countries."
"That means that the general socio-economic structures have to be improved."
"But a specific programme also needs to be formulated with the aim of substituting alternative crops for narcotics through a specific agricultural development policy."
"I welcome the proposal concerning the importance of information about that continent and mutual understanding, with a view to strengthening the rule of law and involving civil society in the development of a genuine human rights structure."
"My experiences in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and in the South America delegation have shown me how important it is to promote exchanges, especially between young people."
"That is why I would suggest developing the existing programmes of scientific and technical cooperation and aiming them in particular at universities, to give young people and budding scientists a chance to be actively involved in the new partnership and benefit from their mutual experiences."
"In general, we need research on Latin America and a comparative study of European-Latin American development, bringing out both the common features and the differences between the two cultures, so that we can base all our future measures on the findings."
"That is the only way to ensure that Latin American culture is acknowledged and treated as independent."
"Finally, I want to address one other aspect where I think improvements are needed: the much-criticised European bureaucracy makes it difficult for good ideas to be translated into action in this area too."
"It is important to simplify the system of applying for projects and the administration of the research programmes."
"Only then can the applications be processed rapidly and projects be approved quickly."
"Mr President, I should like to join in congratulating Mr Bertens and thank him for incorporating amendments which I moved as part of the Committee on Development and Cooperation's opinion on this report."
"Amendments to ensure the principles of development underpin our relations with all Latin American countries highlighting the very severe social impact of the structural adjustment policies, supporting far greater involvement of civil society in our dialogue and agreements as well as the sensitive question of fair trade access for products of the countries own choosing, not ours."
"I would also like to say how much I agree with the rapporteur's comments on the importance of alternative development as part of combating the drugs problem, and we should wish success to the European-funded alternative development programme in Bolivia announced late last year, the most significant programme yet of its type."
"However, I regret that we have not found priority in tonight's resolution to incorporate two of my other amendments to support specific programmes for women, including reproductive rights, and to reassert our commitment to ILO Convention 169 and to combat the flagrant abuse of the rights of indigenous populations which continue to occur in nearly every country in the region."
"I would also like to support the rapporteur when he questions the Commission on how far vague concepts will be applied in concrete terms."
"In Recital C we say what is the point in democracy and social clauses in our agreements when there appears to be little attempt to monitor and enforce such clauses?"
"In Recital I we call for the protection of the environment and yet Europe is still supporting mass hydro-electric schemes in the name of development, one of which - local communities and NGOs say - will devastate one of the largest and most precious environments within the region."
"There are 200 million people in the region living in poverty."
"How far is this compatible with Commissioner Marin's own statement to the Development Committee on 29 October last year that Mercosur countries have been struck off the development aid list to concentrate on poorer countries like Bolivia and Peru?"
"An apparently wealthy country like Brazil has more poor people than any other country on this planet and Europe cannot be silent on this question."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Bertens for his report which highlights something which the Commission has no difficulty in accepting."
"Anything that will reinforce relations with Latin America, augment the content of these relations, increase the European presence and guarantee the quality and quantity of our political, economic, financial, trade and cultural relations must become quite natural for the European Union, mindful of the historical and cultural links for some and the economic and trade links for others."
"In reality, the Commission's communication concerning the way in which we will conduct our relations in the last five years of the century is simply a practical guide to where our activities should start and end."
"Rather than launching new ideas now about Latin America, what the Commission intends to do is consolidate the enormous amount of work done, particularly in the last two years, when we renewed everything from the San Jos√© Convention to the various regional integration efforts."
"What would be the point now in launching new initiatives when the San Jos√© Agreement was renewed in the Council of Minsters in Florence in the second half of last year?"
"What would be the point in new ideas when we are still at the analysis stage, about to embark on the final negotiations with MERCOSUR, Chile, and the new option which has emerged for the Andean Community, and when we are trying to find a negotiating formula for the last remaining agreement, the one with Mexico?"
"I would prefer in the coming 3 or 4 years to consolidate the work already done, which has been very important because, in fact, it is scarcely 2 or 3 years since the European Union started shaping a much more specific strategy for the Latin American continent."
"As Mr Cabez√≥n said, Latin America is not a homogenous concept."
"There are many Latin Americas."
"Consequently it was necessary to work very flexibly so that, while maintaining exclusively the horizontal level - the Rio Group - as a specialised forum for political dialogue, the European Union could offer a suitable cooperation platform to every country, from the North to the South of Latin America, in line with the regional, territorial and political needs as well as the level of economic development of these countries."
"Thus we started to produce a sub-regional integration plan which we have been gradually consolidating, and which we regard as pioneering work."
"There is no antagonism between the position of the United States and that of the European Union regarding, for instance, NAFTA."
"We are not concerned about NAFTA, Mr Bertens."
"NAFTA has not been extended to any other Latin American country in the past three years."
"In these 3 years, however, the European Union has become involved in MERCOSUR, Chile, a new San Jos√© agreement, an agreement with Mexico, and a new agricultural GSP."
"We will have to check our figures, but according to the OECD figures the European Union accounted for up to 61.5 % of development cooperation in the last three years."
"Next comes Japan with 19.5 % and then, in third place, the United States with 14 %."
"It would be very difficult to reproach the European Union for not concerning itself sufficiently with the Latin American continent when, based on the OECD figures for last year, we represent 62 % of cooperation, much less attempt to compare it with the United States which was even surpassed by Japan last year, and which accounts for only 14 %."
"The European Union cannot be reproached for this because the efforts made were very considerable, even outstanding."
"One thing I would admit you are right about, Mr Bertens, is that although we are the main cooperation partner with 62 %, this is not known, or not very well known."
"You are right about this."
"But how can you achieve visibility in today's world?"
"In order to be visible and present in world communications, in addition to determination you need money, money, money."
"It is very difficult for the European Union to ensure the visibility of what it is doing if the communication instruments - which are vital in a media-oriented society like the present - are, quite simply, very fragile."
"On another level, in relation to our external action, you have proposed in your report up to 22 measures concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the political dialogue."
"I pray that this issue is solved by the Treaty of Amsterdam because the common foreign and security policy is not an area in which the European Union's credibility is at its best."
"Second, I cannot accept either the statement that there has been a fall-off in financial and trade relations because, and I would stress this, this is not reflected in the OECD figures."
"At this moment, with regard to Latin America, the European Union is the main trading partner of nine countries, and the second biggest partner of eight countries."
"These nine countries include the most important in economic terms - MERCOSUR, Chile, etc."
"In trade terms, the flows between the two continents increased by 40 % in the last three years, which is spectacular."
"In terms of stock, the increase in direct European investments in manufacturing sectors in recent years has quite simply been extraordinary."
"Several European Union countries have even tripled their direct productive investments. I do not need to quote examples as these appear in the media every day."
"I would like once again to bring up the question of comparison with United States policy."
"Mr Bertens, this year - 1996 - the United States surpassed us in investments, but you know that investments consist of direct productive investments and investment funds."
"The European Union is still Latin America's most important partner, hence the quality of our cooperation due to our direct productive investments, in other words capital which is invested to create wealth, jobs and development."
"Let us turn then to the OECD statistics on financial flows because such flows are not always equivalent to development processes as they may simply consist of fleeting capital which comes and goes depending on interest rates."
"I think that there is no doubt that much remains to be done, but we have nothing to reproach ourselves for, having made a leap which I would describe as nothing less than spectacular in some sectors."
"Things are going well in economic terms, and we must now develop what we started in the last few years."
"There is one fact of which little has been said, but which I consider essential in relation to Latin America."
"There is no doubt that the continent's differential is now positive, and Latin America is no longer the continent of galloping inflation, military dictatorships or trade debts."
"There is political stability, and a lot of progress has been achieved. We have witnessed the peace processes, and the trade debts have been repaid."
"The problem facing Latin America in the coming century - which is very important and which I think we will have to discuss in future - is its social debt."
"Latin America has not paid its social debt."
"There is a lot of poverty and marginalisation."
"The level at which wealth is increasing is spectacular, sometimes an average of 7 % to 8 % for the whole continent. In this respect it is similar to the Asian model."
"But I am very much afraid that this wealth is not distributed properly."
"I really believe that this will be the unfinished business to be dealt with in Latin America in the next century."
"Economic adjustments have been made, financial adjustments have been made, and 'political' adjustments are being made so that we can get along with each other."
"In future we will have to concern ourselves with the internal stability of the continent, which means combating poverty, because otherwise it will be difficult to sustain the economic and political successes achieved in recent years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"San Jos√© dialogue"
"The next item is the report (A4-0418/96) by Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council on the renewal of the San Jos√© dialogue between the European Union and Central America (COM(95)0600 - C40102/96)."
"President, a quick glance is sufficient to see that there is big difference between the Central America of the beginning of the eighties and the Central America of the midnineties."
"In fact, from an isthmus plagued by military regimes, open armed conflict and continuous violations of human rights, it has become a region taking its first steps towards pluralist political systems based on universal suffrage, where human rights are increasingly being respected and agreements have been reached which have silenced the weapons and enshrined national reconciliation as a principle and an objective."
"The end of the Cold War and, of course, the strength of the Central Americans themselves, are at the root of this change for the better, from darkness to hope."
"The action of the European Union has also contributed to this, marked for over a decade by the San Jos√© process."
"This process is one of the Union's most creditable external policy actions."
"Above all when it is considered that the process was launched, got off the ground and was maintained under the adverse conditions of the aggressive United States policy which characterised the Reagan era."
"Despite the success of this we cannot ignore the fact that much remains to be done in Central America, as regards both political and socio-economic aspects, in order to achieve an acceptable situation."
"Democracy must be consolidated by reinforcing the rule of law and obtaining full respect for individual and collective human rights, which requires, among other things, the creation of an independent judiciary with which to combat effectively the abominable phenomenon of impunity."
"The European Union will also have to help ensure compliance with and the implementation of the peace agreements which have been concluded, the last one of which was signed on 29 December between the Guatemalan Government and the URNG commanders - obviously excellent news."
"Above all, it will be essential to combat the enormous economic and social shortcomings which are a result of persisting under-development, and which lead to increased inequalities, poverty, marginalisation and exclusion."
"Not only must we renew the San Jos√© dialogue, but we must also strengthen and extend it as much as possible, underlining its basic objectives and making available the instruments necessary to achieve these."
"In addition to the objectives referred to above in the political and social fields, there are two others which in fact cover these areas: the proper and acceptable integration of Central America into the international economy, not by means of adjustment and regulatory policies, but based on strategies which promote models of development sustainable in human and ecological terms, and the boosting of regional integration itself."
"The various proposals contained in the report I am presenting on behalf of the Committee on External Affairs are a step in this direction, but there is one more point I would like to emphasise."
"The formulation of a comprehensive Common Foreign and Security Policy action programme for Central America, adequately funded, like the relevant cooperation framework agreement, should be accompanied by a financial protocol which would involve a substantial increase in the resources assigned to cooperation with Central America."
"Such a programme should include measures to modernise and consolidate the rule of law which would be aimed, for instance, at combatting impunity, promoting human rights, supporting refugees and the return of displaced persons, ensuring democratic control over the armed forces and cut-backs in military expenditure, as well as providing protection for indigenous groups and sections of the population such as women; extending to the Central American industrial sector the new Generalized System of Preferences of which the Andean countries are beneficiaries; cancelling, at least partly, the external debts of the countries in the region; providing impetus in the fight against the drugs trade and, lastly, any measures that would enhance the quality of life and also achieve more equality, combatting, as I have already said, poverty, exclusion and marginalisation."
"Similarly, in adopting a stance in favour of intensifying the political dialogue between the European Union and Central America, we must suggest that both the European Parliament and PARLACEN should play an increased role in this, these being the only parliaments in the world directly elected on a transnational basis, and that a Civil Society Consultative Forum be set up, in which initiatives such as the ICIC and bodies such as the CIFCA can be included and take part."
"We must not forget either our wish to see the European Commission being given the human and material resources to accomplish its work in this area in the best possible way."
"Mr President, I think that we need to continue the positive work achieved so far, and that it is now necessary to stimulate, continue and complete this work which should not be halted because Central America and Europe still have a lot to achieve."
"Mr President, the contribution made by the European Union through the San Jos√© dialogue to ending the horrific civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and, more recently, Guatemala is very considerable and demonstrates quite clearly the positive role that the European Union can play on the world scene."
"Ironically enough, however, the advent of peace means that the attention given to the area is likely to decline quite steeply, despite the fact that many of the underlying problems have by no means been resolved."
"This report is important because it identifies the basic needs in the region and specifies in clear terms the policies which the European Union should now pursue."
"The San Jos√© process should continue providing an opportunity for an exchange of views and discussion not only through the conferences - at two of which I have had the opportunity to speak on behalf of Parliament - but also through greater involvement of civil society in the region."
"It is vital that every possible step should be taken to devote attention to the prevention of new human rights abuses and to resist the covering-up of those which occurred in the past by means of general amnesties and the like."
"Efforts must also be concentrated on social issues."
"Huge numbers of people - particularly the indigenous populations - are grossly afflicted by poverty."
"Poverty alleviation, health-care and educational reform are vital and cannot be achieved by neo-liberal solutions imposed from outside."
"It is clear that regional integration is in the overall interests of the population but not unless special measures are taken to defend the interests of all who are vulnerable."
"The debt problem and the need to safeguard the environment are other issues which must not be overlooked or forgotten."
"This report points the way in which policies should be developed."
"The European Union can, and should, play its full part within this region."
"Mr President, much of what has been said about Mr Bertens' report also applies, of course, to Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez' very good report."
"So I will confine myself to a few comments on the problem specific to this region."
"Even more than South America, Central America has for years been the subject of fierce debate in this Parliament between the European parties and their Central American partners on the right road to follow."
"Today democracy and peace prevail in most of the countries."
"A democratically elected president has just been freely elected in Nicaragua for the second time and the EU has signed an agreement with Nicaragua aimed at supporting the education system and improving the judicial system."
"The San Jos√© dialogue that has begun between Latin America and the EU and its results since 1984 may well be regarded as one of the few truly successful examples of a common foreign policy."
"The framework agreement between the partner countries of the 1993 general agreement on Central American integration forms an important cornerstone of this cooperation."
"It must be extended and updated."
"What we do not have, however, is an institutionalized parliamentary dialogue, and that is what the EP would like to see."
"But where there is light, or at least a little more light, there are also shadows: the high indebtedness, poor economic conditions, social conflicts, the integration of returning refugees, unemployment, an integration policy that does not always work and the retraining both of former soldiers and also of resistance fighters are a threat to democracies that are not yet stable."
"There are still human rights infringements."
"The European Parliament has discussed these questions on numerous occasions, e.g., in relation to the street children of Guatemala."
"But it is Guatemala that has just introduced a peace process on which we again want to congratulate the negotiating partners."
"We welcome and support that process."
"But the most difficult task is to carry it through."
"After years of military action, terrorism, countless deaths and distrust, a common policy needs to be formulated, which will not be easy."
"Here it is up to the European Union and its joint committee to act as a suitable instrument of conciliation."
"We must persevere in our cooperation with the government and the parties, unions and social organizations."
"We must propose measures to promote the rule of law and an independent judiciary, human rights and their enforcement by the police and the military."
"It is essential for a civil society to develop that really is prepared to assume political tasks and responsibilities and to resolve economic and social problems on its own."
"We must do our share with programmes for local development, decentralization, land reform and the equality of women, and they must not just be programmes for times of crisis."
"They must be real programmes, for unless we can persuade this civil society to take on responsibility for itself, if we, the EU do not help, then all the splendid words spoken in this Parliament are useless. that is why we ask the Commission to give real support in this area."
"Mr President, sometimes it is gratifying to see that things are going well in the world and that is the case in Central America."
"Ten years ago I was in Nicaragua and El Salvador as rapporteur on the conflict there and now peace has actually broken out in Guatemala."
"Now that peace has come it is important that constitutional rule and democracy should be consolidated."
"The dialogue between the EU and Central America has already borne fruit."
"Still more can be achieved if the Commission is prepared to go along with the suggestion for a detailed multiannual programme for Central America which Mr Carnero makes in his excellent report."
"Then, I think, we must above all be careful to ensure that as many social groups as possible are able to take part, the trade unions, for example."
"Because most of the governments in this region do not see the importance of this at all."
"In Guatemala, for example, a trade union organization was banned outright by the authorities only last year."
"It would be particularly unfortunate, and here I agree with what the Commissioner said in his earlier comments on Mr Bertens' report, if the same thing were to happen in Central America as happened in Latin America, namely growth but without fair distribution."
"If that happens people will continue to suffer."
"Commissioner Mar√≠n hit the nail on the head: this is not the way to do things."
"So I hope the Commission will be vigilant to ensure that this social dialogue gets going, with the trade unions, but the employers too, taking part."
"You may find this strange, but there is no degree of organization among the employers in Latin America either."
"The best thing would thus be a social dialogue of the kind we have in Europe between employers and workers."
"I am delighted to see that not only the Commissioner, the Latin America expert, is here but also the new vicepresident of Parliament who is a member of my Group."
"I hope this report of Mr Carnero's will be favourably received by the Commission."
"Mr President, the San Jos√© dialogue process was a model of integrated policy for the European Union: to undervalue it therefore and reduce it the level of a mere experiment in development cooperation would be a mistake on our part and a mistake for the countries of the Central American isthmus."
"If we consider that Latin America currently holds a central position in the mainstream of world development, those countries lie at its very heart: they represent the most sensitive and the most fragile link but one that is crucial to our policy and needs therefore to be viewed with all its implications - in terms of the CFSP then, in our jargon, and not just cooperation."
"If we move in that direction, Commissioner, Parliament will give its wholehearted support."
"That means that as far as Central America is concerned, we need concepts and a programme whose economic and institutional objectives are consistent and in step with one another."
"That programme must be based on three principles: first of all, encouragement for regionalization as the only institutional model able to turn to good use the positive effects of globalization and attenuate its negative effects; secondly, encouragement for regionally-based parliaments which offer the most modern system of applying a policy of safeguarding human and political rights in those countries and providing a framework for social dialogue - in that connection it is frankly deplorable that the Florence document made no mentioned of PARLACEN; and, finally, aid targeted primarily at municipalities and local communities and subject to sensible and detailed monitoring by the Commission and this House, as appropriate, to prevent the diversion of aid triggering fresh tensions in countries, such as Guatemala, that have just emerged from civil war."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Carnero Gonzalez, on his report."
"The Commission agrees not only with its general terms but also with its specific aspects because, finally, what Mr Carnero's report makes clear is, first of all - I am referring to what I said earlier in my comments on Latin America - the need to renew and upgrade the San Jos√© dialogue which, in the words of one of the Members, is perhaps, in all modesty, one of the most solid and convincing actions which the European Union has conducted under foreign policy."
"If we compare the state of the San Jos√© dialogue when the Esquipulas Group was set up, remembering what happened in Central America, with the contemporary political situation, it can in fact be considered that an enormous leap has been made as regards the political stabilisation of the Central American isthmus."
"It is true that the end of the Cold War was a help and it is also true that with peace in Guatemala, the last civil conflict which existed in Central American countries has now been settled."
"How was this achieved?"
"The San Jos√© dialogue was started ten years ago and maintained during the Cold War on certain bases, the main aims of which were to end the civil wars, establish democratic systems and produce a plan for economic development."
"Central America has changed a lot in the last five years."
"Very difficult and complicated political situations had emerged which have been solved democratically, and civil wars have been ended."
"And now we have the phenomenon of Guatemala: next week, on 20 and 21, the donors' advisory committee is to meet in Brussels, under the aegis of the European Commission, which demonstrates, if not the leadership, then at least the increasingly important role of the European Union in delicate processes such as this peace process."
"A whole new dimension is needed."
"Hence the Florence agreement for a new vision of our relations with Central America."
"Mr Carnero, what Central America actually needs is the concept of state."
"Consequently, our fundamental objective, very briefly, is to foster decentralised cooperation with civil society."
"My idea is to gradually involve NGOs, preferably local ones."
"The micro-projects (we are now conducting almost 400 of these) cost a lot in terms of money and work, and are, of course, difficult to control from Brussels."
"We have ideas and we have enough money, but we need more officials."
"Therefore I want to transfer a lot of the small projects to local NGOs, concentrate on the rule of law, essentially in relation to parliaments - we intend to cooperate on the reform of various parliaments following the example of Paraguay - on the reform of government administration, justice, tax administration and financial administration."
"This will essentially be the central element of cooperation in the next five years, the aim being to have one idea accepted: that a democratic State needs more than anything else a State which is starting to demonstrate the credibility of all the peace and political processes in the region."
"The response we have had from the other side of the Atlantic has been truly extraordinary, the proof of this being that it was not necessary to insist in order to get the Guatemalan authorities to propose to us, on the very day they signed the peace accord, to organise the donors' advisory committee in Brussels under the new parameters of the San Jos√© Process, which means that once again, the European Union will be at the helm in this exercise - and we can do this because the financing involved is relatively modest, and we have the people to do it."
"Central America's problem is once again poverty and marginalisation, but this is much more acute than in other Latin American countries."
"I am convinced that the Latin American continent will produce strong, democratic and efficient States, otherwise development aid will not work very well."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Protection of privacy in telecommunications"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0415/96) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, in particular in the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and in the public digital mobile networks (C4-0470/96-00/0288(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr Medina Ortega)."
"Mr President, I would like to say that if we had wanted to find a name that was not clear, that was against transparency, it would be impossible to find a more entertaining one than the one on this directive or proposal for a directive, which is called (at least in Spanish - I do not know how it sounds to the Commissioner in his native tongue) directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, in particular in the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and in the public digital mobile networks."
"This is something very mysterious and very specialised."
"In reality, what we have here is a directive to guarantee the protection of individuals in the telecommunications sector."
"I would like to take advantage of the fact that the Commissioner is present to say that in the interests of fulfilling the principle of transparency and familiarity with Community law, the best thing would be for him to accept the amendment of the title, as proposed in Amendment No 2 of our text, which speaks of the directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector."
"I think that Amendment No 2 will help Community citizens to understand what we are talking about."
"This directive complements another one which we approved not long ago, the directive on the protection of personal data and privacy in general. It is being applied to the telecommunications sector here."
"Another amendment to achieve simplification, which I do not think the Commissioner has before him because only the Spanish version is concerned, is Amendment No 1, which replaces the expression 'public telecommunication services' by 'accessible telecommunication services' ."
"In any case, I would say that good work has been done in relation to this directive. We have taken our time, and I think that it was a good idea to take our time because the mist has gradually dispersed."
"The first draft Commission communication dates from 1990; it accompanied the general directive on data protection."
"The Parliament took its time and completed its first report in 1992."
"The directive on data protection subsequently followed its own course of development and was kept separate from the directive on data protection in the telecommunications sector."
"In fact the amended Commission proposal to Parliament and Council dates from 1994, thus there are four years between the initial proposal and the amended proposal."
"Finally, the Council's common position was adopted in 1996 and has arrived at Parliament at a time when everything is perfectly clear to us."
"We in the Committee on Legal Affairs discussed this in an atmosphere characteristic of our committee, which is one of considerable consensus extending across the political spectrum, the concern being to guarantee the privacy of individuals."
"The most important innovation of this directive is probably the fact that it applies not only to natural persons but also to corporate persons."
"One thing that does not make sense, and I think that the Commissioner would agree with me on this, is to speak of subsidiarity in this area."
"It is absurd that, in the case of a telephone call from Paris to London, one country applies one law and another one applies a different law, because if we are trying to protect the privacy of people, it is only normal to apply the same law."
"It is pointless to speak of subsidiarity in this connection."
"In my view, the reason why some British politicians like this word so much is because it is very difficult to pronounce in English and nobody knows what 'subsidiarity' means."
"If a phone call is made from Paris to London, there is no reason why one law should be applied in Paris and another in London."
"This is not the place for subsidiarity, therefore, and this is the purpose of our Amendment No 7."
"There is no reason for subsidiarity."
"This directive is different from the other one in that it applies not only to natural persons but also to the protection of corporate persons, and the Committee on Legal Affairs did not disapprove of extending the protection in this way."
"But what does not make sense is that in some countries corporate persons can be protected and in others they cannot, because this brings us back to the same problem."
"In other words, if a multinational company calls London from Paris, the message can be protected in Paris but perhaps not in London."
"This is absurd, and therefore several of the amendments are aimed at preventing it."
"Although as the rapporteur I must recommend all the amendments, I can tell you now that a political group, in fact the one to which I belong, is going to try and remove all national legislative options which enable a distinction to be made between national powers."
"I think that not much remains to be done. We are proposing several amendments to simplify the rule and make it a little more rational: there is no room for subsidiarity or for different national laws."
"Mr President, already today, the information society is characterized by telecommunications and data transfers, which between them provide almost unlimited possibilities of communication."
"These possibilities are as hard to predict as they are numerous, and that is why it is important for the individual to be protected against abuse, and for us to ensure that democratic controls can be applied."
"With the achievements of progress in the field of telecommunications, it has become possible to obtain and distribute personal information on such things as people's interest in certain web sites, their sexuality, and so on. For the Internet too, rules need to be drawn up on protection of privacy, but this should not be done in such a way that some people are indirectly denied access to information, because this automatically leads to anyone interested being able to obtain information affecting privacy."
"However, that should not prevent us from applying sensible democratic controls to what is supplied on the Internet, controls which must provide safeguards against the unlawful supplying of information."
"Today, it is possible to find anything on the Internet, from bomb-making recipes and methods of torture to threats against employees and child pornography - anything at all which can be distributed - because no address is given for the provider."
"If we wish to stamp out child pornography, for example, it needs to be specified that when material is supplied on the Internet, an address is always given, a personal code or something of the kind, so that it is the supplier who is responsible."
"The principle of freedom with responsibility must also be applied on the Internet."
"Mr President, as mentioned by the rapporteur, who has carried out commendable work on this report and on the common position we are concerned with today, doubtless the result of a laborious consensus, it is not just the title but the entire text which is confusing and ambiguous, and it is difficult to recognise it as the initial proposal on which this House gave its opinion after the first reading."
"Having said that, it is necessary to stress that this directive deals with a complex and delicate situation requiring an urgent solution."
"It forms part of a legal space which is completely asymmetric, in which national regulations differ radically, because telecommunications are being projected onto a veritable technological and economic battlefield."
"And to this scenario must be added the ups and downs suffered by this directive."
"The general directive on the protection of personal data came into force between the first and second readings, which makes this directive a sectoral directive, geared more to the management of these data in the specific field of communications than to actual protection, in relation to which constant reference is made - it could not be otherwise - to the general directive."
"Moreover, unlike the initial proposal, this directive - as pointed out by the rapporteur - includes corporate persons and is also extended to cover certain services which were not covered by the first version, for instance videos on demand and a few other services of this kind."
"Against this background, the European People's Party will tomorrow vote for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs, with the purely technical Amendment No 12 which was submitted by the Group to the House."
"Some are intended to improve the text, in other words improve legal security, and in this connection I would point to the amendment to the title: if the content has changed, it is only right that the title should reflect this change."
"Others, as mentioned by the rapporteur, refer to the proper use of the concept of subsidiarity."
"Lastly, the remaining ones serve to protect the legitimate interests of consumers and user companies."
"The European People's Party will also vote for the removal of the third paragraph of Article 12, and the corresponding one in recital 20, since we do not think it right to have a distinction here between the way in which the legitimate interests of natural and corporate persons are treated and protected."
"Finally, Mr President and Commissioner, we will vote in favour of Amendment No 11, submitted by the Liberal Group, which we consider necessary, not only in strict application of the provisions of the single market, which are not really in keeping with the two possibilities in the current text, but also because we think that it provides a fairer compromise between the legitimate interests of companies and the legitimate interests of personal data protection for natural persons and users."
"Mr President, as has been stated already, there are exciting changes taking place within the telecommunications industry."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that, sometimes I have the feeling that we are approaching the future backwards; we are so out of step in our attitudes."
"We have created the term 'public service' ."
"We want everyone to have access at reasonable, that is to say, low cost."
"But there are no 'free lunches' ."
"We must remember what has happened in Eastern Europe, where it was thought that there were 'free lunches' ."
"Future generations will have to pay the price for such abuse there."
"The Directive under debate here today, to some extent addresses this problem, but it is only partially covered, in Article 8 for example."
"The description to be found here and in many other Directives covering the Telecommunications market does not in any way correspond to the situation which exists in those Member States which have come furthest along the path of liberalisation of the telecommunication market, Scandinavian countries for example."
"As there are very different circumstances in each country it is absolutely essential that the principle of subsidiarity is applied."
"We can even give examples of the fact that we have come a long way in Scandinavia and that free competition has given opportunities for an improved service and for the promotion of regional equality: the cost of national and international calls has been reduced considerably and there have been very significant developments going on."
"I would like to point out that last year, 600 000 mobile telephones were sold in Finland, which has a population of 5 million people; the Finnish Members of the European Parliament are obviously not the only ones with this type of equipment."
"What can we learn from this?"
"That, for this sector, where technical progress is moving forwards we find ourselves out of step which will lead to misuse of our resources and which will alter Europe's competitiveness."
"I hope, therefore, that we will bear this in mind during this discussion."
"Mr President, the Telecommunications industry is growing and it is now vital to ensure that the personal details held in digital telecommunications networks are protected against improper use."
"It is also vital that people, if they so wish, can gain access to the information held in the various telecommunications registers."
"I think that the principle to use for this is one of openness, in other words, everything which appears in the telephone directory such as telephone numbers and addresses should be publicly available unless decided otherwise."
"Anything which is not considered to be in the public domain may still be given out with care and the principle of personal protection must not replace the principle of openness and the right of each and everyone to gain access to information."
"This is clearly regulated in the Swedish principle of openness and the Data Protection Act has worked well."
"As I see it, the rules of harmonisation should go no further than maintaining the principle of openness."
"Obviously there should be restrictions on phone tapping and subscribers should have the right to an ex-directory number."
"In my opinion, the formulation of detailed regulations should, as far as possible, take place at national level."
"Mr President, as the House will know, the original proposal for this directive, as Mr Medina Ortega said, dates back to 1990 and the revised proposal was submitted in 1994."
"The arrival at a common position has - to say the least - taken rather longer than usual and, understandably, that has caused some inconvenience for this Parliament."
"In view of that fact the Commission is all the more grateful to this House for the constructive attitude that has been shown both in the first and second readings and we are particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, who was also the rapporteur for the general directive on data protection, for his particular patience and for the perceptive and productive way in which he has dealt with the proposed directive on second reading."
"We will be rendering a service to both economic operators and to consumers by adopting this directive."
"It is obviously essential that the rapidly expanding telecommunications sector keeps the confidence of users and it is equally clear that those users must be certain that the increasing amount of information they are confiding to networks is handled with complete integrity and will not be used for any purposes which they do not intend or do not desire."
"In addition, public awareness about privacy and data protection is increasing and Member States have to respond effectively to legitimate concerns."
"To avoid great divergences in national provisions which could hinder the free provision of services in the internal market, it is essential for us to ensure that there is agreement on a basic set of principles that can be respected in practical terms throughout the Community."
"In short, we need to ensure that the information society offers equal opportunities and mutual benefits to all."
"In that process, the basic rights of users need to be adequately defined and equitable competitive conditions for all operators have to be guaranteed."
"Those are the main purposes of this directive and against that background I now offer the Commission's responses to the amendments."
"Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 12 are viewed by the Commission as useful clarification and improvements to the text and therefore they are readily accepted by the Commission."
"Amendment No 9 removes the ability of operators to charge subscribers for not having their particulars entered in the public directory."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament than an individual subscriber should not have to pay for the right to privacy and we can therefore support that amendment."
"I have to tell the House, however, that the remaining proposed amendments are not acceptable on grounds that I hope the House will recognize to be rational and will come to agree with."
"Firstly, on Amendment No 5, I have to remind the House that the draft directive allows Member States to limit the application of Article 11 on directories to natural persons, i.e. to private citizens."
"The reason for this clearly is that the facility for legal persons, commercial companies and so on, to determine whether they are included or not in the public directory is not a fundamental human right but rather a legitimate interest."
"As a result, it was felt that the arrangements for accommodating the legitimate interest of legal persons would not need to be as prescriptive as those for guaranteeing the right to privacy."
"Moreover, the argument for offering extended public directory options free-of-charge would be less compelling in the case of legal persons than it is, obviously, in the case of private citizens."
"The amendment before us introduces a new element, namely a right of information of the user which is not covered in any way by the substance of the directive and which would seem to suggest if interpreted a contrario , that Member States may actually be allowed to oblige legal persons to appear in the public directory."
"That is not the intention and it certainly confuses the issue."
"On those grounds therefore the Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendment No 8 - simply because it contains a drafting error."
"However, the amendment is replaced by Amendment No 12 which the Commission can support."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11."
"The amendment would delete the possibility for Member States to offer a higher level of protection to individual subscribers against unsolicited calls."
"The common position allows Member States to choose an opt-in or an opt-out system for unsolicited calls made for direct marketing purposes."
"That means that governments can either prohibit such calls in general unless subscribers have indicated that they do not mind receiving those calls or allow those calls in general while providing the opportunity for subscribers to indicate in a public list that they do not want to receive unsolicited calls for direct marketing."
"The House may recall that this approach has also been chosen on the same issue in the Distance Selling Directive which was discussed here earlier today."
"The Commission cannot support this amendment because it would delete the option with the higher level of protection and would do so without any imperative reason that relates to the operation of the internal market."
"As to the proposal to delete paragraph 3 of Article 11, the Commission cannot support this because there are valid reasons not to apply the detailed provisions regarding the privacy option for natural persons in exactly the same way as they would be applied to legal persons, as I indicated in response to another amendment."
"For legal persons it is not the right to privacy which is at stake but a legitimate interest to determine how they should appear in public directories."
"They will not necessarily need the same options as private citizens and the offer of all options free of charge may not always be warranted."
"Therefore, a differentiation is made in Article 11 of the proposed Directive."
"The Commission would be able to support a clarification of Article 11(3) to explain that the legitimate interests of legal persons should be taken care of in all cases but not necessarily in the same way as the right to privacy of natural persons."
"Such an addition to Article 11(3) could read: In this case Member States must ensure that sufficient options are available which take account of the legitimate interests of subscribers other than natural persons with regard to their entry in public directories' ."
"On a final point relating to the amendments, the Commission cannot support the deletion of paragraph 3 of Article 12, again because there are valid reasons not to apply exactly the same provisions to legal persons as to natural persons."
"In order briefly to clarify the points at issue, it would be acceptable, in the Commission's view, to add a sentence to the third paragraph of Article 12 so that it would read as follows: ' Member States may limit the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 to subscribers who are natural persons to the extent that the legitimate interests of subscribers other than natural persons and, in particular, those of small and medium-sized enterprises remain sufficiently protected' ."
"I hope that on reflection Members of the House will accept the reasoning of the Commission on the minority of amendments which are not acceptable."
"I further hope that it will be possible to take advantage of the basic convergence of the views of the Commission and of this House, and to secure adoption of the Directive very early this year."
"I thank the rapporteur and his colleagues for the work that they have done in improving this proposed Directive."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has just proposed an oral amendment to one of the amendments."
"I hope that he will put it in writing for me so that we can formulate our opinion on it before the vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Air traffic management"
"The next item is the report (A4-0381/96) by Mr Cornelissen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Commission's White Paper on Air Traffic Management - Freeing Europe's airspace."
"Last week, Mr President, I received the latest figures on delays in air transport."
"Last November more than 20 % of European scheduled services were delayed by a quarter of an hour or more."
"I fear that following the improvements made in 1993 and 1994 the delays are getting a lot worse."
"That means great inconvenience to travellers and it costs a packet."
"Experts predict that savings of 2.5 billion ECU a year could be made here."
"In other words, 50 million ECU a week are being wasted."
"Of course delays are not good for safety either, the number one priority for all of us."
"According to some estimates there are usually 60 to 70 extra planes in the air as a result of the congestion."
"Congestion also means more air pollution and excessive noise."
"The reason for this congestion is not insufficient airspace but the unbelievably inefficient way in which European airspace is managed."
"Air traffic control in Europe is still organized nationally."
"We have come an awfully long way towards abolishing borders on the ground, but in the air nationalism is still flying high."
"Thus Europe still has 49 ATC centres, 31 national systems, 18 hardware suppliers, 22 control systems and 30 programming languages."
"I will not deny that considerable results have been achieved since the ECAC ministers took the decision to work together more closely in 1988."
"We certainly need to continue with that, but it is not enough."
"All the indications are that air travel will expand enormously, and experts predict that it will double over the next ten years."
"If policy remains unchanged, with increased fragmentation of Europe's airspace, the consequences will be disastrous."
"The Commission's White Paper makes that abundantly clear."
"A genuinely European approach is desperately needed."
"Only an integrated ATM system can provide a lasting solution."
"European airspace must be operated as a collective entity without national borders and differences between civilian and military airspace must be eliminated."
"As I understand it the ECAC ministers propose to take a decision on 14 February on the future institutional structure of European ATM."
"Given the European Union's responsibilities in this area I should like to ask the Commissioner a few questions: how does he propose to safeguard the Community's interests here?"
"Take the necessary separation of regulation and management."
"How are we to ensure that the responsibility for planning and the division of airspace rests with the authority?"
"How are we to prevent a veto by one Member State from obstructing implementation by another Member State?"
"How is democratic scrutiny at Community level to be ensured?"
"And should we not go for a Eurocontrol convention which can be modified faster to take account of technological, political or economic changes?"
"Is the Commissioner prepared to keep Parliament informed of developments and to debate the question of accession with us again once we know what the new convention looks like?"
"The Benelux countries and Germany recently devised an integrated concept for ATC centres which provides for free route airspace above 30 000 feet."
"Is the Commission prepared to encourage regional developments of this kind which will increase capacity in the short term?"
"They are desperately necessary, not least in the interests of safety."
"1996 was the worst year in aviation history as regards safety."
"57 accidents with more than 1800 people killed, and that is not counting accidents involving sabotage."
"For the sake of safety too, a system of European air traffic management with a clearer distribution of responsibilities is an absolute must."
"After so many years of talking I hope the Member State governments will at last find the courage to put the interest of their citizens first."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately the limitless skies referred to at times by Pam Cornelissen all too often turn into a real hell."
"Last year a colleague from my group, Brian Simpson, and I tabled a motion for a resolution following the crash in the Caribbean in which all 189 passengers of a Birgenair aircraft lost their lives."
"We did so in order to make it clear that air safety is not the responsibility of air traffic control alone but that other basic aspects must also be taken into account, such as technical safety standards, together with high-level training of pilots and all the ancillary workers in the aircraft industry."
"Some of the demands we made were satisfied."
"Some Member States have taken steps to draw up a black list."
"Let me also give due recognition to what the German transport minister, Mr Wissmann, has done, in forbidding the take-off or landing of aircraft that revealed certain weaknesses following more stringent checks."
"But all these are only first steps."
"I would ask the Commission to take action and in particular to draft a directive that would persuade the giant companies to indicate in their brochures the air carrier which will be used."
"This is done in some Member States."
"In our motion for a resolution we call for this practice to be extended throughout the territory of the European Union."
"We need a uniform air traffic monitoring system on everything that can happen these areas, a kind of air traffic management system."
"For years Parliament has been calling for greater efficiency, compatibility and higher productivity."
"I think we owe that to the consumers, but also to the airline companies which, of course, also have an obligation to fulfil."
"We know that the European airlines are facing very strong competition and the cost burden referred to by Mr von Cornelissen does indeed speak for itself."
"The first step must be to improve coordination in order to avoid further mistakes."
"But I think that it must be established very soon that the Commission bears the central responsibility, and that like the mandate it was given for negotiations with third countries, the Commission must also be given a mandate to consider these aspects."
"I believe we do need a common airspace with the Central and Eastern European countries and with the Mediterranean area as a whole."
"We should also ensure that the technical equipment is properly compatible."
"At the same time I hope that European technology can be used here."
"Why, given our efficiency in this technology, do we have to buy in from 'outside' ?"
"I do not think that is necessary."
"As an everyday example: my son is a commercial airline pilot."
"He keeps telling about the thoughtlessness of some air traffic controllers, saying that when planes fly over certain countries, especially Italy and France, the controllers give instructions in their mother-tongue."
"If only as a matter of terminology, the air traffic control language used should be English."
"All this must included in the list of measures that can be introduced."
"I have little sympathy for the casual acceptance of this kind of risk."
"I see it as irresponsible."
"Our aim is standardization within a European, possibly even a Community European civil aviation authority."
"That is our common aim."
"Until then we will have to take a few interim steps in that direction, but I think we agree on the ultimate aim."
"My dear Mr Cornelissen, thank you very much for all the work you have put into this report."
"I would like to take this opportunity to give very warm thanks for your two and a half years of hard work as chairman of the committee."
"Our friend Mr Cornelissen has retired from this office."
"I thank him warmly for his much-appreciated work."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cornelissen, for his report on such a complex and difficult subject as the White Paper on air traffic management."
"It must be admitted that the Commission's analysis in the White Paper is comprehensive and extraordinarily rigorous."
"I have no option, however, but to agree with the rapporteur's view that the solutions proposed in the White Paper do not match the brilliance of the Commission's analysis."
"It is not possible to propose, as a solution to this problem, that the European Union should simply join Eurocontrol."
"Everyone knows - and this was made perfectly clear at the hearing we held in the Committee on Transport and Tourism - that Eurocontrol was unable to fulfil its commitments to guarantee a harmonised air traffic control system in Europe because many of the Member States withdrew the supranational powers they had granted to the organisation in the past."
"Mr President, I have always said that this is a serious and urgent problem."
"Serious because it affects the operating costs of our undertakings, which are paying a very high price for the lack of a harmonised air traffic control system in Europe, and urgent because each time there is a disruption, not only does this involve losses for our undertakings, but also incalculable inconvenience for our citizens."
"I believe, Mr President, that this issue should be taken very, very seriously indeed."
"Until powers are clearly delineated and institutional, political, administrative, scientific and technical solutions are arrived at, we can do nothing."
"I have always said, Commissioner, that these powers lie with the European Union and that it must assume them with determination, that Eurocontrol has the means but not the power, and that the European Conference of Transport Ministers has neither the means nor the power, but has a lot of ideas."
"Commissioner, I invite you to put forward proposals in a determined bid to preserve Community powers and find solutions to a problem that affects the costs borne by our undertakings and the patience of our citizens."
"Mr President, I too must start by complimenting Mr Cornelissen and thanking him for the two and a half years of hard work he has put in as chairman of our committee."
"This report is an example of that hard work, though the subject of better air traffic management is one which Mr Cornelissen addressed years ago in the Dutch parliament too and has continued to address with great industry."
"Regrettably we have to say that not a lot has come of it and that Eurocontrol, a body of which we originally had high hopes, has in effect never really got off the ground, in this case almost literally, one might say."
"A propos of this I have a further question for both rapporteur and Commissioner regarding the Dutch presidency's programme which has been outlined to us here this afternoon."
"This says that one of the Council presidency's objectives is that the European Union should become a member of Eurocontrol as soon as possible. But paragraph 17 of the rapporteur's report actually says something rather different."
"He too says that we should accede as soon as possible, but he then says in his report that we should add something else or construct a new organization within the EU."
"I should like to have this clarified, because ultimately it is absolutely essential to passenger safety that we should have a better regulated system and less protectionism."
"Mr President, I will be short and to the point."
"The fragmented nature of our airspace management at present is a major problem."
"It pushes up the cost of air traffic control and leads to expensive delays."
"But to be fair, problems at airports and the huge expansion of air travel also play a part here."
"Nevertheless there is no doubt that we need a more efficient system of management."
"We think that the Commission's proposal to separate the regulatory and operational activities of air traffic management will be helpful here."
"I also think it is wise on the Commission's part to place just the regulatory activities on a supranational footing."
"Parliament's efforts to get the practicalities of air traffic managed by a single European body may well be the most economic solution, but the national authorities want to retain responsibility for managing their airspace."
"So this proposal certainly means progress."
"But the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to be involved as well."
"Lastly, Mr President, if air traffic is indeed expected to double by the year 2010, by then it will be too late to start talking about what that means for infrastructure planning and damage to the environment."
"Mr President, this report is actually a compromise on the part of the committee, as there are always a good many votes."
"I am not satisfied with the Commission's three options for solutions."
"However, I do believe that the Commission's one proposal can be taken as a starting-point."
"The report is a very wide-ranging one in both technical and political terms, and is extremely comprehensive."
"Nevertheless, we are all agreed that there is a challenge facing us here: there are indeed problems."
"There are three points I wish to raise."
"The first is that the main thing is for a political decision to be taken on whether we should continue in this direction."
"We cannot discuss technology: we should urge the Council to take a political decision."
"There may be differences in technology, or reluctance, but nonetheless we should move forward."
"Parliament should be encouraging and supporting the Commission here, and we must do more work on this. My second point is that the EU is not enough."
"In this respect, I do not agree with the rapporteur."
"We should not have a democratic body which focuses only on the 15 Member States."
"We are talking about the whole continent of Europe here."
"Because after all, when I am at 30 000 feet and approaching the Polish border, the safety problem is just the same."
"So we cannot just concentrate on the Community."
"The third point concerns the airlines, which in the sacred name of competition are actually making the situation worse."
"They have too little equipment and too few staff, but operations are being stepped up and at the same time they cannot keep to their slots."
"When we talk about traffic jams in the air, Mr Cornelissen, these are often things that are caused by traffic not being able to leave the airport because of inadequate equipment."
"People try to make savings here and there, and then they cannot keep to their slots."
"Those airlines which have enough equipment and staff are able to get airborne on time."
"We need to have consistency from check-in through to check-out."
"It cannot be right that we send people to the moon and to the Mir space station, when we cannot ensure their safety in our own heavily congested airspace."
"I wish the Commissioner good luck in his attempts to press the Council to find a sensible solution."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cornelissen as rapporteur."
"I hope that this will not be the last report that he is going to do for the committee."
"I also welcome the Commissioner here this evening and thank the Commission for their proposals."
"However, there should be more common ground between the Commission and the European Parliament in our proposals."
"Mr L√ºttge has concentrated on a single language."
"I would like to add to that the fact that there should be much greater compatibility between the computers and the various systems used by the national air traffic controllers."
"I accept ECAC's proposal that there should be a common performance model with different systems."
"I hope that the Commissioner is not perhaps wilfully misunderstanding - not that I for a moment suggest that he might - what we in the European Parliament are proposing: that is, not a monolithic structure but simply a single system, but with multiple suppliers."
"There should be more in Europe of what we see in the United States: a single air transport management system, leaving each Member State to organize and run its own services, but having guidelines and budgets set jointly."
"The bottom line, however, for all of us who travel - not least the business community and leisure and tourism travellers - is that the investment required by the Member States is urgent."
"The increase in air transport and in those using our system, which is already overloaded, cannot wait for these budgets to be fixed."
"I commend the proposals in Mr Cornelissen's report to the House and hope that it will get full support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, anyone who has to fly two or three times a week as we MEPs do, is highly aware of the issues of European air traffic management and air safety."
"Delays are an everyday occurrence."
"They affect every fifth flight in Europe."
"Delays, longer flight routes resulting in extra congestion, and the increasing number of accidents and incidents are a burden on the European economy, on the airlines and not least on us consumers."
"The fault lies with outdated air traffic management and air traffic control and anachronistic national systems."
"All this has been known for a long time, like the expected doubling of the air traffic flow in the next fifteen years."
"And Parliament has issued strong calls for a change of course on many occasions."
"Without a qualitative improvement in the ATC-ATM systems, these problems will increase exponentially in coming years."
"Even if we decided right now to opt for a uniform system in introducing the most recent technology, it would still take about ten years to implement it."
"The solution we are seeking today must, therefore, be geared to the next thirty years."
"That is why we also need a qualitative improvement in relation to changing the institutional framework of Eurocontrol, as discussed in the White Paper."
"We need a uniform solution on a European basis, and we need it soon."
"The technical options exist, ranging from satellite-based navigation to the use of telematics in management."
"Nor should the financial cost of implementing them present any serious problem."
"I, for instance, could envisage a minimum tax on kerosene being imposed specifically for setting up this kind of ATC-ATM system."
"The savings such a system would engender would compensate for the extra burden on the airline companies."
"The main difficulty remains an institutional one and in principle it can therefore be resolved politically, provided we want to do so."
"Of course that would mean that the transport politicians would also have to understand that the airspace we gaze up at can no longer be seen as national."
"Looking ahead to the millennium, I think it would do us good to have a European wind or even gale behind us to impel us to resolve the airspace problems."
"I thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Cornelissen for his superb work in drafting this report and, as usual with him, in everything he does."
"I think that Parliament's position on the issue we are debating is well known."
"This House has on various occasions come out in favour of creating a single air traffic management system in Europe in order to avoid the current dispersal of control centres, national systems, suppliers of electronic supports, operational systems and programming languages."
"There is dispersal too when it comes to selecting technology and standardisation, and also in relation to responsibility between various international organisations and the Member States when decisions are needed on a global air traffic management policy."
"This dispersal must be avoided since it has adverse effects on the safety of air traffic, on the quality of the services provided to passengers and on the costs."
"It also has a negative effect on the environment as a result of the air traffic congestion it produces."
"Moreover, if significant changes are not made to the current situation, it will be impossible to cope with the increase in air traffic which it is calculated will amount, by the year 2010, to more than double the current traffic."
"Furthermore, we must be aware of the fact that about 10 years will be needed in order to plan and apply the measures necessary to achieve the harmonisation of air traffic management in Europe, since there are many difficult legal, institutional, political and technical barriers to be overcome."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I think that a strategic plan should be submitted urgently with a view to achieving the harmonisation of air traffic management and to ensuring that this management remains within the transEuropean transport network, since these objectives are impossible to achieve on the basis of the content of the White Paper because, as the rapporteur believes, the White Paper does not contain any practical measures or action programmes."
"Mr President, there are a great many dimensions to improving air traffic flow in Europe."
"Air traffic causes problems, and noise nuisance and damage to the environment are among the greatest."
"These must be solved both at national level and through European cooperation."
"This is very important to us in Finland, as we are geographically in a very vulnerable position as air traffic congestion increases."
"On long journeys by air, delays recur and onward connections become more difficult."
"The integration work which Mr Cornelissen has called for to solve the problems with the aid of a European air traffic management system deserves support."
"The situation can be improved by adopting more direct routes and developing the civil aviation systems of Eastern European countries."
"From Finland's point of view, greater involvement of the Baltic States, in particular, in European air traffic control cooperation is especially desirable."
"Consideration should also be given to what can be done to modernize the fleets of the former Soviet republics, in particular, and to improve air safety there; for example, pilots' proficiency in English, the international language of air traffic control, should be improved."
"A silent time-bomb is ticking away there, and the Union ought urgently to devote some of its resources to defusing it, in the manner of the TACIS and PHARE programmes."
"The situation should also be examined at national level."
"The benefits of coordination conferred by Eurocontrol and ATM, in whose work Finland also participates to some extent, are indisputable."
"However, they have not managed to harmonize their Member States' air traffic control systems or increase their safety."
"Finland is the only EU Member State which is still not a member of Eurocontrol."
"The reason lies in the fear that, inter alia, costs on internal routes might rise, military aviation might become subject to supervision, and it might become more difficult to subsidize little-used air-fields."
"Finland, the most northerly and easterly EU Member State, is rather large but sparsely populated, so that maintaining a dense and effective national air network is of vital importance to it."
"Despite centralization, the greatest responsibility lies with the individual Member States."
"Each country must itself shoulder its responsibility and invest, for example, the revenue from route levies so as to ensure that traffic flows smoothly within its own air space."
"The solution lies not only in the forum for European cooperation but close to those who suffer from the pollution and noise nuisance caused by congestion of air space."
"Mr President, I wish to add my voice to those Members who, in the course of this debate, have offered their tribute to Mr Pam Cornelissen for the way in which he has chaired the Committee on Transport and Tourism over the last two and a half years and, particularly in my case, the way he has done it over the last two years."
"Before I met Mr Cornelissen I had been known to use the phrase that we employ sometimes in English 'double Dutch' and to use it in a rather derogatory fashion in order to signify confused communication."
"Having met Mr Cornelissen and had the pleasure of working with him for two years, I can say that 'double Dutch' will also mean to me from now on twice as clear and twice as wise as any other statement - or almost all the time, in any case."
"I reserve the right to make an exception to my own rule on some occasions."
"I must say immediately that, of course, my view of 'double Dutch' also applies to Mr Florus Wijsenbeek."
"How could it be otherwise?"
"I value the judgement of Mr Cornelissen and his colleagues on this issue, as on others, and I am, therefore, particularly pleased that the report they have produced has given strong and broad endorsement to the Commission White Paper on air traffic management, which we called 'Freeing Europe's airspace' ."
"As I do not have to tell the House, the development and modernization of air traffic management is a vital issue to the millions of travellers in the European Union and, indeed, from elsewhere who use our airspace; to airlines, to airports and, indeed, to everyone associated with the industry."
"I hope, therefore, that we can look forward to substantial and speedy progress with the necessary improvements for all the reasons that have been outlined in such an effective way by Members who have contributed to the debate tonight."
"Since civil aviation in the Union has grown, is growing and will grow with great vitality over the next ten or fifteen years, it is essential that airspace management is continually improved to combat congestion, to sustain and indeed to advance safety in civil aviation and to reduce the environmental and economic costs that are very substantial and that, as several honourable Members have said, result from delays both on the ground and, indeed, in the air over the European Union."
"Members will recall that the efforts of recent years have secured some commendable changes since the crises of the late 1980s."
"The fact is, as Mr Cornelissen rightly reminded us this evening, that the number of delays has risen again over the last year and that must alert everyone against complacency and it must also spur all responsible authorities, including Member State governments, into working for sustained improvements in the management of European airspace."
"As part of the effort to achieve such improvement, the Commission has argued for several years that the European Community should have greater direct involvement in air traffic management affairs and this argument has been put forward at all times - so far as the Commission is concerned and this House is concerned - not because of aspirations to power or anything so small-minded but simply to provide practical solutions to chronic problems."
"That approach is clearly evident from the tone and the content of the White Paper which we produced in March last year, as it is indeed clear from the report we are considering tonight."
"In summary, the White Paper we produced outlined various widely-acknowledged shortcomings in the air traffic management arrangements at European level; it considered a variety of possible solutions and it came to the pragmatic conclusion that Eurocontrol - the organizational body which is currently primarily a provider of air traffic management services - should be given significant, new, additional legislative and regulatory responsibilities."
"The White Paper also emphasized that since many of these new responsibilities would cover areas of established Community competence, the Community itself should become a member of the new Eurocontrol in its own right."
"Members of the House will know that the Commission's initiative on air traffic management has been developing at the same time as the INSTAR study being undertaken by the European Civil Aviation Conference in which the Commission has been closely involved and to which we have, indeed, made significant financial contributions."
"It is now generally accepted that both initiatives will have important influence on the future European arrangements for ATM in terms of refining the responsibilities, powers and structures of Eurocontrol, and I am reasonably confident that the Commission's view of the future institutional arrangements for ATM at European level can be amalgamated with those of ECAC with particular regard to improving Eurocontrol, to majority voting to ensure effectiveness of decision-making, to enhanced coordination and improved information supply - all issues that have been raised in the course of tonight's debate by Mr Cornelissen and others - and, of course, Community participation."
"The major question of Community membership of the new Eurocontrol, which itself raises issues of competence, has, of course, not yet been resolved - as some honourable Members have noticed."
"However, this discussion will, we hope, be further progressed in the Transport Council under the current Dutch presidency and the Commission has recently produced draft negotiating directives which would give effect to the two main recommendations of the White Paper that I mentioned earlier in my contribution."
"I know that this Parliament, like many others, will maintain a very close interest in the Council decisions on the issue and I am, therefore, all the more grateful for the thorough and supportive report which Mr Cornelissen and his colleagues have made on the Commission's proposals."
"The least I shall do by way of reciprocation is, as Mr Cornelissen requested, to keep the House and the Transport Committee fully informed on all developments that take place, knowing that we have Parliament's support in our efforts to ensure the significant and urgent improvements that are necessary in air traffic management over the European Union."
"Mr President, I put a very clear question: the Dutch presidency apparently wants the EU to join Eurocontrol, as such, whilst paragraph 17 of the report refers to a new organization."
"What is the Commission's view?"
"As Mr Wijsenbeek will know from his reading of our White Paper, we came to the pragmatic conclusion that the best interests of all could be served by Community participation in what we call 'a new Eurocontrol' ."
"The Dutch presidency, to its credit, clearly acknowledges and understands that it is a new Eurocontrol of which we speak and which is the subject of discussion by the Member States."
"We look forward to continuing to have the support of the Dutch Government and the Transport Minister in particular, Mrs Jorritsma, in our efforts to ensure a convergence between the discussions taking place in ECAC and the proposals made - sensibly and productively, I believe - in our White Paper."
"We are glad to have the support of the House in these ventures."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Public transport and state aid"
"The next item is the report (A4-0419/96) by Mr Castricum, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on public transport and state aid."
"Mr President, many of our people feel that Europe is increasingly a matter of markets and money."
"There is less and less sympathy for that development."
"Whilst the benefits of freedom of movement for individuals, goods and services were formerly perceived as self-evident, it is the drawbacks which now seem to be receiving an increasingly high profile."
"Liberalization of the market and the consequences of striving towards a single currency are leading to uncertainties and doubts which are gnawing away at the roots of the Union."
"Against that background there is also a debate on public services, not least public transport."
"The owninitiative report we are now discussing was unanimously approved by the Transport Committee."
"Its scope can perhaps be broadened further if tomorrow we adopt the single amendment put down by Mr Wijsenbeek, and I recommend that we do so."
"In my report I sought to reconcile more harmoniously, across ideological lines, the primacy of government and the opportunities afforded by market forces."
"I hope I have more or less succeeded."
"In numerous documents, and recently the report on a citizens' network, Parliament has emphasized the social importance of public transport."
"The need for greater involvement of the European Union here is obvious, a logical consequence of the single market and of greatly increasing mobility, including mobility across borders."
"From the economic, ecological and social points of view it is absolutely vital that public transport should play a more prominent role."
"But at the same time we have to appreciate that mobility cannot be an absolute right."
"The report says in essence that political responsibility for public services must remain with governments, that a liberalized public transport market offers no guarantee at all that interconnected networks will function properly and that where circumstances change the interests of public transport workers must also be a central factor in those changes."
"The nub of the document is the idea that public transport in its broadest sense cannot function without state aid, but that a bottomless pit, if that is what we have, is better filled by a sensible policy."
"The citizen is entitled to public services, including public transport."
"The same citizen is also entitled, however, to expect that everything possible is done to organize and operate those services in a responsible manner."
"Financial efforts must be geared to getting results."
"Necessary rationalizations must be carried out in a socially responsible manner."
"In all this we must remember that research has shown that forms of support for public transport in the Member States of the Union vary very considerably."
"It would be a good thing if the initiative were taken to assemble comparable data and see if more comparability can be brought into quantities which are currently often not comparable."
"Slowly but surely this would make for a situation in which markets and money had their own place, but the interest of the citizen and the responsibility of the state were central."
"Lastly I should like to thank the Transport Committee for their constructive response to my draft report, and to all those who supplied the building bricks for it I am grateful for their cooperation and creative input."
"I am more than happy to echo the tribute paid earlier to Mr Cornelissen for his leadership of the Transport Committee during the first two and a half years of this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, I think that Mr Castricum's report makes a useful contribution to the debate on public transport."
"In Parliament, we frequently discuss the issues of public services and public transport."
"In a series of reports, the latter has been confirmed as being part of the network for our citizens."
"The report therefore does not deal with whether aid can be provided, but rather how it should be given, when it has been decided to grant aid for public transport."
"In general terms, it can be said that state aid which is given automatically, time after time, has been the cause of monopolies being created or maintained, and therefore should in principle be avoided."
"As we all know, we are on our way in that direction."
"However, it is important to make it clear that public transport is not always a profitable business."
"Large parts of the transport market have been liberalized."
"This means that transport is a problem in many places, especially in the sparsely populated areas."
"A model for solving this problem has not been found everywhere in the EU."
"With the adoption of this report, Parliament is establishing that we should be able to safeguard public transport, if we wish to keep this service."
"The requirement should therefore be that public involvement is transparent, and that it does not give rise to distortions of competition."
"In my opinion, we have overcome the hurdle whereby everything should be privatized and based on market forces."
"Now we are committing ourselves to the provision of a public service, a public service obligation, and I very much welcome that."
"Once again, I congratulate Mr Castricum on his report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group I thank Mr Castricum very warmly for his report."
"I think it is an excellent report, in which the European Parliament sets out its basic approach to the transport services which the towns, regions and Member States have to provide for their people and on the state aid that is also necessary to the provision of these public transport services."
"We Christian Democrats agree with the other groups in this House that the towns, regions and Member States must define the tasks of local or regional public transport in the interest of the general public and ensure they are carried out."
"Thank God the Social Democrats have managed to ensure that these public transport services are not necessarily to be provided by the public sector."
"Instead, towns and regions should contract out the transport services to the undertaking, whether public or private, that offers the most efficient, user-friendly and cheapest service and also provides it."
"If this House agrees on the principles, and I hope, Commissioner, that the Commission does not dispute them either, then we Christian Democrats, unlike the Social Democrats, see no need for the intergovernmental conference to draft a separate article giving a general definition of the public services and to include it in the Maastricht Treaty."
"Nor do we think it is in the public interest for the Commission to set out new legal bases."
"I am eager to hear whether the Commissioner believes it is essential for the European Commission and the European Community to draft new provisions."
"I believe that introducing new European Treaty Articles and legal provisions goes against the principle of subsidiarity."
"On the other hand, we Christian Democrats agree with the other groups in this House that the running costs of public transport must be financed largely through the fare and that where state aid is still required to cover shortfalls, this must be linked to efficiency and accessible to every supplier, be it a public or private transport undertaking."
"Where special infrastructure is required for local public transport, the construction and management costs may certainly be borne by the state, while the transport undertaking - and here we entirely agree with Mr Castricum - has to pay an appropriate amount for its use."
"I believe this House basically agrees on the principles."
"So we are now waiting for the Commissioner to tell us whether the European Commission also approves Mr Castricum's excellent report."
"Mr President, this report received broad, indeed unanimous, support from the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"A complement to it and to some extent a document which overlaps with it is the report on the 'Citizens' Network' which I myself had the pleasure of presenting at the November partsession."
"Despite Mr Castricum's willingness to support my amendment, and I am very grateful to him for that, I think there is a fine distinction between our two approaches."
"Firstly, are we or are we not to strive for what one might call systematic subsidizing?"
"Secondly, how far does the 'duty' to provide public services and public transport go?"
"I think we established in the Green Paper on the Citizens' Network that in certain situations we would be better off not having public transport in certain areas, but rather private transport which could be provided in accordance with need and which might even be given a measure of state aid."
"In any case, I think we agree on a number of areas and on the question which needs to be asked about how far a network must extend to qualify for subsidies and what constitutes a network."
"That is of course a very elastic concept and you might say that a network is the entire network of a Member State or merely a specific link within that Member State which is necessary in order to maintain a network."
"Mr President, support for any action which makes a universal public service possible, in other words public transport with guaranteed access to all citizens and which fulfils the objective of social interest, must be one of the main objectives pursued by Community action in the transport sector."
"The public service, whether provided by a public or private entity, must be regulated by rules laid down and endorsed by the Member States that make it possible to establish and develop an integrated, efficient and safe transport system, and which consequently promote the use of this by measures to improve the price-quality ratio of the services. This would make citizens aware and convince them of the very real potential advantages of using the public transport system."
"It is important to remember that the actual Treaty on European Union sets down explicitly the obligations of undertakings to guarantee a general economic interest service."
"It might perhaps be advisable that the guarantee in the next version of the Treaty on European Union, which will be produced at the end of this year, should refer more explicitly to the public service."
"Mr President, I should like to underline the importance of the guarantee of public transport for peripheral and rural regions, areas which are less developed and particularly weak as regards public transport networks."
"When providing a public service, more extensive transport networks should be considered and planned, in which peripheral regions and rural areas are included; these are perhaps less spectacular but of vital importance to the inhabitants."
"Therefore - and with this I will end - it is absolutely vital for the Commission to monitor constantly and investigate thoroughly the various aids which each State receives in the transport sector in order to assess properly the effect and implications of these."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is so much agreement about this no doubt quite excellent report by Mr Castricum that I need not take up much of your time."
"This report points towards future developments, not just in transport policy but also in relation to the merits of public and private services in general."
"A few years ago, people were still talking in terms of 'market versus state' and 'market or state' alternatives."
"Today, as this report makes clear, the aim is to find the best combination of market and state in order to provide the best possible services."
"Just as it is clear that services must be geared to the market, it is equally clear that this cannot be done entirely without subsidies or public contracts."
"This is particularly true in transport, whether urban, regional or cross-frontier."
"A few comments on this. Public undertakings must also realise that they have to produce for a market."
"In the past that was not often the case."
"Public undertakings have to reform."
"Only then can they expect the citizen to accept them."
"They have to do their own part too."
"Looking at railway undertakings in my own country: they have to make use of the land they own."
"They cannot just sit on it and expect that the state, meaning the people, will give them money so that they can pocket the subsidies."
"My second point is that the public authorities must respect the principle that the subsides they give should contain incentives; they should reduce the subsidies rather than allow public undertakings to take it as a matter of course that they receive a certain amount of money every year and, they hope, even more the following year."
"In that regard the report basically points in the right direction, which could also be set out and defined in an article in the Treaty, although good practice is more important than articles of principle."
"If Europe adopts this practice, it will be following the right road."
"Mr President, let me begin, as previous speakers have done, by thanking rapporteur Castricum for the work that he has put into this report."
"There are three points which I would like to emphasise as being particularly important in the discussion on public transport."
"The first may seem trivial but, it can truly be said that public transport is extremely important."
"It is one way of resolving congestion and environmental problems, but a number of conditions must be met, for example, public transport must be accessible."
"It must be available when needed, otherwise it will never be seen as an alternative to the private car."
"It must also be cheap, or at least competitively priced."
"Otherwise it will not be chosen by those embarking on a journey."
"The second important thing is that there must be competition."
"Public transport has all too rarely been opened up to competition from other types of public transport or from other operators on the public transport market."
"This is something which must be encouraged."
"Thirdly, it is important that we learn from each other."
"There are large discrepancies between Member States in the extent to which public transport is subsidised, perhaps because the service is purchased in very different ways."
"The average cost, if we take bus traffic in Sweden as an example, is 46 %. It is considerably higher in Belgium or the Netherlands."
"There is no reason to accept this in times of tight finances throughout the EU."
"I am convinced that, if we can meet the requirements, public transport has a significant and considerably more active role to play in the future."
"It is worth underlining, however, that we will only achieve this goal by making public transport better and more efficient, not by punishing motorists with more taxes."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by welcoming Parliament's initiative in bringing forward a report by Mr Castricum - and an excellent report it is - which provides an extensive and timely review of the important subject of the financing of public transport in the Union."
"It is clear to everyone that in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy high quality public transport which provides a real alternative to dependence on private cars is absolutely vital, and it is equally obvious that improvements in the efficiency of public transport and the transparency of public transport finances are therefore in the economic, social and environmental interests of the Community as a whole."
"As the House will be aware - and as Mr Castricum and indeed Mr Wijsenbeek reminded us - we have sought to articulate that with our Commission Green Paper on the citizens' network produced about this time last year which outlines a comprehensive strategy to fulfil the potential of public transport and to cover amongst other things, the need to review some existing rules, including those concerning financing."
"A White Paper on a strategy for revitalizing the railways also analysed the improvements required in the way that most of the Union's railways are financed as part of the efforts we believe are needed to enable rail to increase its role successfully in our public transport system."
"Thirdly, as a further example of common objectives and common thinking between the Commission and Parliament, our recent Commission communication on services of general interest gave transport as an example of a sector where the Community had adopted a specific approach designed to take account of public service needs."
"Because of time constraints, I should like very briefly to set out how the Commission sees the general issue of public transport financing before I make a few specific comments on the report before us tonight."
"Firstly, as Mr Castricum's report makes clear, we should not forget that many excellent privately and publicly-owned public transport services are provided without any financial support from public resources."
"Services that are welldesigned, well-run and affordable to travellers are obviously more likely to attract fare-paying passengers in the numbers that are needed to cover costs."
"We make that basic but significant point in the citizens' network Green Paper."
"There are, nevertheless, other cases where public authorities, quite rightly, take the view that there is a public need for a service which is not necessarily viable in purely commercial terms in urban areas and, as several Members have said in the debate, in rural areas too."
"In such cases it is clearly appropriate and necessary for public authorities to finance some services provided by operators of public transport and it is worth stressing that such financing is not, strictly speaking, state aid."
"The decision about whether or not to finance those services is for all the obvious reasons best taken by competent and accountable authorities in Member States."
"However, the Commission, too, has clear responsibilities."
"Firstly, to try to establish a legal framework that is appropriate to the circumstances facing public transport throughout the Union."
"Secondly, to lay down the provisions necessary to ensure that payments for public service are not used as a hidden and unaccountable method of covering losses caused by inefficiency, and that such support is proportionate and that 'transparent' means for essential specified services provided for society at large."
"Similarly, it is often appropriate for public authorities to contribute to the cost of public transport infrastructure projects since it is clear that whilst, in a variety of direct and indirect ways, users make a payment for the transport infrastructure that they use, such payments are not always enough to cover full costs."
"As far as Member State financing is concerned, state aid should contribute to the development of public transport in the common interest, and the Commission shares the thinking of the draft resolution about increasing transparency in the financing of public transport, especially by improving the data provided in the annual competition report and in state aid reports."
"Time forbids me from responding at length to Mr Castricum's report but I would like to reply to the particular suggestion of including in the Treaty an article specifically concerned with public services - an issue raised again tonight by Mr Castricum and, indeed, by Mr Jarzembowski."
"I have to tell the House that the Commission does not share the view that a new legal basis of the kind suggested is necessary."
"Instead, in our communication on services of general interest, we advocated that a reference should be inserted in Article 3 of the present Treaty to the effect that a specific activity of the Community should be a contribution to the promotion of services of general interest."
"This approach is certainly valid in the case of transport, where the right balance between liberalization and general interest is provided not only by Article 90 of the Treaty as it stands but also by the sectorbased Article 77."
"I hope that on reflection the House will agree that this is the most practical approach to achieving the objective expressed in the draft resolution, an objective with which I have to say that I broadly sympathize."
"More generally, I can assure the committee that the Commission is continually working to improve and to try to complete, the existing rules concerning public transport."
"Whilst fully respecting the subsidiarity principle, we also take account of course of the problems which can arise in frontier regions and other regions with specific transport requirements."
"Like many others involved in this debate, my colleagues and I believe that public transport has an essential role to play in tackling the problems of congestion, pollution and transport safety, and getting the rules right is patently an important part of achieving that."
"That is another reason for welcoming Mr Castricum's report and consequently I commend it warmly to the House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.15 a.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have a question and a comment concerning page 7 of the Minutes, at least in the Dutch version."
"I refer to the letter from Mr Pasty to President H√§nsch which was read out yesterday by the President. And particularly to the following sentence: ' I am therfore entitled to wonder what the real reasons behind this letter (of President H√§nsch's) are and what its purpose is.'"
"We heard the text yesterday, of course, but perhaps not everybody took it fully on board."
"There is a clear insinuation here against the integrity of the President of Parliament."
"My personal reaction to this is that I consider it a disgraceful letter and I ask myself, and I ask you and the Bureau of Parliament too, whether Members can be allowed to question the integrity of Parliament's President in this manner with impunity?"
"In other words: can he get away with this?"
"Are such procedures acceptable in this House or not?"
"My own view is that this is quite disgraceful and unacceptable."
"I ask you to put this question to the Bureau: is it acceptable for the integrity of Parliament's President to be questioned in this way?"
"If not, I think the Bureau should consider the consequences."
"Mr Metten, your comments are not related to the Minutes but to the interpretation of what was said or maintained yesterday."
"I note your observation."
"It goes without saying that from the Chair I cannot accept any doubt about the integrity of the President or whoever was in the Chair at the time, and that is a position with which the entire House agrees."
"Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to an error in the Minutes."
"During the debate with the President-in-Office of the Council I did not complain that he had not answered the questions put by a Dutch Member but that he had not replied to my questions on Serbia."
"That would make more sense."
"Mrs Pack, you are absolutely correct. We will see that it is put right."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"The point I wish to raise concerns Rule 19 - Duties of the President - and specifically Rule 19(4) which states that: ' Parliament shall be represented in international relations, on ceremonial occasions and in administrative, legal or financial matters by the President, who may delegate these powers.'"
"Two days ago the Legal Service of Parliament, acting as the agents of the House and, under that power of delegation, made a presentation to the European Court of Justice in respect of a case brought by Eurotunnel on the sensitive question of duty-free sales."
"I wish to put on record, as someone who has a long-standing interest in that policy question, that I ask whether I am entitled to receive a copy of the written and oral submissions which were made on behalf of the House on an issue which is of grave concern to many Members."
"Secondly, I wish to place on record that, in respect of the reports which I have heard on the question of the oral submission, I find a number of points within that submission quite disturbing in terms of interpretation of the will of Parliament."
"For that reason, I wish to ask, firstly, as I have done already, for copies and, secondly, to ask, not necessarily now but perhaps to be advised at your discretion in writing, what procedures are open to a Member of the House to follow through."
"If this were the Commission or the Council, I could table a question - I could look for an oral question with debate."
"But, since it is our own institution, how does the institution account to itself in the matter of delegated powers?"
"Mr Cox, I take note of your request."
"You have raised an issue that would require much debate at this time to be made clear."
"I recommend that you address a letter or table a question so that you can receive an absolutely prepared and serious answer."
"The matter is a serious one and must be considered very carefully."
"May I remind speakers that they must not speak for longer than one minute."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Fisheries Council of 19/20 December 1996"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the outcome of the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Fisheries of 19-20 December 1996."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too have appreciated the points that you, Mrs Bonino, have put to the House."
"But, like other colleagues, I have to say I regret the fact that there was no debate at the last partsession on an issue as important as MAGP IV which could, in that way, have been analysed more closely."
"Naturally, as Members of Parliament, we asked for an opportunity of holding a debate in this Chamber because, as a result of problems of organization of work, the debate could not be held in the usual manner."
"Of course, the outcome of the Council meeting is, in some respects, contradictory: on the one hand there are some positive strands, such as the approval in principle of the proposal to reconvert the swordfish fleet which concerns Italy: this is an important decision making the reconversion of that fleet with a significant environmental impact on the Mediterranean part of a possible solution."
"And the problem of satellite monitoring has also been resolved. In that connection, Commissioner, you mentioned the problem of satellite monitoring which is very important and less expensive in technological terms also."
"I would also point out that we are providing a response to safety issues also in this way: satellite monitoring may offer important possibilities as regards safety and, of course, checks on vessels."
"I move on now to the more difficult issue: we need the results of MAGP III, Commissioner, as they are, of course, important when it comes to following up the work done and programming MAGP IV."
"There is no doubt that reconciling conservation of stocks with the need to maintain a strategic position in the fishing sector is a complicated and difficult issue."
"From that point of view, the socio-economic conditions have, of course, to be assessed, and this is an area in which the Council should, in my view, be doing more."
"Parliament has already worked towards this and we Socialists firmly believe that reconversion should take account of socio-economic conditions."
"And so I believe it is important that we continue along that path in the future also."
"May I wish the Bureau and the Fisheries Directorate of the Commission a happy new year?"
"It was indeed very regrettable that we were unable to have a proper debate last December with you, Mrs Bonino."
"Today we have to debate with you and your fisheries directorate how we can make progress in the common fisheries policy, convinced that fisheries is an important branch of industry in the European Union, especially in the many coastal regions of Europe dependent on this industry for jobs."
"It is very regrettable, as you said, that at the Council meeting in December valuable time was lost arguing about the allocation of possible fish, which may not longer exist, rather than spending the time on dossiers on which Parliament had already expressed its view."
"We of course welcome the agreement on satellite monitoring, even although it is only the largest boats that are equipped with this new technology."
"This fleet which is relatively small but nonetheless important for the EU fishing is at least a start in the new technologies."
"Mr Bonino, you said we must act decisively if the fishing industry is to survive in the long term in the EU."
"My group supports you in that view."
"I should like to ask you, as you have asked us, to work closely together with us to find a solution."
"Otherwise the crisis in the fisheries sector will not finish, but fishing will."
"I am quite worried that the present texts being discussed in the Council of Ministers differ considerably from those on which Parliament was consulted."
"I urge the Commission to respect the right of this House to a further consultation."
"We welcome the proposal not just to simplify but also improve the technical measures for stock conservation: nets with larger meshes, more selective nets with square mesh panels where appropriate and the principle of closed areas are essential principles if juvenile fish are to be given a better chance of surviving."
"The Council of Ministers will be failing in its duty if it does not act immediately or it if waters down the proposals."
"A transitional solution will only waste valuable time."
"The fishermen have told us clearly that they want conservation measures."
"Now we learn today that the Council of Ministers is unwilling to agree to measures for a proper reduction in the fish catch and in the fleet's capacity."
"Both are needed to restore a balance in the available resources, as you have said."
"The dangers are real and serious if we do not take control of the situation."
"Other political forces will dictate action and force their ideas on the fishing industry, including some which want to close down the fishing sector."
"The remaining months until the North Sea Protection Conference will prove this and public opinion will be manipulated."
"At the end of the day fishermen will be isolated."
"That means that we must change our whole way of thinking."
"In the excellent hearing organised by our splendid former chairman, Mr Arias Ca√±ete, one thing was obvious from the start: the chase for fish will continue mercilessly if we do not solve the crisis once and for all."
"For far too long we have been hearing only bad news about the present management of the fishing resources."
"But we also heard some good news at the hearings."
"The industry is often prepared to take account of lasting use of resources and thereby put an end to this destructive chase."
"New Zealand and Iceland are good examples here."
"I urge you to take their positive experience on board and present suitable proposals to this House."
"We are fortunate to have Carmen Fraga as the new chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and as rapporteur on the future of the common European fisheries policy from the year 2000."
"I firmly believe that if we all pull together and are guided by realism then the fisheries industry has a future."
"I am very curious to see what emerges from the Committee on Fisheries in the next two and a half years."
"Mr President, at the outset I want to say that I welcome the opportunity of discussing aspects of the fishing industry here in Parliament this morning."
"I recall the situation in December last year when we did not have the opportunity of discussing reports such as the Souchet and Kofoed reports and the aborted Escudero reports on technical conservation measures."
"So it is essential that we have this opportunity of highlighting the importance of fishing and the problems confronting the fishing industry throughout Europe."
"I do not want to take too much time on TACs and quotas but I should like to thank the Commission for making available to us the details after the meeting on 19 and 20 December."
"It is important that Members of this House and in particular members of the Committee on Fisheries be fully briefed at all times in relation to ongoing developments."
"I want to refer very quickly to the satellite system which all of us support in principle."
"I am pleased that good sense prevailed both within the Commission and within the Council and that the presidency compromise was eventually accepted."
"There will not therefore be a burden on vessels under 20 metres."
"There will not be a burden on vessels fishing in inshore waters where they are at sea no longer than 24 hours."
"I am also pleased that financial assistance will be available to those who will find it necessary to install such apparatus in their vessels."
"Surely it is logical that the satellite regulation and system would apply to those boats."
"The bulk of their fishing is spent outside flagship waters."
"All of us support the principle of technical conservation measures to reduce the catch of juvenile fish to ensure that the fishing industry will survive for this and future generations."
"We must ensure that we limit the fishing activity in certain areas and certain seasons where juvenile fish are abundant."
"We must support the question of closed areas."
"We must support minimum landing and the square mesh panel."
"But we must also ensure that the regulations are simple and can be readily understood by fishermen and that any research that is carried out is done under commercial conditions."
"I am pleased that we will have a further opportunity to discuss technical conservation measures before any decision is taken."
"This brings me to my fourth point."
"In European terms my country has a small fleet both in size and numbers."
"Capacity cuts is not an option for Ireland."
"The tonnage ceiling was established at a time when the industry was very much in its infancy, largely an inshore fleet."
"As in all countries, our fishing takes place in coastal regions where there is no alternative source of employment."
"The constituency I represent is an Objective 1 region."
"This factor must be taken into consideration."
"The broad brush approach is neither practical nor realistic."
"In conclusion, I say to the Commissioner, accompanying measures must be put in place but they should not come from the existing structural funds."
"Mr President, I also would like to thank the Commissioner for her extensive description of the Council meeting, which is most important."
"I am also pleased to see that she looks so well."
"It was widely reported in the British press that she only just survived the end of the meeting."
"We are glad to see you here, your usual active self."
"Briefly, concerning the satellite issue, a fairly minor but an important milestone, the most important thing here is that much of the industry has been against this."
"Obviously they do not like the 'spy in the sky' ."
"I come from the freight industry where we have had the tachograph for years."
"One thing I have learnt is that people soon learn how to abuse and get round these systems."
"It is always a question of staying one step ahead."
"So I would be interested in the Commissioner's views on making sure that there is uniform application and ensuring that the system is implemented properly throughout the Union on these vessels."
"She has a great problem in terms of inspection resources."
"These need to be used to help that process, but there is always a question of abuse."
"Regarding TACs and quotas, again I would raise the strategic problem here of ministers debating with scientists through the Commission and coming up with a compromise that allows all ministers to claim victory, while at the same time, scientists are trying to make decisions on the actual scientific state of the stocks."
"This seems to me to be a process that will not work, is not right."
"Sometimes I wonder whether most of ministers' time is spent trying to design their press releases to say that they have all won for their own industries."
"I feel that we need to move to a process, to be honest, where we keep the politicians out of this process; where, at the end of the day, maybe the ministers can say 'yes' or 'no' to the solution but cannot actually negotiate it themselves because we are just going to have a situation where the environment is put on the back burner and we are just looking for political victories."
"As far as MAGP IV is concerned, I am not surprised that we have had to put this off again until April."
"That is regrettable because the industry needs to know its future."
"But I think it is partly an indication of the fact that this particular programme, like the previous ones, will not actually work."
"I am interested that the Commission has put in a sanction to say that there will be no payments through FIFG until this is agreed."
"I think that is, in a way, the right approach. But I believe that the only way that rationalization can take place is if the industry itself decides how to do it, given a very strict environmental framework within which it has to work."
"The most important aspect of investment for vessels in the future is not that the EU should provide money for reinvestment."
"That is completely wrong."
"It is all about the industry understanding what its future will be and then private investment will come into the industry."
"Lastly, I regretted very much, as far as the Mediterranean is concerned, that there was a complete defeat for the Commission, it would seem to me, on the swordfish issue - in that sort of area there was a complete sell-out."
"I would ask the Commissioner what she intends to do in the first half of 1997 to start to bring forward the debate about the common fisheries policy post-2000?"
"Mr President, I personally think that the determined opposition by fishermen and shipowners from various Member States of the European Union to the Commission proposal for MAGP IV was decisive for the position adopted by the European Parliament in the last part-session, just as I think that this firm attitude was also important for the Fisheries Council, held on 19 and 20 December, which decided to adopt and work out new proposals to be approved in principle in the first months of 1997."
"I hope, for my part, however, that the practical solutions which are adopted do correspond to the declarations made at the end of that Council and that generally speaking, albeit with contradictions, they do seem to be in keeping with the tenor of the discussion which we have been holding in the European Parliament for a number of months."
"Therefore it is fundamental that the new proposals do not once again insist on unacceptable reductions which cannot be justified in the fishing fleet or the imposition of new reductions in the number of boats, together with measures for a permanent and thorough monitoring of species evolution, and include effective forms of controlling fishery fleets and their respective techniques, providing for additional financial means to compensate for income loss, defend and support non-industrial coastal fishing, and the social stability of fishing communities and the direct and indirect employment provided."
"Madam Commissioner, I should like to put another question to you because I think that it might be related to this."
"I am referring in particular to recent declarations made by the Moroccan Government which suggest that it intends to increase unilaterally from two to four months the biological moratorium included in the current Fisheries Agreement which, if carried out, would be exclusively applicable to Community boats, in other words Portuguese and Spanish boats, just like the declared intention not to renew an agreement which, if I remember right, was established little more than one year ago."
"Declarations of this type from the Moroccan authorities in my opinion are quite worrying and unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable that we tell the peoples of the Iberian countries that this Fisheries Agreement was not negotiated in close association with the Trading Association Agreement established with Morocco, also in 1995, and that many of the trading concessions made then in terms of fish preserves and farming products, which had very serious repercussions on certain European Union Member States, were not used as bargaining chips in order to create conditions in order to renew the Fisheries Agreement."
"This close relationship between the negotiation of the two Agreements cannot be denied and it has even been mentioned by some people to justify and defend the respective approval, especially when we were discussing the terms of the Commercial Association Agreement with Morocco."
"It is important for the Commissioner to give us her opinion on this question and tell us how, if at all, it is going to be dealt with as part of the new proposals to be studied and presented in 1997, since the Moroccan Government's positions - if put into practice - would naturally imply changes which the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets could never have imagined one month ago."
"For our part, we think that it is unacceptable to change the periods of biological moratoria agreed in 1995."
"In other words, we would like to hear your opinions on this matter."
"Mr President, Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years, dealing with three areas in fisheries management: first, the size of the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission; and satellite transponders, an important aspect of the overall control programme."
"In addition, the annual TACs were decided."
"These meetings afforded a rare opportunity to take decisive action to rectify the dangerous situation of the EU fisheries."
"Unfortunately the Council did not have the courage to make the difficult decisions which need to be made."
"On the MAGP, everybody admits that the EU fishing fleets are too large."
"Even the fishing industry itself says that there is overcapacity and that reductions are necessary."
"However, the Council continues to resist the idea."
"It currently seems to be attempting to turn MAGP from a programme to reduce fishing fleet capacity by decommissioning, scrapping etc., into a programme to limit the fishing efforts which the fleets are allowed to make."
"This amounts to a fundamental reorientation of the goal of the programme and one which, in our opinion, is bound to fail."
"There are several reasons why this failure is inevitable. I will mention just two."
"First, fishing vessels are built to fish, so fishing vessel owners are not going to be happy with their vessels sitting idle and losing money."
"They will exert pressure on politicians to allow them to go fishing to try and make some money."
"The extent of the pressure which can be put on politicians is known to us all and can be seen in the results of the annual Council meeting where TACs are decided."
"So even if the Council was able, in its wisdom, to accept a programme to limit fishing effort, that would not end the story, for there would be ever-increasing demands from the industry to allow more fishing."
"Secondly, such a programme would be extraordinarily difficult to monitor or control."
"Last year I was rapporteur for the report on the CFP monitoring system."
"You will recall that fisheries control is the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission."
"The basic conclusion of the review conducted by the Commission was that the control programmes in the Member States were totally inadequate and in dire need of improvement."
"No country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas."
"It was interesting that the Commission recorded that several countries had failed to meet targets in the statistics on the size and capacity of the national fleets."
"Instances were found where vessels were larger in reality than was actually indicated in the national registry of vessels."
"So I would pose the question: how can we be confident that a programme to control the fishing effort of a large and powerful fleet would be successful?"
"We have not even managed to control the amount of fish which is landed, and that is a far simpler task."
"One agreement has been reached on how much capacity is to be reduced."
"Another aspect which is important is what capacity is to eliminated."
"We must ensure that the vessels which remain in the fleets are those which are the least destructive to the marine environment."
"This would have long-term beneficial consequences for both the fish stocks and for the fishermen."
"A final matter which gets very little attention is what is done with the vessels."
"EU fleets are already active in many oceans around the world and often cause considerable damage."
"Considering the size of the other fleets in the world, there is not a great deal of room in other areas to which these vessels can go without causing problems."
"The decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world."
"Europe must not be allowed to export its excess capacity."
"In short, the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis."
"The technical measures are all about trying to increase the selectivity of EU fishing practices."
"This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important, targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen."
"The fact that the FAO estimates that, on a global basis, one tonne of fish is thrown away for every three tonnes that is kept shows that this is a very serious problem."
"The Commission has proposed a number of progressive changes in the current technical measures including square mesh panel, increase in mesh size, grates or grids to filter out the shrimp catches and others."
"Once again, the Council is shilly-shallying, working on a compromise version which will weaken the Commission proposal."
"The fishing industry is being held accountable for the damage it wreaks on the marine community."
"The proposals of the Commission are a significant step along the path towards a more responsible approach to fishing activities."
"The Council seems bent, unfortunately, on ignoring wider public opinion in Europe and around the world, which is in favour of a more careful and precautionary approach to fishing, and is choosing to bow to the pressure of the fishing industry."
"Mr President, unlike you I was glad that Mrs Bonino had twenty minutes to talk to us."
"I just wish that I had twenty minutes as well because there are many issues which are very important."
"I want to make some brief points."
"Firstly, the Northern Irish fishermen were compensated by the British Government during the negotiations."
"I should like to know where the fish came from that went to Northern Ireland as part of a political deal which the Conservative Government had to stitch up with the Ulster Unionists."
"Secondly, there are a couple of problems I want to flag up: one is that the salmon importation from Norway is a problem which will not go away."
"I would apportion the blame between the British Government and the Commission for not imposing a minimum import price."
"If they had asked for it earlier, they could have had it but, as the Commissioner says, there is an ongoing investigation and I understand her position."
"However, there is a worry that the prices might take a nose dive now."
"I want some reassurance that this will be taken into account."
"Thirdly, the problem of the size of the UK fleet."
"This is a major problem first of all because of flags of convenience - a problem mishandled by the UK in the past - and also because of the failure on the part of the UK to decommission."
"There is a major problem there which I want to flag up."
"I have one or two complimentary things to say."
"It is very good that Mrs Bonino comes to us now after the debacle at the end of December and says: ' Let us now talk seriously about the conservation measures, about MAGP IV' ."
"The things which we knew were not going to be implemented in December we can now discuss in a realistic way and we have time for a constructive dialogue which will take into account the views of the fishing sector."
"I am glad also that the small-scale coastal fishing sector has been exempted from satellite monitoring."
"That is very important both symbolically and in practice."
"That is the way we have to go in the future; giving that sector the priority."
"Finally, I turn to the promise that there will be compensation through accompanying measures for any losses which are inflicted on the fisheries sector."
"For a long time the farming sector has expected this as of right and the fishing sector has had to survive somehow."
"I am glad to hear that this is built into the thinking and we will be looking for further specifications along those lines."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the Commissioner's appearance in Parliament today and I think we would all welcome even more appearances by the Commissioner to discuss fisheries, because this has not received the amount of discussion it should have had over the years - and certainly not last year."
"As far as TACs and quotas are concerned, it is a bit like the curate's egg: it was good in parts."
"But I have to question the whole situation last year."
"The Commission statement on sweeping cuts in the fishing industry right throughout Europe unnecessarily alarmed fishermen."
"Surely, in this modern day and age there is a better way in which we can carry this out?"
"Is it not time for the Commission, Parliament, the Council, the fishermen and the scientists to approach this in a better way?"
"Is it not time that the scientists and the fishermen got together instead of having the conflicting evidence that we always have?"
"Because, Commissioner, we both know that by August, September, October, November and December of this year, we will go through the whole process again!"
"Nothing has been solved!"
"We will just simply be covering the same ground again."
"So I would certainly call for a different approach and a different and more constructive attitude by everyone concerned."
"I welcome the decision to have satellite monitoring on larger boats, and not imposed on the inshore fishermen as well - it was a very wise decision to accept that compromise by the Council and the Commission."
"I also wish to say very clearly to Mr Macartney - in case he is worried - that there was no stitch-up between the British Government and the Ulster Unionists before the Council meeting!"
"There was no stitch-up at all: it was just good negotiations."
"Perhaps, if some of the people in Mr Macartney's party had the same skill in negotiations as the people in my party have in Westminster, then his fishermen might benefit as much as my fishermen in Northern Ireland did."
"I wish to pay tribute to the UK Government and to the leader of my party for being able to achieve that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during their meeting in Brussels on 19 and 20 December last, the Fisheries Ministers reached an agreement on satellite monitoring, on TACs and quotas."
"They postponed until April 1997 their decision on the plan to reduce the EU fishing fleet known as 'MAGP-IV' ."
"Let me go back over two points in the agreement."
"The introduction of a satellite monitoring system for European vessels inevitably calls to mind satellite monitoring of agricultural set-aside or the number of cows per hectare."
"It is the most sophisticated method available to the Community bureaucracy."
"This is of course being done under the cloak of technical and safety considerations: the identification and location of fishing vessels and, in cases of distress or shipwreck, helping them as quickly as possible."
"These measures, costing ECU 205 million over five years, would have more impact and more credibility with Community fishermen if they were applied to all vessels fishing in the territorial waters of the Community, since only ships equipped with the famous blue boxes can be located and hence monitored and possibly penalized."
"The other point agreed by the Fisheries Ministers was an increase in TACs over those initially proposed by the Commission."
"Out of 116 TACs, only 30 were changed from last year's levels."
"Behind the technical debate on the conservation of fishery resources and the reproduction of species lies a political question that can be summarized as follows: do we want to sacrifice the common fisheries policy on the altar of world-wide free trade?"
"But in the age of the WTO and the globalization of trade, the European Union is alone in respecting certain social, technical and environmental standards in fishing."
"Community fishermen should not be paying the price of unilateral concessions negotiated by the European Commission in their name."
"Mr President, if we just stand back for a moment and look at all the discussions that have taken place in the fisheries sector in recent months, there is one thing that stands out above everything else and that is that the industry has completely lost confidence in the assessment of the stocks of the different fish - that is one thing that comes through in all the things that I have read."
"I know from the fishermen in my own constituency that they have no confidence at all in the scientific advice that is being received on stock levels."
"I should just like to quote from the Annual Report of the Anglo-Scottish Fish Producers' Association, which states very bluntly: ' We must continue to question the advice of scientists regarding stock levels.'"
"There is also the fact that the quota system is not operating to suit market demands."
"Fishermen are under pressure to catch the quotas for fear of cuts in the following year's allocation."
"One of the results is that we are seeing a higher proportion of smaller fish being caught - still legally, but the proportion of smaller fish is increasing, and so are the market withdrawals."
"Last year's figures for my region showed that haddock withdrawals increased by 50 % and whiting withdrawals were up by 30 %."
"We urgently need to get away from the 'catch it or lose it' mentality."
"I would urge the Commission to take on board the fact that we need a new approach to stock assessment and quota setting."
"Unless we have confidence in a new approach, we cannot possibly hope to construct an effective regional management system."
"Mr President, first I want to thank the Commissioner for being here to tell us the results of the last Fisheries Council, and for her readiness to debate them with the European Parliament."
"But unfortunately, although that Council was important a priori , we cannot really talk about results, because nothing was decided except the TACs and quotas."
"It was a disappointing Council at which MAGP IV was postponed until April, the regulations for technical measures have an even vaguer timetable, and the satellite monitoring project - crippled in my view - also awaits final approval."
"All this means we are about to lose a year in providing the sector with three instruments fundamental to its management and development."
"This is plain weakness on the part of the Council, demonstrating its lack of harmony with the Commission and, while the latter may be guilty of putting forward certain projects that are unrealistic, confused and lacking the necessary advance compromise, the Council can be accused of indecisiveness and of being led more by the special interests of the Member States than by genuine determination to make progress with fisheries legislation that is coherent and has a future."
"We see it every year in the blatantly political outcome of the TACs."
"But it is on the issue of the MAGP that I need the greatest possible clarification because, although I have no doubt that the pressure from the Council must have been very strong, that is also where I think the Commission has done its worst work."
"Even admitting - as I have always done - that a reduction of the fleet is essential, the proposal was extreme and highly questionable scientifically."
"It was one of the priority issues of the year, calling for great flexibility and capacity for compromise, but the Commission proved incapable of dialogue and perhaps lacked common sense."
"It is obvious, Madam Commissioner - and this House is tired of repeating it - that when the fleet is asked to make the kind of sacrifices contained in this project, it must either come equipped with serious and guaranteed socio-economic measures or it will be condemned to failure."
"Furthermore, this Parliament is still not clear whether some MAGPs are generically based on a reduction in strength, whether they maintain minimum determination about the need to reduce capacity, or whether the project is tenuous and mixed, with initiative left to the States in principle, and the Commission making the decisions later."
"We have heard widely differing interpretations from your department and the only thing that is certain at the moment is that the fleet does not know for certain what kind of measures it is going to have to submit to and nobody seems to be able to explain them clearly."
"With the Council in deadlock, the Commission's reaction was to force approval by threatening to withdraw the structural funds for construction and modernization. Quite apart from the legal questions that raises, it was politically out of order and has proved to be a mistake."
"I have openly criticized the Council's attitude, Madam Commissioner."
"But when the Commission has to resort to that kind of threat, the obvious absence of harmony is too serious to be overlooked and the Commission shares responsibility for that."
"On the other hand, the decision is intolerable and unjust for countries which have complied with the MAGP, because they are the ones best placed to fulfil the subsequent ones."
"How can good and bad pupils be lumped together?"
"Not one single serious measure has ever been taken to penalize the non-compliers, which could not receive funds for that very reason, and now a measure is introduced which is exclusively directed at punishing the countries that have taken Community measures seriously."
"The situation is worthy of Kafka, Madam Commissioner and I want to ask you to consider the request to restore access to the structural funds, at least to the countries which have complied with the reductions in capacity imposed by the European Union."
"I would have liked to comment on all the other matters dealt with by the Council but as time is short I will not burden Parliament with further issues."
"Thank you again for being here, Madam Commissioner, and for shedding so much light on these matters."
"Mr President, I would like to note two encouraging aspects of the decisions taken at the December Fisheries Council."
"First the announcement, within a year, of more flexible quota management."
"Taking into account the rate at which quotas are used is an essential and too often neglected factor in the conservation of the resource."
"It is imperative that we seek the greatest possible flexibility, otherwise Member States and the producer organizations will tend to use up their quotas to the full so as to avoid being penalized later, and reprehensible practices like the diversion of quotas will be encouraged."
"The second positive aspect is the improvement in the accuracy and fairness of monitoring thanks to the adoption of satellite observation, for large ships only of course."
"I am delighted at the adoption by the Council of many amendments I submitted to the Committee on Fisheries which had been adopted by this Parliament."
"On the other hand, the Commission's attitude, using a form of blackmail by suspending aid for the building and modernization of ships to try and force Member States to adopt a plan for a massive reduction in fleets, seems to me to be extremely dangerous."
"People in coastal regions know that many shipyards are now on a knife-edge."
"Blockage by the Commission could endanger many of them, since their future now depends on orders benefiting from FIFG aid."
"The disappearance of these yards would mean considerable job losses in our countries and the irreparable loss of very valuable European know-how."
"As for the technical measures, they must be carefully tested before any general use and all factors must have been taken into account, particularly the selectivity and energy consumption of the different types of fishing gear."
"Finally, the common fisheries policy must not be confined exclusively to issues under the three headings of monitoring, capacities and technical measures."
"It must be directed to redefining the concept of Community preference in order to achieve better price control."
"The absence of Community preference, coupled with an overliberal policy on import controls, can only encourage overfishing."
"The best protection for the resource is a fair price for the products of European fisheries which will also be, Mr President, the best guarantee for the future of a thriving fishing industry in our countries."
"Mr President, I thought I was down to speak earlier but I see that the big transfer fee from the EPP to the Goldsmith Group got in first."
"The Council meeting was quite a mixed bag."
"There are some positive features which many Members have commented upon, in particular the introduction of satellite surveillance, along with the flexibility allowing the industry to roll on quotas into the next year and take them off quotas for the following year."
"This is very much welcomed by the industry."
"There were other areas where it was obviously thought that discretion was the better part of valour and it was decided to postpone decisions, in particular in MAGP IV."
"We welcome that too."
"Industry felt that the proposals on which the Commission had based their original proposals were seriously flawed."
"The one area where I would take issue with the Commission in particular, though also with the Council, is the matter Mr Macartney alluded to concerning salmon."
"This issue will not go away."
"Some regions have been dumping salmon for ten years in the European Union and it is not a new issue."
"We have frequently had debates and discussions and passed resolutions; the Commission reluctantly introduced a minimum import price a couple of years ago and then let it go after a time and did not reintroduce it."
"I would like to put it to the Commissioner that she lost the battle with her colleague Sir Leon Brittan on this because we understand that he is not very enthusiastic about dealing with the Norwegians and does not want to introduce restrictions."
"He is frightened it might cause problems under the EEA agreement while we in the Committee on Fisheries and many people in Parliament take a different view."
"Apart from that issue, if I were giving the Commissioner a mark for her endeavours at the Council meeting I would give her 6 out of 10."
"Mr President, if you watch the language groups that are participating in this debate you will see that there is a lot of pressure in the north-west of the Community on the fishing industry and deep concern, which is reflected here."
"I welcome the presence of the Commissioner and want to say we were proud and a little sad to note that she worked herself into the ground before Christmas on fishing problems."
"We are happy that she is here this morning and has given a very full explanation of what she has undertaken."
"In the past, and in particular in the north-west of the Community, there has been deep suspicion in the fishing industry about how fishing policy was conducted and managed and a deep lack of trust."
"It is good that the Commissioner comes here and gives us full explanations and she is entitled to our support for the long-term objectives which she has set out."
"It is only when we receive full explanations that we can give this support."
"The lack of trust in the fishing industry in Scotland and Ireland - and it is also true of Spain - is to be regretted."
"We were disappointed that we did not have some sort of minimum price fixing on imported salmon before the Christmas period."
"That is the period in which Scottish and Irish fishermen sell a lot of their produce and the prices at the end of the year are extremely important to them."
"Since a prima facie case had been made, we thought it would have been possible but we look forward at least to a satisfactory outcome of this investigation that will give some measure of protection to European Union producers in this sector which is very important for the poorer regions."
"I welcome the decision on satellite surveillance of fishing."
"I did a report on it myself some years ago."
"At that time the idea of the spy-in-the-sky was an emotive issue."
"It was being used against the European Union, cited as an effort to invade everybody's privacy."
"This is absolute nonsense."
"It is only reasonable that the Community should adopt modern technology which will keep pace with what is happening in other sectors."
"If the boats get faster and if the nets get bigger and more powerful, it is only natural that we should use all the modern technology available to us."
"There is a positive side to this, namely safety."
"Many boats have been lost at sea in years past and if they had had this facility on board lives could have been saved."
"We are glad that the excessive administrative costs have not been applied to inshore fishermen but, nevertheless, we welcome what has been done so far."
"So far as fleet reductions are concerned, there is one thing I have to say."
"It seems always to be bad news."
"The fishing industry is always being told to make reductions."
"It never seems to be explained that there is a long-term objective which can bring profits."
"I saw a report at one time which said that we could increase the catch from European waters by 50 % if we would apply the conservation measures necessary."
"At the end of the day what we need is a long-term programme - seven or ten years - with a bottom line that tells us what we can expect to achieve in the end and, in the meantime, the investment necessary."
"For social reasons we need to make an investment and I am glad to hear accompanying measures being spoken about."
"However, I would like to see a bottom line which can give some sort of hope to the disadvantaged regions and the fishing communities."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for her statement and I agree with almost everything she said."
"We have to remember that the MAGP policies were introduced in the beginning to balance the European Union's domestic fleets and fishing effort to the European Union waters fishing opportunities."
"Clearly, fishing fleets are too large, clearly fishing effort is too strong - so we have a big problem!"
"On the one issue I want to address I will probably be shot down, but there are some parts of the European Union flag fleet that do not contribute to that problem."
"They are not fishing in European Union waters: they fish exclusively outside European Union waters, under agreements which we have negotiated with various countries around the world, and those agreements are I hope respected and monitored."
"One example, and I make no apologies for a blatant constituency interest, is that the remains of the British distantwater fleet fish off Norway, Iceland and various other north Atlantic places."
"They fish mainly from my constituency and they are under very strict control."
"I appreciate that there are examples of this fishing exclusively outside EU waters in many other Member States."
"Is it possible that these fishing boats, which are guaranteed to fish outside Member States, should be excluded from the MAGP process altogether?"
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner, for your presence and your statement."
"I would like to start by saying that I support and value the agreement reached on TACs and quotas in the December Council."
"It seems reasonable to me and I think the objectives that have been set are balanced in terms of conservation of resources and appropriate exploitation of them."
"So after that positive assessment, I want to go beyond the actual distribution of this year's quotas and seek to evaluate the whole distribution system itself."
"From this angle, there is continuity in the Council's decision and the system employed, to the extent that it is based on the principle of relative stability, which has succeeded in fulfilling the mission of distributing resources objectively, but, as we see it, it has some important failings today."
"In the first place, there are serious problems about the system in terms of conservation of resources."
"Thus the lack of a multi-species TAC system forces some Community fleets to throw species of legal size back into the sea because they do not have a quota."
"We continue to have a rather absurd system which bans certain trawler fleets of Member States from catching a range of species brought up in the net and they have to be returned to the sea without any benefit to the stock."
"The system is logically unacceptable from the viewpoint of economic exploitation."
"And from the viewpoint of resource conservation we are deceiving ourselves because our quotas do not account for actual fish mortality."
"Moreover, the principle of relative stability clearly discriminates against some Community fleets."
"For example, the Community fleet under the Spanish flag only has access to 8 species out of the 22 for which there are quotas."
"And that is one of the reasons for the discards I just mentioned, because what are these ships going to do with the sole or cod they catch, in some cases involuntarily, when they do not have quotas for those species?"
"In addition, equilibrium under the principle of relative stability is calculated on data and periods when some fleets saw their opportunities of fishing in Community waters reduced as a result, amongst other factors, of the extension of fishing limits to 200 miles in 1976, which also changed historical access to the fishing grounds."
"Finally, a third factor casts doubt on the current validity of the principle of relative stability as a constant of the common fisheries policy: the fact that markets for fish have been completely liberalized, frontiers no longer exist in the Union for marketing fish, and yet extremely rigid national barriers are still in place in terms of access to Community resources for Community fleets."
"These points also apply when considering the necessary reform of the common fisheries policy to ensure that the distribution of quotas is not based on anachronistic criteria, regardless of what the current system is and whether the TACs and quotas should be set on the basis of it."
"This is nothing to reproach the December Council with, I evaluate it positively as I said at first, but I do expect the Commission to take up these ideas and be the dynamic factor for profound medium term reform of the common fisheries policy so that the desirable equilibrium can be achieved between responsible exploitation of resources and their conservation, with equal opportunities for all the ships that form part of what ought to be a Community fleet, that is, a European fleet."
"And I end with a small comment on the technical measures."
"The proposal for a regulation on technical measures starts, in my opinion, from the wrong hypothesis."
"It assumes that young fish are currently being caught because of the size of mesh in the nets used and we all know, Madam Commissioner, that a large part of this fishing is due to illegal activities and lack of effective control, because control is in the hands of the Member States and unfortunately they fail to enforce it."
"The paradox of tougher technical measures is that they will prejudice those who respect them and make those who continue to catch young fish in breach of the fishing regulations more competitive."
"So let us make respect for the law the priority."
"If we toughen and enforce control we will enormously reduce this serious problem of catching young fish."
"We should not just punish those who comply with the law and respect the technical measures."
"I think that would be unjust."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, may I say that I am very happy that this debate has been placed high on our agenda: this will dispel the dismal impression given in December and, I am pleased at the choice of this time-slot out of respect for you, Madam Commissioner."
"I noted three words in your statement: transparency, efficiency and balance."
"Transparency remains - as we well know - a very important factor in making progress towards an accurate evaluation of overcapacity."
"So I welcome satellite monitoring, something we have been talking about for years in Parliament."
"We know that this needed some courage, that it was unpopular."
"But we have achieved it, so much the better, even though I understand very well that we have exempted small inshore fishing fleets, which do not place the same burden on our resources."
"You then spoke of efficiency."
"And here we know that more progress will have to be made in the technical measures of selectivity and protection of juvenile fish, as I have been saying again and again for a number of years now."
"Here also, courage will be needed."
"This can all be summarized in a few very simple words."
"We must fish less - we know that - but we must also more than anything else fish better and to do this we must not only reduce capacity, but also and above all introduce some selectivity."
"Lastly, the third word, balance: the necessary balance between the resource and human activity."
"This is the whole socio-economic aspect."
"You will easily understand that this concerns us."
"You were an elected Member of this House, Madam Commissioner, and anyone elected is the spokesperson for men and women who find it hard to earn a living in our coastal regions."
"We cannot ignore these social and economic worries."
"We have to do something about this and that is why, personally, I much prefer completing the necessary reduction in fleets to reducing activity in several forms."
"I believe it would be reasonable not only to improve resource management but also to take account of the socio-economic realities of our coastal regions."
"Mr President, I want to start this speech by thanking Mrs Bonino for the great cooperation she has shown the Committee on Fisheries of the European Parliament during the two and a half years I have had the honour of chairing it."
"It has not been a time without serious problems, but in spite of all, relations between the Commission and Parliament could not have been better."
"So thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"Moving to the substance of this debate, I have to say that after the last Council of Fisheries Ministers and after listening to the Commissioner's statement, one can only feel intense frustration and uneasiness."
"Frustration at the narrow range of the decisions taken and the postponement of the most important ones, and uneasiness because, in my view, some of the decisions are inexplicable."
"Frustration because MAGP IV and the technical measures were not approved by the Council."
"The Commission's proposals were drafted without proper thought, realism or composure."
"Does the Commissioner recognize that the proposals have been formulated without carefully assessing their economic and social consequences and without setting up additional support mechanisms at the same time, which would make them easier to accept?"
"Uneasiness, Madam Commissioner, because of the approval of some TACs and quotas which, in my opinion, depart from the line maintained until a few days ago by the Commission."
"How do you explain the contradiction between some TACs being generally if slightly increased and certain guidelines which, as some colleagues have mentioned, propose drastic cuts due to the poor state of resources?"
"Something is wrong with the equation."
"Frustration because, on the one hand, the satellite monitoring plan is pretty remote from the agreements adopted by this Parliament, without prejudice to its amendments to them, and, on the other hand, so many conditions have been introduced into the final wording that the possibility of effective control of the fleets has been seriously limited."
"Uneasiness, Madam Commissioner, because the Commission's letter freezing structural aid represents a sweeping measure with the same impact on Member States which, as Mrs Fraga says, have strictly complied with the reduction objectives of the MAGP and those who have ignored them."
"There is no encouragement to exemplary behaviour if pressure is not applied selectively, especially when the aid that is frozen is covered by Community support frameworks approved by the Commission, which in principle constitutes a sufficient legal basis for granting it."
"In conclusion, Madam Commissioner, I think the outcome of the last Council is a serious setback to the process of reforming the common fisheries policy, but we trust in your well-known ability to relaunch that reform and contribute to adoption by the Council of the regulations awaiting approval as soon as possible, because that is what the state of the resources and the guarantee of a stable future for our fishermen requires, Madam Commissioner."
"Mr President, I would like to start my speech by mentioning that I disagree with what your predecessor said about the Commissioner's speaking time."
"Commissioner Bonino is known for not mincing her words."
"She never tries what I believe the French call 'langue de bois' , or as we say in Spanish, ' vender la moto' ."
"The Commissioner never fudges things."
"She always gets straight to the point."
"So the more time she has, the better for us."
"I urge the Commissioner to take no notice of those comments from the chair, because I think we very much want to listen to her."
"Having said that, the Commissioner will not mind if I criticize the Commission, specifically on its weakness regarding the biological rest period for cephalopods."
"When she negotiated the agreement at the end of 1995, she was praised for her firm stand, but now we find, as Mr Novo said earlier, that the Commission has accepted a doubling of the biological rest period, with no explanation and virtually no information, purely on the basis of a few catches by a few Community ships."
"I have received no explanation."
"I cannot explain to my fisherman what happened to make the biological rest period suddenly increase from two to four months."
"I am also concerned about what appears in the agreements adopted in the Joint Committee on the landing of fish in Moroccan ports."
"Perhaps this has to do with the application of later agreements, but we need more information to appreciate the consequences for our fishermen."
"And finally, as Mr Novo said, referring to a Moroccan statement on non-renewal of the fishing agreement with Morocco, which could have devastating consequences, I would ask the Commission what repercussions this would have on the commercial and financial concessions granted by the European Union to the Kingdom of Morocco in the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation."
"Mr President, I have heard many speakers say today that we are frustrated."
"I have heard that the Council is frustrated."
"But quite clearly, we are frustrated."
"There is not enough fish, my friends."
"That is the crux of the matter."
"That is the reason why we are gathered here."
"What we are talking about today is the conflict between the adjustment of capacity and the limiting of activity."
"Limiting activity is a very difficult issue in the context of the common fisheries policy."
"I speak from personal experience of the discussions on mesh sizes."
"You can provide compensation by increasing engine power, so that the mesh size is not so critical."
"I know a whole range of tricks, since I am perhaps one of the few people here in the House who has been a fisherman himself."
"Over the last 20 years, we have had a fleet which is so advanced that the same number of vessels can catch three times as much."
"So it is clear that we have to look at the problem from a different angle."
"I am strongly in favour of conserving stocks."
"But the two things - on the one hand adjusting activity, on the other imposing limits and conserving stocks - do not always go hand in hand."
"That is why we are obliged to adjust capacity and hence reduce the fleet."
"But this should be done jointly in all the Member States."
"It cannot be right for some people first to exhaust their own fishing grounds and then to try to exhaust those of their neighbours."
"We have to act in a consistent way."
"From a socio-economic viewpoint, I would warn against support which does not help to bring about structural change, since otherwise we shall have the same thing as in the agricultural sector, where we often provide social assistance rather than real agricultural support."
"Earlier today, we heard about the very high withdrawal prices and the quantity of fish withdrawn, which was extremely large last year."
"This is helping to protect and maintain a system which does not look towards the future."
"I put my trust in the Commissioner and support her continuing efforts, whilst joining in the praise which has already been expressed."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I just want to tackle two subjects: MAGP IV and Morocco."
"As far as MAGP IV is concerned, I am convinced that when there is a crisis such as the one facing this sector, the fishery sector, any proposals aimed at reducing fishing fleets will be seen as unpopular."
"But I recognise that, given the state of deterioration of fishing stocks it is natural that the whole balance of the process of initiating these issues begins by setting our sights very high."
"That is just what the Commission has done: the Commission has set its sights very high in terms of proposals on the basis of MAGP IV."
"I am not going to discuss the scientific reliability of the basis used, but I recognise and I concede that there had to be a scientific basis to begin with."
"But once these proposals are on the table, then we have to have a process of compromise and given that either we have to have a possibility for a compromise to be reached between the Commission and the Council or else the lack of agreement between the Commission and the Council will only be enhanced."
"On the other hand, as I already said in the Committee on Fisheries, I cannot accept that Member States which fulfil the objectives defined in MAGP III should be penalised with cuts in their fleets, in the terms which have already been referred to by my colleagues, Mr Fraga Est√©vez and Mr Miguel Arias Ca√±ete, and as I already mentioned in the Committee on Fisheries."
"In other words there is a Community support framework, there is an IFOP regulation, and there is a basic regulation: I do not see why the Commission should indulge in this kind of blackmail."
"Finally let us talk about Morocco."
"The Fisheries Agreements with Morocco will end up in the current form."
"The future will obviously see the setting up of joint ventures."
"But I would like to ask - and I really must insist quite clearly on this to the Commissioner - is whether there really is a will on the Commission's part to involve Member States in particular Spain and Portugal in the preparation already or after 1999, or otherwise all we are doing is postponing the problem?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I exceeded my speaking time at the beginning, at least I made up for the time we did not have in December to prepare the Council's dossiers."
"Our debate is therefore the dual outcome of the Council's work and the dossiers you have voted for."
"However, the breadth and depth of the debate just held, and even the number of contributors, obliges me to group my replies under several headings mentioned by many of you and to deal with each of them at the same time."
"Forgive me if I forget anybody, but I did try to take as many notes as possible."
"First of all, let us talk about current events."
"I shall look first at Morocco."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you must remember that the clause of agreement with Morocco included a provision that, apart from the two months of biological dormancy, and I refer here to cephalopods, any other conservation measure could be jointly agreed between the two parties."
"Starting in November the Moroccan authorities and sector have informed us of their concerns about the resources plan."
"After quite long negotiations, we have reached a joint decision to add March and April to the 'cephalopod' biological dormancy period for all ships of all flags in all areas, thus giving the species a period during which it can recover."
"I think this is quite clear in the final statement from the Joint Commission, so there is no discrimination."
"It will obviously be necessary to monitor this, but I would like to point out that this was a planned measure which was jointly agreed."
"I can assure you that it is not the normal custom of the Commission to be subjected to pressure, particularly when there are illegal ship inspections."
"Attempts can always be made to exert pressure - we need to know if others are subjected to it."
"As regards the renewal of the agreement, I think it is impossible to impose anything on a sovereign third country."
"This is a case where a little momentum needs to be imparted."
"I think, for example, that the partnership meeting about fisheries, which will take place in May in Casablanca, is one step further in the Commission's activities, so that relations with Morocco, including commercial ones, become increasingly partnership relations and are less strained so that, apart from the problems of political flourishes by one side or the other - and you are political enough to know what political flourishes are - we can reach a calmer, renegotiable position."
"I can guarantee nothing, but this is the line and these are the activities that the Commission is pursuing."
"I now pass on to other matters that have been mentioned, and I return to the TACs and quotas."
"Mr Teverson, I fully share your view."
"Moreover, the Commission proposed more than two years ago that a general political debate on TACs and quotas be initiated but that, subsequently, over the details, this type of night-time negotiation is better conducted at the level of technical management so that the dossier does not remain at a high political level with everybody then being able to claim a victory, almost like a Napoleonic night."
"I also think it would be a good thing if we all committed ourselves to making the TAC and quota issues less dramatic and less exposed to media attention. Because that is not the main issue."
"The subject is very popular with the media and is given great media coverage."
"We negotiate all night, we sometimes exchange fish that are not there and in the end everybody has won."
"I do not know what has been won, but everybody claims victory!"
"I mentioned political flourishes just now."
"These do not occur only in third countries, and you understand that as well as I do."
"But if we can, together, do more to reduce the drama and even reduce media coverage of the subject, while making it clear that the real issue of the common fisheries policy is in fact to be found elsewhere, that could help us."
"That leads me to say something about the future and the way I intend to deal with the debate on the common fisheries policy."
"I now intend to set up a kind of task force within DG XIV, not linked to day-to-day management of the fisheries policy but starting from now, that is from 1997, committed without prejudice and taboos to a new general review taking us to 2002."
"I also think it would be a good idea to begin consultations with the parliamentary sectors concerned, so as to give ourselves plenty of time, and to do this it would be a good thing to have a small task force devoting all its time to this work without having to deal with day-to-day management as well."
"Although Mr Nicholson is no longer here, I am sure that he will read over the minutes of this debate and I wish to say to him 'That's obvious' ."
"After all, the Commission along with Parliament and the Fisheries Committee chairman, Mr Arias Ca√±ete, have organized many seminars and debates between the parliamentary sectors, in which many of you have taken part."
"It is obvious that neither the chairman nor the Commission can force people to participate, but facilities were provided and the choice was there, and I hope more and more that these opportunities for open debate, almost off the record, will be increasingly accepted."
"I return to MAGP-IV just to give some more details."
"In suspending aid to the fishing fleet - not all the aid to the fisheries sector - there is no blackmail."
"It is automatically a legal result of a shortfall in a MAGP, so there is no blackmail."
"I hope, on the contrary, that this can help those among us who consider it necessary to have a MAGP to urge those who do not like it to accept their decisions."
"I should point out, as is clearly specified in the agreement, that if a MAGP should be concluded by April aid to the fleets will obviously be restored retrospectively."
"If a decision is reached, nothing will be lost since the aid would be restored, but suspension of aid to the fleet is automatic if there is no restructuring plan."
"Much has been said about the general lines of the MAGP."
"I do not want to go over these again."
"Mr Crampton, I am not convinced by your proposal to withdraw MAGP-IV altogether from the distant water fleets which fish in waters of third countries."
"Perhaps you made this proposal to provoke us, to make us think about it, but may I say that stocks are at risk not only in our waters, but world-wide and even in the waters of third countries."
"We must take care not to find ourselves in a difficult position."
"So I take note of your idea but I do not think it is viable at the moment."
"Mr Baldarelli asked me what the position is regarding MAGP-III."
"I think it is an important prerequisite."
"MAGP-III, which ended on 31 December, will be evaluated in April according to the rules, so as to be based on data from member countries."
"So if you can help us in getting member countries to send their data quickly and in similar formats, it would enable us to clarify our ideas considerably."
"Another word in reply to a group of Members of Parliament, particularly Mr McCartney, Mr McMahon and Mr McCartin, who raised the problem of salmon."
"Let me first say again that we must not forget that the most efficient producers of salmon record an increase in productivity of between 5 and 6 %. It is clear that prices fall when more salmon is produced and when there is an increase in productivity of 5 to 6 %."
"The consequences of this are obvious."
"An additional factor is that, fairly predictably, the price is once again falling after the Christmas festivities."
"We shall see in the next few weeks what happens, but you also know that the minimum price has not been a very efficient measure."
"It was more of a political signal."
"Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the real solution to the problem lies in the results of the Committee of Inquiry on measures to combat dumping."
"Thus, I would like us to work together to find lasting solutions, even if it means urgently examining what is happening."
"I hope I have more or less grouped the replies to the questions put to me."
"If I have forgotten anybody, I will send them a reply in writing."
"Thank you Mr President, thank you ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Arias Ca√±ete."
"I think another of your colleagues will be taking over the presidency, but I am pleased with the way we have collaborated, and the way you have collaborated with the Commission."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"Community forestry strategy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0414/96) by Mr Thomas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on a global Community strategy for the forestry sector."
"Mr President, I have great pleasure in presenting today my report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the European Union's forestry strategy."
"I would first like to point out the procedural significance of this report which constitutes an important historical step for the European Parliament."
"Article 138b of the Treaty on European Union gives Parliament the right to initiate legislation."
"Although this article has indeed been used before for specific measures, this is the first occasion on which it is being used to call for legislation across the entire sector, which is of considerable importance in all Member States and has implications which touch on the employment, economic prospects and future of millions of citizens of the Union."
"I am proud to be associated with this step and I shall be very interested to hear from the Commissioner, who is here today, whether the Commission intends to respond positively to this request by Parliament."
"Forestry is extremely important in the European Union although, of course, its importance varies in different Member States."
"When I was in Finland recently, a forest owner said to me that, for Finland, the forestry industry was as important as the automobile industry is in Germany."
"The resolution which the Committee on Agriculture voted for unanimously covers the following points: it stresses the importance of the forestry sector as a source of employment and wealth and points out that the commercial utilization of forests should be a priority."
"However, one has to recognize the diversity of European forests; their multi-functional nature and the need for ecological, economic and social sustainability."
"This means that forestry strategy must be based on the principle of subsidiarity."
"We have to aim for a clear definition of national policies, setting objectives at national and international level and establishing a link between forest strategy and other policies such as environmental and rural policy."
"Quite clearly the European Union and its Member States must respect the resolutions approved under the Rio Declaration and the Helsinki Agreement."
"The resolution concentrates on three different aspects: the protection of forests, their utilization and development, and their extension."
"As far as protection is concerned, I would like to highlight one important point: the protection of forests against fire."
"Every year approximately half-a-million hectares of forest are destroyed by fire."
"This is a massive waste of resources which should be tackled by a coordinated programme at Member State, regional and forest-owner level and by action by the European Union."
"We need to encourage the utilization of forests not just as a source of timber, but for their environmental and recreational values."
"These are not mutually exclusive areas of concern."
"There is no reason why the use of timber should not be encouraged, particularly through a coherent quality policy, while at the same time, forests should become an even more valuable resource as a means of recreation for our citizens and because of their environmental value."
"We also need to extend and increase forest resources, respecting biodiversity and the traditional landscape and helping to prevent erosion and desertification."
"In some parts of the EU it makes sense to promote the sustainable management of agri-forestry systems."
"There is also specific action we should take to improve the European forestry inventory, encourage research in forest eco-systems, develop education and training and promote the development of economic and social interests of forests."
"The committee is also making proposals to extend the role of the Permanent Forestry Committee so that it becomes the chief instrument in the coordination of forestry matters and, at international level, to coordinate forestry-related concepts more effectively so that they are taken into account in the Union's general trade policies."
"The Commission should submit an effective action plan to combat ecological and social dumping in relation to imports of timber."
"Also, the Commission and the Member States should continue to work actively towards an international convention on the protection and sustainability of forest management."
"There is also the difficult question of how to agree an international certification system concerning the sustainable management of forests."
"Certification should meet the objectives of enhancing - economically, socially and ecologically - the sustainable use of forests."
"I hope that I have covered the main aspects of the committee's proposals."
"The committee voted for this report unanimously and I hope that it will receive a large measure of support in Parliament in order to ensure that our voice is heard loud and clear in the Commission."
"I would like to hear whether the Commissioner will be making a proposal along the lines suggested."
"With regard to the amendments which have been tabled, I would like to remind Members that my priority is to see that a large measure of consensus which was achieved in the Agriculture Committee is preserved."
"I am not prepared to accept amendments which upset this balance."
"I am, however, accepting some ideas from Members which are useful additions."
"I emphasize that - useful additions."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur, David Thomas, who has, in my view, worked long and very effectively on a very important report which gives the view of this House on a sector crucial to the future of the European Union."
"When we use Parliament's legislative initiative, we should do so on very important and special occasions, and there is no doubt that the issue we are today dealing with is one of them."
"We are asking the Commission to submit, on the basis of the articles of the Treaty and within two years, a legislative proposal on a forestry strategy for Europe, recognizing the environmental and ecological role of Europe's forests, in terms of biodiversity and the part they have to play in preventing erosion and desertification and as the most important source of renewable energy Europe has available to it."
"And we similarly refer to the economic, silvicultural and commercial use of forests, taking account of the diversity and multi-functional nature of forests and the very different experiences which - particularly in the wake of the enlargement of the European Union - we are now seeing within the Union."
"I think that the report is structured around three critical issues: the protection, use and development of forests and their enhancement."
"I firmly believe that all three of those elements can play a full part in the new policy for rural development which, following the Cork Conference organized by the Commission, has opened up a wide-ranging debate on the whole of the common agricultural policy."
"There were those who described the arguments of Commissioner Fischler at the Cork Conference as a flight of fancy, an utopian view of the future."
"But I firmly believe that we have only to think of an issue such as that of the forests to realize that this is not utopian but real and offers a wealth of possibilities."
"There is no doubt that we could perhaps have gone further still here in the European Parliament: in the discussions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, some argued that it was appropriate to talk in terms of a genuine common policy for forests."
"I do not myself think it realistic, at present, to think in terms of a common policy for forests with all the trappings of, for example, more traditional common policies such as the CAP."
"What we need to do is devise a strategy which properly applies subsidiarity: subsidiarity used not as an excuse for doing nothing but as an opportunity for doing things in a more intelligent and targeted way."
"And so, the real issue is not to spend more but to improve coordination of the resources that already exist and those measures in place at national and European level - and, fortunately, there are many of them - designed to make proper use of the forestry heritage of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. We quite rightly recognise that the report before us on a common forestry strategy had a difficult struggle to see the light of day."
"And why was that so?"
"Allow me to try to offer a constructive explanation."
"For many countries forestry represents a vital economic and cultural foundation."
"The forestry sector is also undoubtedly one with a future."
"Forests and wooded areas cover 41.5 % of the surface area of the European Union, divided over more than 10 million owners, and 2.8 million people are either directly or indirectly dependent on the forestry sector."
"And so it is easy to understand why forests arouse so much passion in the debate."
"The result is here for all to see."
"That is why I would like to express my warmest thanks to all who have cooperated in producing this acceptable compromise."
"I think that this is expressed in the unanimous decision in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Let me draw attention to another positive aspect."
"Parliament took the initiative in this case."
"It is only through this kind of undertaking, I think, that we shall strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the early stages of the debate."
"We as Members of this House should ever bear that in mind."
"Some points in this report merit particular attention in my view, particular from the Austrian angle, which is of course very close to my own."
"Austria has 3.87 million hectares of wooded area of which 86 % is managed."
"Some 250, 000 persons depend either directly or indirectly on the forestry sector or work in it."
"The main roles of forests is defined as their economic utilisation and their value in environmental and leisure terms."
"I think it important that these roles are seen as a whole."
"I think it would be a mistake to equate economic utilisation with exploiting natural resources."
"Only planned and particularly sustainable management can guarantee the ecological balance of forests in the long term."
"And to ensure this economic balance in the forests we must have responsible hunting."
"Forest management is of prime importance for mountain areas in particular, which are well known to suffer from neglect in other agriculture management."
"Wood has become a basic element as a raw material, a work material and also as a source of energy."
"An increase in the use of biomass, as we hope for, will certainly lead to a greater demand for wood."
"There is no need for me to dwell on the many other varied uses of wood."
"But one thing is clear: wood, as a renewable raw material, is a product which we must value more."
"The question immediately arises of expanding forestry resources."
"And here we must make a clear distinction between those areas where afforestation is sensible or necessary and those where it should only be considered as a last resort to manage rural areas."
"It goes without saying that we should reforest in order to prevent erosion or protect woods."
"But caution is needed in areas where natural landscapes would be altered."
"Our guiding principle should continue to be, not afforestation, but the preservation of wooded areas."
"We all know that throughout the EU, with the exception of Greece, forest expansion is greater than depletion."
"I think that the report takes proper account of fire protection, use of pesticides and the biological resources of the forests."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will vote in favour of this compromise for a common forestry strategy in the EU."
"Mr President, it is not easy to venture into the issue of Europe's forests without running the risk of getting hopelessly lost."
"Congratulations are therefore first due to the rapporteur who, following exhausting efforts to reach a compromise through a tangle of amendments, managed to emerge with a number of basic proposals on which we shall be able to work in the future."
"This was a difficult report because there are many aspects to this issue, just as the forests of Europe are many and varied in nature: they range from the birch forest of Finland to the eucalyptus forest of Portugal and the palms of the Canaries."
"There are therefore general principles that have to be taken into account, such as, for instance, the first paragraph of Section A, which refers to management, which needs to be applied to the lowest level. This means applying the principle of subsidiarity in the action taken, going so far as to assign direct personal responsibility to the landowner for protecting and using his forestry resources."
"In the second paragraph of that same Section (A), there is, however, a contradiction, since general criteria for use of forests are proposed, whereas differing criteria are needed."
"The forests of central and northern Europe cannot be used in the same way as the Alpine forests, nor as the Mediterranean maquis, with the presence of man resulting not only in the use of forests to obtain wood but in tourism and recreational activity, triggering different problems, beginning with hydrogeological protection of the land."
"One principle that has to be established concerns the property rights of those who own forest, but also the right of local people to intervene in instances where, either because of a lack of resources or because of a failure to cultivate them properly, neglect results in damage to forests."
"In cases of that kind, it is appropriate to earmark specific aid for that purpose."
"All forms of coordination and association between owners have also to be encouraged, as is stated in paragraph 12 which refers to increasing forest resources."
"It is right to encourage owners to exchange information and discuss their experiences as well as to promote forms of training and advice for forest managers and workers and, above all, farmers who have day-to-day experience of what is happening in the forests and should become their indirect controllers and custodians."
"The Standing Forestry Committee has a crucial role to play here: we need to place our faith in it and it needs to be organized as a real task force that is dynamic and able to take a broad range of action."
"If we are to do this, we have to be resolute in tackling the last chapter of the report which discusses the issue of funding."
"We need to undertake a serious study of the means of action based on a clear system of priorities: first, to safeguard forests and genetic resources; secondly, there has to be a European forestry register, diversified criteria for use, clear rules, technical assessment and protection from dangers."
"The lesson is that the forests cannot become either a resource for the wood industry or a natural park from which man is completely excluded: man has to become both the promoter and user of forests but, above all, shoulder responsibility for the survival of forests."
"The debate will now be suspended, to resume at 3 p.m."
"We now proceed to the votes."
"Statement by the President"
"Before we start the voting, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the satisfaction of the European Parliament at the signing of the Hebron Agreement by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Head of the Israeli Government, and Mr Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Council."
"This Agreement, approved by the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Council, is an important step towards peace and restores hope that the Oslo process will be initiated again, as called for repeatedly by the European Parliament."
"I think we can congratulate ourselves because, at least according to the agency news, the intervention of the European Union, through the appointed mediator, contributed to a successful outcome to these discussions."
"I think I speak for all of you when I say that."
"(Applause)"
"Votes"
"Mr President, my group considers the time allocated to us on Monday for this important motion for a resolution is too short."
"That is why we shall abstain in the vote, but it does not mean that we do not approve of this resolution and the gist of its content."
"Thank you very much, Mr H√§nsch."
"May I suggest that perhaps the most appropriate course would have been an explanation after the vote rather than a point of order, as you know."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mrs Jackson, during voting in this House it is customary for group officers covering the report in question - and therefore a maximum of one person per group - to be seated beside the person who is taking the decision on behalf of the group."
"So unless there is a change in the Rules of Procedure - which do not say anything on this - I think this practice should be maintained to facilitate the progress of the votes for the benefit of all."
"Other people should not be here, of course."
"Mr President, the Dublin summit has, we are told, won a major victory: agreement on the main elements of the stability pact which should bind participating countries to the single currency."
"But when we look more closely at it, this great victory appears very dubious."
"Let us read the final communiqu√© from the European Council."
"After expressing satisfaction about the so-called agreement, it sends the implementing texts back to the Ecofin Council not to be signed but, I quote, ' to be carefully examined' , which means in plain language that the European Council has serious misgivings about certain points."
"Moreover, it invites Finance Ministers to prepare for the Amsterdam Council, and therefore in June 1997, a draft resolution which, again I quote, ' will record the commitment of Member States, the Commission and the Council to apply the stability agreement rigorously' ."
"By dissecting the communiqu√©, we thus discover that behind the grand declarations there was in reality no commitment, no signature to an overall commitment."
"There were two reasons for that."
"First, since the stability pact was not explicitly provided for in the Maastricht Treaty, lawyers are experiencing great difficulties in including such an ambitious construction in the existing rather sketchy provisions."
"If they do not succeed in this, which seems likely to me, it will be necessary to go back to the various nations to modify the Treaty and perhaps even to alter constitutions, particularly in Germany and France."
"In addition, there has not yet been any decision over the two opposing concepts of the stability pact."
"Is it to be a simple agreement for the proper functioning of the single currency between countries quite close to each other, or will it be aiming at forced convergence between very different countries not forming a truly optimum monetary zone?"
"In other words, what would be better: a Europe divided into two or a Europe subjected to a compulsory bureaucratic convergence?"
"This is the dilemma into which the single currency has locked us today."
"We cannot vote for the resolution as, in many respects, it goes against our own and, above all, our voter's views of the future structure of the EU."
"We do not believe that the introduction of the EMU will promote growth or employment."
"Nor do we think it desirable that the EU should take on increased powers in Foreign or Security policy."
"We believe that each and every one of the EU Member States should have a free and independent vote in international cooperation."
"The most important task for the EU at the moment is to bring about enlargement to the East."
"The problems with EU agricultural and regional policies must be resolved as soon as possible so that we can accommodate the new Member States."
"Much has already been written on (and about) the Irish presidency, its high standard, the Dublin summit, its positive results for the euro, but there is not much about institutions... not to mention unemployment."
"I will not return to this in detail other than to congratulate the Irish government and to encourage the Dutch presidency which is now beginning."
"While noting in my turn the oddities of history which, after closely linking the Netherlands with the Maastricht Treaty, now once again makes the same country responsible for a fundamental monetary and institutional phase of the Treaty, I wish today to pay tribute to the quality of the work done by small countries in the European entente."
"Although I am personally in favour of an institutional reform that would question the six-monthly change of presidency, which does not allow long enough to govern properly (what would we say today about a country that changed its government every six months?), that does not mean that new and longer presidencies would necessarily suit the big countries."
"The experience of the last few years, including that of Ireland whom I congratulate once again, shows the commitment and the dependability of the European work carried out by smaller countries compared with that of larger ones... who very often 'still believe themselves to be at the centre of the world' when they do not still think of themselves as 'great powers' ..."
"There are of course exceptions... but as a Frenchman I know what I am talking about."
"We have a whole series of objections to the motion for a resolution before us, particularly with reference to the passages on the WTO Conference."
"The WTO Conference in Singapore was not a 'complete success' , as the Commission continually claims in its official reports."
"The Commission justifies its claim that it was a 'huge international success' (to quote Sir Leon Brittan in his final press statement of 13.12 1996) by constantly citing the agreement in the sphere of information technologies (OTA), the progress in negotiations on telecommunications and the understanding within part of the quad group on customs reductions for spirits and other alcoholic beverages."
"Apart from the fact that the latter is only indirectly to do with the WTO Conference, and apart from the questionable consequences on public health of price cuts for whisky, rum, cognac or gin, I wonder whether the progress in negotiations in the fields of information technologies and telecommunications will really be advantageous to the citizens of Europe, to European consumers."
"It is more than doubtful whether it will lead to further substantial price reductions for computer software and the like."
"It is precisely in my capacity as Parliament's rapporteur on 'Trade and the Environment' that I must unfortunately conclude that the Singapore Conference was an unadulterated failure."
"Parliament's decisions prior to the WTO Conference were completely ignored; hardly any part of our demands are to be found in the final declaration."
"Singapore has not brought any progress at all for the environment!"
"I agree with Mr Carlos Pimenta that the Conference was a failure and the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment (CTE) has failed."
"The CTE has proved itself incapable of coming to any kind of concrete results in the two years of its work."
"Despite its failure - or perhaps we might suspect precisely because of it - to secure environmental protection in world trade, the CTE has had its mandate renewed for a further two years."
"On 'Social Standards' Singapore was also a flop."
"Here too no institutional advance was made."
"Sir Leon is not exactly famous for his affection for trade union matters, but here the problem lies first and foremost with the Council."
"The governments in London and Bonn in particular acted disgracefully as a brake before the conference, and when you hear what the German Economics Minister, Mr Rexrodt, said in Singapore then you know that so long as such people are in the national governments then there will not be the slightest bit of social progress in world trade."
"It is shameful that the EU did not protest more strongly when the Director General of the ILO, Michel Hansenne, had his invitation to speak at the WTO Conference withdrawn, under pressure from some countries."
"The WTO Conference also failed in matters of transparency and NGO participation."
"Demonstrations were banned in Singapore during the WTO Conference."
"There were no official channels for NGOs to make their concerns and expertise known to the negotiating delegations."
"Important meetings took place in the most intimate composition, even ministers from some third world countries were denied access to these meeting rooms."
"The NGOs protested strongly in Singapore against the obstacles to their work and thrust a protest declaration into Sir Leon's hand."
"When you hear him speak now you are convinced that he never read it."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Eriksson, Sepp√§nen, Sj√∂stedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm, Lindholm and Sch√∂rling (V), Bonde, Lis Jensen, Krarup and Sandbaek (I-EDN), in writing."
"(SV) In contrast to the majority in Parliament, we think that the Irish presidency's draft framework for an amendment of the Treaty is a move in totally the wrong direction."
"Although important institutional issues - including the scope of majority decisions, the rules of flexibility, changes in the weighting of votes in the Council, the role of the Commission and its composition - have still not been clarified in any detail, the aims of the Irish presidency are quite clear."
"The aim is for more supranational decisions and a strengthening of the EU's federal operating bodies at the expense of the Member States."
"This will lead to a considerable loss of democracy."
"For the foreseeable future, it is activity at national level which will guarantee the democratic legitimacy which our people find acceptable."
"The strong bias in the draft framework towards supranationality in Foreign and Defence policy and the proposal to transfer important parts of the cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs to the First Pillar is also ill thought out."
"This weakens and in some instances neutralises interparliamentary and interstate cooperation."
"As Scandinavian opponents to the Union we can also state that the 'core issues' from the Scandinavian countries, openness and the environment have so far met with minimal success."
"We are also disappointed in the weak nature of the Inter Governmental Conference which has not dared to make the link between employment issues and the unemployment creating effects of the EMU project."
"The seemingly bitter criticism of the Inter Governmental Conference put forward in the resolution principally expresses a desperate need on the side of the European Parliament to appropriate greater power for their own purpose and to increase the demand for a central superpower in Europe."
"We have, it seems, many valid reasons for rejecting the resolution."
"An important event during the Irish presidency was the first WTO Ministerial Conference held in Singapore in December."
"Although expectations were not all that high prior to the start of this conference, the outcome may be deemed surprising."
"It is after all quite something to get 128 countries backing one declaration."
"The main result of Singapore is perhaps that it strengthened the position of the WTO."
"A stable and effective multilateral trading system is of great importance for settling trade disputes and placing international trade within a framework of social and ecological rules."
"Although no great progress was made in Singapore on the liberalization of trade, it is clear that the benefits of free world trade will grow in the next few decades."
"The agreement to abolish the tariffs on trade in information technology products in the year 2000 is an important step."
"Trade in information technology involving computers, telecommunications and electronic goods is one of the fastest growing sectors of the world market."
"But less ambitious results were achieved in the area of government procurement and trade in services and liberalization here will be more difficult."
"It is less sure that the outcome of the Singapore conference will bring as much advantage to the developing world."
"Fortunately a clash between rich and poor nations was avoided by the decision that the ILO is the only organization in which the question of social standards can be dealt with and that trade measures are not the right way to impose these standards."
"As far as the very poorest countries are concerned, we wish that the Dutch proposal to abolish trade tariffs for these countries had been accepted."
"Regrettably the idea of proposing an action plan for the least developed countries, which would also include this measure, is a very informal one."
"Because countries are free to act on the proposal or not, as they wish."
"It is regrettable that there was no discussion in Singapore of trade and environment and the final communiqu√© contains no clear agreement about the relationship between the two."
"Rules to protect the environment must be adopted in the WTO on the basis of consensus."
"The WTO Committee on Trade and Environment will need to make clear recommendations on this in the near future."
"Otherwise it is very likely that the inclusion of environment policy in the WTO will be put on the back burner."
"To sum up: it is good that the Singapore conference strengthened the authority of the WTO."
"A lot more will have to be done at WTO level to combine policy on the environment, social standards and development policy to further liberalization."
"So we were happy to endorse the paragraphs of the joint motion for a resolution concerning the outcome of the Singapore conference."
"I should like in this House to quote Paul Billings, chairman of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, who said in December at the meeting of the 'European Network of the Unemployed' in Ennis:"
"'Europe's unemployed argued against the Maastricht Treaty because it failed to present any commitment to tackle the plight of the jobless."
"Since Maastricht, unemployment has soared throughout the EU."
"We have witnessed a massive widening of the gap between rich and poor."
"And now, as Governments attempt to meet the Convergence Criteria for monetary union, welfare and social budgets are being slashed."
"Europe's unemployed are no longer prepared to be sacrificed in the name of a more 'advanced union' ."
"We are demanding that full employment be made the central goal of the new Treaty."
"The Irish Government, during its presidency of the EU, is in a prime position to ensure that this demand is acted upon."
"Without such a commitment, Europe will continue to sustain unacceptable levels of unemployment, leading to rising problems of crime, drug abuse, poor health, racism and social disorder."
"We know that countries which achieve low levels of unemployment have two things in common: a widespread commitment to full employment and institutions to put this commitment into practice.'"
"I should, however, like to add another, more specific consideration, coming from a colleague in one of the big groups who did not dare to speak his mind here."
"(DE) Flexibility has been planned as a fall back position of the currency position."
"Flexibility, however, should not be allowed to become one of the principles of integration."
"At the most it may remain an exception."
"It may only solve some transitional problems which are limited in both time and content."
"And at the same time it must contain aid for Member States willing but not yet able to participate."
"It must enable these countries to participate."
"(EN) This man is also quite right."
"It makes me doubtful about our internal workings that this colleague has found it necessary to use this channel of communication for his dissent.- Revision of the Treaties (B4-0040/97)"
"We are totally opposed to the idea of increased use of the qualified majority voting for Third Pillar matters."
"This and the proposed operational capacity of Europol is not the cooperation between free states which we joined on January 1st 1995."
"We do not think that transferring these matters to supranational level will lead to any increase in efficiency."
"We consider that every Member State must retain their right of veto in matters of Common Foreign and Security policy, CFSP."
"This is why we cannot vote for the resolution on this issue."
"Integration of the Western European Union into the EU goes against Sweden's policy of neutrality and cannot be accepted."
"Sweden, together with other neutral countries are not members of the WEU which must make integration of these two independent organisations impossible in practice."
"Our fundamental view that the EU is a cooperation between free states stands in sharp contrast to this resolution making it impossible for us to vote in favour of it."
"Oomen-Ruijten report (A4-0009/97)"
"I am very glad that common sense has prevailed on this directive."
"I was instrumental in seeking amendments to it in Parliament and I am glad to see that the spirit of these is reflected in the final text."
"I hope that Parliament will support it without amendment."
"In my view it gives the European consumer effective protection without at the same time introducing conditions on distance sales which would be so onerous that consumers would find it difficult to make purchases at a distance."
"In particular, I welcome the fact that the directive's provisions on prior information and cancellation rights will not apply to the booking of taxis, hotels, theatre tickets etc. If the rules of the directive had applied here, it would have brought the European Union into disrepute and ridicule, without benefiting consumers."
"Similarly, I am glad that the directive has been amended to enable flower delivery services such as by Interflora and other gift delivery services to continue to provide a same-day service."
"I do not regret that the directive does not deal with financial services."
"It would have been hopelessly complicated to try to tack financial services on to a directive which was not originally aimed at them."
"Certainly there remains a lot to do to ensure that European consumers do have effective protection (other than their own common sense) in terms of financial services purchased at a distance, and I am glad that the Commission is now examining this matter."
"Roth-Behrendt report (A4-0006/97)"
"We Swedish Social Democrats wish to express our doubts on the compromise proposal under consideration."
"It is obvious to us that consumers should be able to make their own choice based on a well established system of labelling."
"Use of the system proposed in this compromise would not enable the consumer to make a conscious choice."
"The fact that novel food will only be labelled if it differs from natural food in a way which can be scientifically proven minimises the responsibility of the producer."
"We consider it to be wrong to place full responsibility on European institutions instead."
"The system will lead to the spread of approved genetically modified foodstuffs which are not labelled."
"The system ought to be based on the principle of caution, which means that new products should not be permitted if they constitute a risk."
"If there is to be no comprehensive labelling system either, we feel that the consumer will be left without any real influence over his own consumption of genetically modified food."
"Despite our reservations, we are voting in favour of the compromise because the alternative is to continue with an unregulated market."
"This would be even more serious from the consumer's point of view."
"After a long process due to the disagreement between the European Parliament and the Commission and Council, which required the convening of a Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament has approved the proposal relating to novel foods and novel food ingredients."
"Novel foods (which are no longer equivalent to existing products) and 'genetically modified' foods must be 'labelled' to provide consumers in the European Union with as detailed information as possible."
"This new Regulation is needed to face up to the globalization of the economy: Member States must avail themselves of the same regulations on labelling so that no confusion can arise over products coming particularly from the USA where genetic engineering in the food industry is already well advanced."
"This compulsory European Regulation for marketing novel foods and food ingredients is very positive."
"It provides better safety as regards genetically modified foods."
"The BEUC (the European Bureau of Consumers' Unions) has congratulated the European Parliament, which has been much more demanding about labelling than the Council, and I wish in my turn to thank and congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her work."
"The BEUC also approves the 'obligation for the Commission to monitor the impact of the regulation on the health, protection and information of consumers' ."
"However, the regulation must be supplemented by an obligation to label genetically modified seeds and raw materials."
"Once again, the European Parliament has demonstrated the value of its contribution to the introduction of first-class European legislation."
"We are voting against the Conciliation Committee's joint draft of the European Parliament and Council Regulation on novel food and food ingredients."
"The joint draft has serious shortcomings with regard to the labelling of products from genetically modified soya, maize and sugar beet and of food additives produced with the help of genetically modified organisms."
"The draft does not require labelling of these foodstuffs."
"We consider that consumers have an inviolable right to know and be able to take responsibility for what they are eating, particularly as the long term effects of genetically modified foodstuffs are difficult to predict."
"The Standing Committee on Food which will assist the Commission in the decision on novel food does not have the necessary expertise to be able to evaluate the ecological risks which can result from the unrestricted release of novel food onto the market."
"What is more, there is to be no transparency in the decision making process nor will there be participation by consumer or environmental organisations."
"The rapporteur stated that the resolution is better than being completely without legal regulations in this area."
"Of course we want clear rules but they must be based on human and environmental needs to a greater extent than this proposal allows, which is why we are voting against the joint draft."
"I am going to vote for the result from the Conciliation Committee on novel foods."
"I shall vote in favour of this Directive since genetically modified foods will then carry a distinctive label in future."
"The great majority of the press and consumers' associations have also described the result obtained by the European Parliament at the Conciliation Committee as a great success!"
"In this matter, I am against the Greenpeace campaign which, far from responding to the detailed arguments I put forward at the same time as the Group of the Party of European Socialists, continues to describe the compromise obtained by the European Parliament as insufficient."
"The arguments of Greenpeace turn out to be partly mistaken and do not take into account the interests of European consumers."
"For this reason, I have sent to Greenpeace and all the media a precise and detailed five-page reply to the arguments put forward by the environmental organization."
"Thus, it is claimed that 'the compromise on novel foods constitutes an obstacle to any stronger national legislation' ."
"Now, this objection completely ignores the fact that, within the European internal market, the principle of freedom of movement guarantees the free marketing of products."
"No national legislation (even if it should exist in the fifteen Member States, which is unlikely), can be any better than an EU Regulation based on this compromise."
"In general, Luxembourg socialists, who are sympathetic to the position taken by Greenpeace, sincerely believe that it is best to work towards a legal situation to protect consumers by voting for the compromise, when its rejection would create a legal vacuum both at European level and in some Member States, which would be harmful to the health and safety of consumers."
"Of course, the compromise is not perfect."
"But it is better to start creating a Regulation, even if it means perfecting it later on, than to reject it and having to start all over again from scratch!"
"Thus, contrary to what Greenpeace claims, we are not going against the wishes of consumers in Luxembourg nor against the resolution passed in December against genetically modified soya."
"On the contrary, we are fully aware of our responsibility to protect the health of consumers."
"The compromise reached by Parliament and Council sets the seal on a more than six-year long legislative process with a very chequered path, one which was followed closely and contentiously by consumer organisations, the public and the press."
"In the light of political and social circumstances the resulting compromise is a good one."
"The food industry in particular needs this regulation, not so much for practical, scientifically documented reasons as for political reasons."
"It needs a secure legal foundation in the debate with politicians, administrations, consumers and the public."
"If the European regulation were to fail then there would be a risk of re-nationalisation with serious restrictions on competition for the food industry."
"The only genuinely genetically modified foodstuff ready for marketing is still the 'FlavrSavr Tomato' (USA)."
"A tomato puree from a similar tomato correspondingly labelled was successfully introduced into Britain this spring."
"Genetic engineering is playing an increasing role in agricultural useful plants, albeit principally through changes to the agronomic qualities more than changes to the products themselves."
"With the genetically modified soya seeds used this year in the USA for food production we have seen the first genetically modified plant raw goods arrive in Europe."
"Some 40 further genetically modified plants will follow in the coming years."
"Almost 1, 000 outdoor experiments are being carried out with corn varieties alone; genetically modified corn was admitted in December in the EU."
"But genetic engineering has not just now begun in the production of foodstuffs with the introduction of the new soya bean, but it has been here for some time, albeit without influencing the products themselves."
"The most important areas of application of genetic engineering as far as foodstuffs are concerned are to be found in plant breeding."
"Allergens have already been successfully removed from rice and they are working on more nutritious ingredients such as the fatty acid content and on ingredients more suited to processing, such as starch composition."
"More and more encouraging results are to be expected in these fields."
"There are already potato and rapeseed varieties which have been altered in their composition; they are nearly ready to be marketed in Europe."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt writes in her report that there is no doubt that the novel foods open up a series of interesting perspectives. Yet consumers are still worried that they could even pose a hazard to human health and the environment."
"And that is precisely why I think the adoption of this regulation is very important as it regulates both the authorization and the labelling of new kinds of foods."
"It does strike me as a pharmacist, however, that this is the first time that we find ourselves having to authorise foodstuffs like medicines; this kind of compulsory authorization is something new."
"All foodstuffs which are being marketed for the first time, even those which have not been genetically modified or produced by means of genetically modified organisms, now come under this regulation and must be authorised."
"If, for example, kiwis were not known in Europe then they would have to be subject to these rules and receive authorization, just like medicines, before they could be marketed."
"Where should the line be drawn for the requirements of this regulation?"
"Are we moving towards a time when all food will have to be accompanied by an information leaflet?"
"Any foodstuffs which contain or consist of genetically modified organisms must be labelled as such."
"In addition under the new regulation there must be a label on all foodstuffs which in their composition, nutritious characteristics or application are not equivalent to usual or established products and where labelling is necessary for ethical or health reasons."
"This lack of 'equivalence' must be determined through a scientific assessment in which changes coming within the natural fluctuations are disregarded."
"This differentiation meets the demands of the cropper and the foodstuffs monitoring authority for a practical solution and the consumer is also adequately protected and informed."
"A particular circumstance can only be labelled if it can actually be proved in the end product."
"This regulation meets the requirements for truth and clarity."
"The compromise has yet to be assessed for its detailed effect, to ensure that it meets the requirement of the European legislator that it is proper for present and future situations."
"Labelling products, however, will not provide the consumer with anything more than an indication that genetic technology was used in the production of the goods and the changes that its use has produced."
"In addition to this we shall have to inform the consumer of the background and the significance of the procedures used so that he is given reassurance."
"It is only through well founded explanations that we can combat hysteria and ease the way for novel food on to the European market."
"Consumers are turning against genetically modified foodstuffs on a massive scale."
"But genetically modified foods are still on their way to Europe from the USA."
"No political force will prevent that from happening."
"That is why the political campaign is being directed towards health and environmental assessments and rules on labelling."
"In general terms, the right wing does not wish to 'put obstacles in the way' of industry, whilst the social democrats instinctively base their stance on the attitude of consumers."
"We wish to have extensive labelling rules for products which get through the health and environmental assessments."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt should be commended on the impressive result which she has achieved through the conciliation procedure."
"She really has secured as much as possible from the basis on which we went into the negotiations. There must be no risks for consumers, they must not be misled, and novel foods must not have a lower nutritional value."
"Parliament has forced through the requirement that all modified foodstuffs are to be labelled, and prevented an exception for plants which are resistant to chemical sprays."
"Bulk consignments which may contain genetically modified organisms are to be labelled."
"In this way, feed companies, farmers, abattoirs and the retail trade can make a choice."
"We cannot yet be sure, by sending a p√¢t√© to a laboratory for tests, whether the pig from which the liver p√¢t√© was produced was fed on genetically modified soya beans."
"But consumers wish to know that."
"The regulation does indeed say that it should be possible to identify genetic modifications, and techniques for detection are being developed all the time."
"However, the retail sector must take care that its customers do not come to feel deceived, if it wishes to remain in the market."
"When we adopted the rules on the irradiation of foodstuffs, the technique for detecting it had not been developed."
"It has been in the meantime, and we have the same hopes with regard to novel foods."
"I have heard farmers complaining about feed having to be labelled as to whether it is genetically modified, but surely farmers do not buy feed without knowing its nutritional value?"
"Surely they should be aware of a production method which can influence sales?"
"The novel foods regulation is essential, because it is the only option at present."
"This regulation can only be of benefit, as opposed to an internal market with no rules at all."
"It is too naive to think that the absence of EU rules will lead to 15 excellent national regimes."
"After 13 redrafts by the Commission and three readings in this House, the novel food regulation remains a deeply flawed piece of legislation."
"Although it is put forward as a consumer protection measure, it contains too many loopholes, exceptions and restrictions to be an acceptable means of regulating the new gene foods as they come on to the market."
"Many categories of foodstuffs produced with the aid of gene technology will be regulated under other legislation or not at all."
"Others will simply require a notification by the manufacturers to the Commission at the same time that they are placed on the market, with no independent safety or environmental assessments."
"Only where the food contains a living genetically modified organism will the regulation apply in full."
"This category would cover raw fruit and vegetables, some dairy products like yoghurt and some beers but not very much else."
"Even for these products, there will be no long term independent health and safety assessments."
"Consumers are entitled to clear and consistent information to enable them to make informed choices."
"The most damning aspect of this regulation is that no-one can say in advance which products will carry a label."
"A coherent system should be one which provides quite simply that all foods produced using gene technology will be labelled."
"The procedure foreseen in the legislation means that the Commission will have exclusive powers to decide on a case-bycase basis whether consumers will be informed and what the label will say."
"There is to be no Public Register of approved gene foods, so the transparency provisions currently in force under Directive 90/220 will disappear."
"Bulk shipments of mixed conventional and modified food crops such as soya and maize have been sanctioned by the regulation, further weakening the scope for responsible supermarkets to offer their customers a choice."
"In those cases where these are to be labelled, it will be an almost meaningless statement that the product may contain genetically modified material."
"Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK all have stronger legislation in the pipeline or voluntary schemes already in existence."
"As this is an EU regulation entering directly into force in Member States, they will have no opportunity to enact stricter safeguards."
"There are no provisions in the law to govern the export of gene foods from EU territory which means that these may be shipped overseas without a licence or any labelling."
"For these reasons, we voted against the adoption of the joint text."
"This report is incomplete."
"There are far too many loopholes, exceptions and restrictions to be an acceptable means of regulating 'novel food' ."
"Only food containing live genetically modified organisms will be adequately regulated."
"The consumer must be able to make a free, individual choice on which food they want to buy and consume."
"This means that they need to know exactly what they are buying and this is achieved by means of clear labelling on the product."
"There is no proposal for a joint register of approved genetically modified foodstuffs either."
"Many Member States such as Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Great Britain already have or are planning stricter legislation or voluntary agreements."
"As this Directive, if approved, will come into force immediately and will supersede national legislation, it could lead to a lowering of standards and security and consequently a reduction in consumer protection in many Member States."
"Nor is there any ban, regulation or control on genetically modified foodstuffs which may be exported from the EU to other countries."
"These are the reasons why I have voted against the report."
"After thirteen redrafts by the Commission and three readings in this House, the novel food regulation remains a deeply flawed piece of legislation."
"Although it is put forward as a consumer protection measure, it contains too many loopholes, exceptions and restrictions to be an acceptable means of regulating the new gene foods as they come on to the market."
"Many categories of foodstuffs produced with the aid of gene technology will be regulated under other legislation or not at all."

"There is no provision in the law to govern the export of gene foods from EU territory which means that these may be shipped overseas without a licence or any labelling."
"For these reasons I voted against the adoption of the joint text."
"We have just approved the regulation on novel foods."
"This represents progress in the area of preventive health measures and consumer protection."
"For questions relating to public health we rely on the Scientific Committee on Food."
"We have no reason to doubt the committee's professionalism or objectivity."
"But the findings of the temporary committee of inquiry into BSE suggest that caution is advisable."
"Both the membership of the Scientific Committee and the free availability of its opinion and what the Commission does with it are vitally important."
"In yesterday's committee of inquiry we welcomed Commission President Santer's intention regarding the scientific committees."
"We expect these intentions to be translated into decisions, with a view too to the implementation of this regulation."
"Peijs report (A4-0004/97)"
"We are very positive about the proposed Directive as it will improve the quality of cross border payments and it is a prerequisite for the orderly functioning of the internal market."
"But we consider that the Directive would have been even more satisfactory if no limit had been placed on the pay back guarantee to the customer in the event that the transfer of credit does not take place."
"We also consider that the time limit allowed for the transaction should not exceed 12 months."
"Ladies and gentlemen. Transfers from one Member State to another in the European Union is still a lengthy and expensive business."
"European citizens and in particular small and medium-sized companies find the difficulties involved not simply annoying but in some cases also extremely expensive."
"The European single market is not yet a fact of life in this sphere."
"Meanwhile some banks in border regions have introduced cost-saving methods of transfer."
"Giro systems which should lead to quicker and cheaper money transfers within the European Union are being set up."
"I am confident that fair competition between the cross-border transfer systems leads to better, more favourable supply."
"The present proposal for a directive on cross-border transfers has very definite repercussions on citizens' everyday life in Europe."
"Our objective was to make cross-border transfers quicker, cheaper and more reliable."
"I welcome the joint draft before us which represents an excellent solution."
"From the first reading in May 1995 to today we represented Parliament's view in intensive discussions and negotiations and I believe we have made a considerable improvement on the original proposal in the citizen's interests."
"One example of what I mean is the scope of application of the directive where our upper limit of ECU 50, 000 was finally accepted in place of the original ECU 30, 000."
"I think this is particularly important since a series of transactions of small and medium-sized firms now come under this directive."
"Another important amendment dealt with the credit advice of transfer amounts to the mandator if they had not reached the beneficiary for any reason."
"Up to ECU 10, 000 was to be credited back to the mandator under the Council's common position."
"We finally managed to have this amount increased to ECU 12, 500."
"Even although this is well below what Parliament originally asked for I nevertheless believe that we can accept it in view of what we have achieved elsewhere."
"The case of cross-border transfers is to my mind a clear example of the significance and success of the co-decision procedure."
"We have seen here that we can achieve a great deal if we enter negotiations with clear objectives."
"Incidentally I would like to point out that with the introduction of a common currency the importance of the subject will inevitably wane, with the exception of various legal points."
"In conclusion I wish to thank everyone involved for their hard work which has led to this agreement which is satisfactory to all concerned."
"I believe that this has overcome another hurdle and taken another step closer to the European single market."
"Medina Ortega recommendation (A4-0415/96)"
"On behalf of the French socialist group, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, for the excellent work he has done."
"Mr Medina has produced this important report unassisted."
"On the whole, I believe he has found adequate formulae for the protection of personal data in the telecommunications sector."
"We have had a few difficulties with the second reading amendments."
"In France, we have a red list system which effectively protects the identity of subscribers wanting this facility in return for a modest fee."
"On this point, we fear that the proposed free service will weaken the protection of subscribers."
"The experience of certain States who use this system is not encouraging."
"We are also concerned by the problem of identification during incoming calls."
"In some cases (SOS AIDS or SOS Battered Wives for example), it is vital that the anonymity of the caller is protected."
"We think the proposed provisions are inadequate."
"A solution to these problems could have been found in the context of the subsidiarity principle."
"The amendments dismiss the application of the principle for reasons I do not share."
"As a result, we could not vote for some of the amendments proposed at second reading."
"As everyone knows, the purpose of this proposal for a directive is to guarantee free movement of telecommunications data, services and equipment and the achievement of this aim has been aided by the amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading, which have been taken into account. However, it would be desirable to limit the Member States' margin of manoeuvre by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, because the telecommunications sector is essentially transnational."
"It is likewise important to guarantee that the protection of data and privacy in telecommunications services costs subscribers nothing."
"We support the amendments maintaining that harmonization of telecommunications does not lend itself to the principle of subsidiarity because of the essentially transnational character of telecommunications networks and services, and that, in any case, such harmonization will have to guarantee that no obstacles are put in the way of promotion and development of new telecommunications services and new networks between Member States."
"We are also in favour of promoting cooperation between the Member States, the providers and users affected and the Community authorities for the establishment and development of technologies which are necessary to apply the guarantees laid down in the provisions of this directive."
"The amendments which guarantee that the protection of data and privacy in telecommunications services do not cost subscribers anything are very important."
"Operators should not be allowed to demand payment from subscribers for guaranteeing respect for the right to privacy."
"We agree that the protection of privacy must be free."
"In short, our group is in favour of the majority of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on the common position of the Council, as this initially involved regulating the issue of protection of personal data and privacy in telecommunications without leaving it to arbitrary decisions of private companies."
"More specifically we support the positive aspects of this proposal like the interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity in a way that limits Member States' margin of manoeuvre in the telecommunications sector because of its essentially transnational character and the defence of the principle of free protection of privacy."
"Kerr report (A4-0367/96)"
"The Danish social democrats support the rapporteur's rejection of the change in the definition of the concept of 'transfers' ."
"Changing the definition would involve the risk of a substantial reduction in employees' rights."
"We are naturally opposed to that."
"It cannot be right that employees should have to pay because a business changes hands."
"We are pleased that this report has been adopted at last."
"It was a difficult struggle, and the careless Swedish translation was just the last straw. Mr Kerr proved himself a successful go-between here."
"The rapporteur has introduced relevant clarifications and improvements on the Commission's proposals on the unsolved legal questions, the term 'transition' and the increasing practice of 'outsourcing' ; in particular he fended off attempts to exclude either completely or nearly completely from the new regulation the award of services to outside."
"We welcome that."
"However, we are still left with the task of finding suitable regulatory means of strengthening the weakened opportunities of participation in relation to the undertaking's organisation and activity."
"That will be one of the main tasks of the coming post-neoliberal years, we hope."
"Bertens report (A4-0416/96)"
"We welcome the initiative of the Commission and the committee for increased cooperation between the EU and the countries of Latin America."
"A global strategy for economic cooperation should be established along with more intensive political cooperation in order to promote peace, democracy and respect for human rights in Latin America."
"We do not consider that those aspects of defence between the Union and these countries which we have discussed fall within the framework of this report."
"Paragraph 25 of this report contains a further increase in the funds already available to Latin America."
"We believe that the European Union is already one of the biggest contributors in this region."
"In general terms we are in favour of advancing the process of democracy in this region and the development of the country."
"The important thing as far as we are concerned is that the current projects can be proved to be efficient, for that is the only guarantee that the money is being used properly."
"Until such time as we have specific figures on these projects we do not wish to comment on this paragraph 25."
"As paragraphs 21 to 34 are being put to the vote together and we approve of all these paragraphs with the exception of paragraph 25, but have no opportunity to vote separately on it, we give our approval to this bloc voting while abstaining on paragraph 25."
"Carnero Gonz√°lez report (A4-0418/96)"
"Paragraphs 16 and 18 of this report contain a further increase in the funds already available to Central America or a partial exemption from the foreign debts of Central America."
"In general terms we are in favour of advancing the process of democracy in this region and the development of the country."
"The important thing as far as we are concerned is that the current projects can be proved to be efficient, for that is the only guarantee that the money is being used properly."
"Until such time as we have specific figures on these projects we do not wish to comment on paragraphs 16 and 18."
"As paragraphs 11 to 25 are being put to the vote together and we approve of all these paragraphs with the exception of paragraphs 16 and 18, but have no opportunity to vote separately on them, we give our approval to this bloc voting while abstaining on paragraphs 16 and 18."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.38 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Community forestry strategy (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0414/96) by Mr Thomas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on a global Community strategy for the forestry sector."
"Mr President, the European Parliament's proposal for a future EU forestry strategy has changed fundamentally over the year and a half during which it was under consideration in committee."
"The forestry strategy represents a compromise agreed in committee."
"Although a compromise can never be entirely satisfactory, I am pleased with the ultimate result as a Finn and therefore a representative of the European country most dependent on its forests, considering how enormously the proposal has been improved in comparison with the original draft."
"Rather than a common forestry policy, we are now considering a common forestry strategy."
"The basic point of departure is a recognition of the differences between the Member States' forests, in terms both of conditions and of significance."
"According to this strategy, the use and protection of forests remain matters for national decision-making."
"Nonetheless, an effort is being made to work towards common objectives through common action."
"According to the strategy, the current fragmented action is to be coordinated with the aim of preserving the diversity of forests, adopting an ecologically sound approach and sustainable economic and social use."
"The forestry strategy stresses the significance of forests as a renewable natural resource."
"Correctly used, the forests function as a reserve for sustainable economic development, which means work and prosperity for people."
"Forestry is among the sectors where open competition prevails in the EU, and industry must operate without subsidies or regulations which distort competition."
"The forests maintain a living countryside, various industries and much small enterprise, which provides employment."
"According to the forestry strategy, it is possible to combine the preservation of forests' biodiversity and recreational functions with their so-called economic use."
"Finland's forestry industry, with its right of access for all and growing reserves of wood, is an excellent example of this."
"The strategy presents opportunities for the EU to promote environmentally benign exploitation of forests in contexts other than the allocation of regional funding."
"The EU can be actively involved in bringing influence to bear on the establishment of an international certification system which takes account of the special features of each country."
"An effective environmental labelling system and the provision of information about the sustainable forestry associated with it could promote the multifunctional use of wood, which is a considerably more environmentally benign material than unrenewable natural resources."
"The use of wood and biofuels as energy sources, with the aid of advanced technology, could afford new opportunities for the creation of a greener Europe."
"The forestry strategy will introduce a stronger environmental element into forestry."
"It stresses principles agreed at the UN conference on environment and development in Rio and the conclusions of the Helsinki ministerial conference on sustainable woodland management and preserving the diversity of forests. The EU Member States have also committed themselves to these."
"Mr President, in conclusion I should like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues for their cooperation in drawing up the forestry strategy and to express the hope that we will be able to agree on the compromise which was its outcome."
"Mr President, the painful genesis of the Thomas report at least showed that the forestry issues which arise in the various regions of the Union are very different."
"The fact is that the Commission has no reason to make haste with a heavy legislative programme which would in effect transfer substantial powers with regard to forestry affairs from the Member States to the Union."
"The report has something of the Trojan horse about it: on the one hand, it stresses the position of the Member States by referring to the subsidiarity principle, while on the other hand the Commission is asked in two years' time to produce a legislative programme based particularly on Article 235 of the Treaty."
"As you know, this article is a kind of black hole by means of which the European Union draws power away from the Member States."
"In their own proposals, the Greens stress that the forests must be considered in a balanced manner from the points of view of sustainable use, social benefit and environmental protection."
"We would like the Commission to engage in cooperation, for example with the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), with the aim of adopting an internationally recognized certification system."
"In this way the Commission could also help to ensure that this system is adapted to European conditions."
"If extra funding is wanted for the forestry industry, we recommend that it be used to safeguard the diversity of forests."
"In our view, the Habitat Directive should be taken seriously, and funding should be found for its conservation area network for forests."
"In this way it might also be possible to find money to protect Scandinavia's last surviving ancient forests."
"Mr President, the Helsinki resolutions give an excellent definition of what sustainability means in relation to forestry."
"The definition takes into account not only the quantitative sustainability but also the ecological sustainability of forestry."
"The common practice amongst foresters was, until Helsinki, just to stick to the rule that you could not harvest more timber than was growing back."
"The more ecologically orientated people amongst us foresters pleaded at that time that we should take into consideration not only the timber flow but equally the protection function of the forests and also the production of non-timber values from forests."
"The ministerial conference of Helsinki which took place about three-and-a-half years ago took our requirements into consideration."
"So I am really pleased that the motion for resolution, which we worked out in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, refers explicitly to the commitments of the European Union in Helsinki and also to our commitments in the Rio Declaration."
"The motion for a resolution is, of course, a compromise."
"I can tell you it took a lot of work behind the scenes to get this compromise."
"Now let me tell what I do not like in the compromise."
"If you are, on the one hand, claiming that forest management should respect the multi-functional nature of forests, on the other hand - we refer to the Rio and Helsinki Declarations - it makes no sense to say that the commercial utilization of forests should be a priority for the EU strategy."
"Positive from an ecological point of view is that we emphasize the protection function of the forest; that we want to protect and enhance the biological and economic value of our forests, especially in threatened areas like mountainous regions; that we ask to take into account the carbon sink function, especially by encouraging the production of long-living forest products."
"Some people wonder why we do not propose to implement a common forest policy similar to the common agricultural policy, but just a strategy."
"I have full understanding for the Scandinavian countries and also Austria, which do not want the same fiasco which we had in the common agricultural policy before their arrival in the Community to be repeated in the forestry sector."
"Nevertheless, I think, personally, that it makes sense to introduce a system of price intervention for used paper to promote paper recycling."
"Wood fibre products are a very precious natural resource and play a role in the carbon sink cycle."
"The more often they are recycled, the better they fulfil their carbon sink function."
"Let me now talk about certification."
"Consumers have the right to know where the products - be it window frames or paper products - come from."
"There must be transparency of origin."
"Consumers have the right to know whether wood products come from forests managed on the principle of ecological sustainability or from a destructive operation."
"I would recommend focusing on certification schemes like that of the Forest Stewardship Council but I would like also to warn against systems similar to the one proposed by the Canadian Standards Association."
"This system certainly does not guarantee transparency of origin but just serves the interests of an industry that does not want to change."
"A serious certification system could not only be beneficial to the conservation of our forests but also to the forest owners who manage their forests wisely."
"For my country, Luxembourg, where a large portion of our territory is covered by forest eco-systems which are managed in a way which is close to nature, a certification scheme would certainly be a big advantage for selling our wood products on the market."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, David Thomas, for the work he has done to secure a broadly acceptable compromise."
"I know this work has not always been easy."
"As Mr Thomas has said, the use, management and conservation of European forests cannot be controlled by common rules, given how different the forests are in different parts of the European Union."
"This fact is the premise of the report."
"However, there should be certain common principles to enable us to safeguard the sustainable use of forests."
"To this end, a common strategy is needed which takes into account and reconciles the varies types of use to which forests are put and need to be put."
"The common forestry strategy should take account of the multifunctionality of forests: forests are needed to combat the greenhouse effect, conserve biodiversity and provide opportunities for recreation and landscape values."
"But forests are also valuable and important as a renewable resource, a source of raw materials and energy for many different industries."
"Thus the common forestry strategy, the industrial use of wood and wood production should all be based on the principles of the market economy, not on subsidies or on rules which distort competition."
"The EU's forestry strategy should also be based on the coordination of national policies on the basis of common principles."
"One of the things which should be done at European level is to organize joint research into the development of forestry resources and the health of forests."
"A relatively large sum has been assigned to forestry in the Union budget: some ECU 400 million."
"A common strategy is needed to ensure that this money can be used sensibly and not, for example, in ways which distort competition."
"We need to know what this money is being used for and what our priorities are."
"Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for an interesting and comprehensive report."
"The forestry industry is extremely important in my country, Sweden."
"Our net export of forestry products is approximately 70 billion Crowns which corresponds to 8 billion ECUs."
"In fact, half of Swedish net exports are products from the forestry industry."
"We have quite recently introduced legislation in Sweden for the forestry sector."
"We have moved away from detailed production legislation, which tightly controlled the methods of production which could be used by the individual forest owner, to more general legislation which gives equal weight to the needs of production and the environment and in which the obligation to replant after felling is unequivocally stated, all in accordance with the declarations and fundamental views of the Rio Conference and Agenda 21."
"During the preparation of this report, we were very concerned that it would advocate a joint forestry policy with tight control from above."
"This hazard has been avoided."
"In my opinion, such a move would have led to greater bureaucracy and a move away from the principles of the market economy."
"We would all have been the losers under such a proposal."
"The current proposal includes a number of ideas on cooperation within the sector which can really be of benefit."
"I am referring to research, the establishment of an inventory of forestry assets, measures to prevent damage to Europe's forests from air pollution, joint measures against forest fires, all of which complement national and individual measures."
"It must also be in our joint interest to be able to demonstrate that Europe's forests are managed in a sustainable manner and that great care is taken to maintain biological diversity."
"Certification which inspires trust and respect could also be an advantage as part of a joint voluntary regime."
"It must be in our common interest, in those regions where forests have been devastated, to reinstate this important resource."
"This could take place within the framework of regional political programmes supported by the EU."
"The forests of Europe also have an important role to play in terms of the greenhouse effect."
"As long as there is less felling than growth, coal is stored in our forests and can therefore contribute to a reduction in excess carbon dioxide obtained through the burning of fossil fuels."
"It would be even better if we used a proportion of our joint excess as biological fuel."
"I continue to maintain that by following the direction taken in the report, the European forestry sector will prove to be a very good example to the world in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was essential that the European Union define a forestry strategy in order to improve the use and management of forestry resources."
"All types of forest are represented in Europe, from taiga to the tropical forests of Guyana, and we must ensure their continued existence by preserving the biodiversity of these very fragile ecosystems."
"Forests occupy a privileged position in today's society."
"Over the last few years, we have seen the appearance of much development and exploitation of woodland areas."
"As regards protection, we must fight against erosion by preventing such forestry practices as clear felling."
"Methods for conserving genetic resources must be strengthened by encouraging seed selection and improvement."
"The fight to sustain plant health is still a priority among foresters."
"Greater attention must also be given to fire protection by encouraging prevention and detection."
"As regards forest use and exploitation, we should favour groups of small producers, advise owners about management and exploitation, and help with the mechanization of enterprises."
"The Commission should encourage the promotion of the timber industry."
"Wood is a renewable energy source."
"The Commission will also have to support the education of its citizens, especially the young."
"As for funding, the relationship between forests and cash is complex."
"In an economy obsessed with the short-term, with very stretched budgets, it is difficult to invest in production on a scale of centuries."
"Our forestry strategy should lay down firm guidelines which respect the subsidiarity principle."
"Europe must develop a voluntary policy supported by regular investment for both the protection and production of wood; a guarantee of long-term rural development."
"In conclusion, although our forests cover only a small area of the Earth, the forestry strategy of the European Union must become a world model for the management of resources and species."
"Mr President, forestry policy ought first and foremost to be a national matter."
"Joint strategies ought to be restricted to issues of a general character."
"Each country must be given the opportunity to develop their own forestry policy."
"Swedish forests, the backbone of the Swedish economy, are used ecologically and with care for the environment."
"Any joint strategy chosen for the forestry industry should be based on producing a commercial forestry sector, run under market conditions, without subsidies which distort competition."
"There is a risk that the use of subsidies will perpetuate an ineffective structure and reduce both short and long term profitability."
"Certification of forests should serve as a means of communication between the producer and the consumer."
"This ought to form part of Community policy, like the quality mark."
"It is possible to give legitimate economic support for various environmental measures or for use in the fight against forest fires for example, but even here the main responsibility should rest with the Member States."
"It is also important that fresh ideas are not unfairly treated as a result of political decisions."
"A European campaign to promote the use of wood and wood products is being proposed."
"If such a campaign does take place it ought to include paper as well."
"Like wood products, paper products are also under pressure from substitutes such as plastic, glass and metals."
"It is preferable to link forestry issues with issues related to the forestry industry and not to agricultural policy."
"As a representative of Europe's most densely forested country, I would just like to say the following to any potential supporters of a fully regulated, joint forestry policy: to those who wish ill on Europe's forestry industry, there is now a fate worse than more forest fires."
"This is a forestry policy similar to the European CAP."
"Mr President, this is why it is pleasing that the compromise proposal which is under consideration here is not aimed at such a development at all."
"Mr President, the Thomas report is very ambitious but there must be strong doubts as to whether, in general, it is possible to formulate a joint policy for all the countries of the Union in such a complicated area as this."
"Basically, there are very different conditions in the different regions and countries of the Union."
"In many countries, the forests are so neglected that extensive programmes are needed to rehabilitate them, whereas exactly the opposite is the case in Scandinavia."
"Here, there is no desire to further enlarge the forest, instead people are anxious to preserve the open landscape and the biological diversity that it represents."
"Because of this, the report is so general and so diluted that it barely gives any direction."
"It could serve only to complicate the issue for more substantive and practically national forestry policies."
"The report also has obvious difficulty in reconciling different views and opposing interests."
"On the one hand forest protection is highlighted, while on the other, the emphasis is placed, and indeed priority is placed, on better commercial use."
"How is this to be interpreted?"
"Is this to be at the price of more biological monoculture or of planting species not native to the national flora or which consume large quantities of water and put the surrounding area at risk?"
"I think that the European Union ought not to take on further new, difficult and wide reaching tasks."
"It already has enough work coping with the tasks in hand."
"The report also panders to what, unfortunately, is increasingly becoming a habit in many areas of the Union, that is the proposal of new subsidies, something which can hardly have been very well thought out in the current budget situation."
"If we want subsidies, we ought, at least, to be looking for alternative means of making savings, in the excessive set aside subsidies to large farmers growing cereals and oil plants for example."
"What this report really says to me is that there is a desire, at any price, to expand the European Union's power instead of allowing the Union, more sensibly, to concentrate on finding the best way of managing the tasks which it has already accepted responsibility for."
"Mr President, we have heard from the rapporteur and from some of those who have participated in the preparation of the report that this should not pave the way for EU forestry policy."
"Despite this, I believe that some of those who have participated in this work do think that this is the case and view it as a step towards this."
"As a forest owner in Northern Sweden, I do not think that we need such a joint forestry policy."
"Of course there are some good ideas in this report, including those concerned with the environment and with certification, but the question is how much space will be allocated to these ideas in a joint forestry strategy."
"The tone of the report is set right from the first point where it states that commercial use of forests should be given priority in the EU's forestry strategy."
"This clearly shows what the report is aimed at."
"If it doesn't, let me mention another point, point 9 where it says that the 'Commission will be asked to recommend adaptation of those goals and actions affected, particularly in Regulation 1610/89, to the real needs of supporting the management and use of forests' . It is a question of 'use' and in the English original the word 'exploitation' is actually used."
"What this means in plain language is that EU support is to be used for the exploitation of forests."
"I think this is terrible."
"The more environmentally friendly wording is retracted in the next breath and replaced with the notion that the role of the forest and its value to tourism and recreation must be acknowledged without unnecessary restriction on the economic use of the forest."
"All this, Mr President, leads me to believe that we should vote against this report, especially if we compare it with Swedish forestry legislation which is much better, but still much discussed in Sweden."
"If this is passed we will be forced to rewrite this legislation and it will become totally and utterly useless."
"The initial aim of this report, drawn up on Parliament's initiative, was a general reflection on the basic features of a common forestry policy and a request to the European Commission to propose appropriate legislative measures to attain these objectives on bases and guidelines laid down by ourselves as parliamentarians."
"I would like to remind you that, from South to North, forests of all kinds cover a third of European Union territory."
"They are a vital element in future rural development in line with the European countryside charter that we have examined and voted upon in this very place."
"What are the problems with forests?"
"The absence of a legal basis in the European Union Treaty and the fact that timber, originating from living plant matter, is considered merely as an industrial product, are obstacles to the establishment of a European forestry strategy."
"We should like these legal and technical points to be taken into consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference for inclusion in the future appropriately-amended Union Treaty."
"Next, the recent arrival of three new well-forested Member States, Austria, Sweden and Finland, has increased the mean forest area in the Union from 21 % to 34 %."
"There is quite strong opposition in these new States to any common forestry policy that might resemble a new CAP, particularly with regard to forest management and exploitation, and even more with regard to the timber and wood pulp markets."
"The first version of the Thomas report was incomplete, but incorporated in its final compromise version are a good many amendments, particularly those that I was also able to submit with members of the Intergroup on Forestry."
"Although this new draft is satisfactory, some points still need clarification, and that is why I tabled a few additional amendments."
"To begin with, we emphasize the need for a reference to Article 130 of the Union Treaty which implies codecision and financial support from the Cohesion Fund."
"Secondly, in the second amendment, we point out that the coordination of forestry strategy with the other policies on the environment and rural development must actually be mentioned."
"Thirdly, it is stressed that the multi-functional role - socio-economic, environmental and recreational - must form the basis for long-term development of forests."
"Finally, in the last amendment, we call on the Commission to propose measures to guarantee economic development of forests linked to farming."
"I therefore ask you to support these amendments and urge you to give your closest attention to future legislative proposals from the Commission that we shall have to examine carefully in order to establish a genuine European forestry strategy capable of providing us with self-sufficiency in timber and other forestry products, as we have in food."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by complimenting my colleague, Mr Thomas, on the work he has done."
"This debate here today illustrates how difficult a task he has in trying to balance and bring together the competing philosophies on this subject."
"However, I would like to address two practical points to the Commission."
"One is that, given the relative importance of forestry to what are very often fragile rural economies, I would like the Commission to take account of the part it can play in rural development and, in this respect, it is vital that we attempt to retain as much of the added value of forestry products in the local community as possible."
"I would like to ask the Commission to encourage practices and projects which seek to meet this objective."
"Similarly, as forests mature and technology advances, sometimes access to forests for harvesting can present quite a problem."
"This is the case in my part of the world - roads and bridges need to be strengthened and maintained - and all this against a background of constrained budgets - certainly local authority budgets."
"I would therefore like to ask if the Commission would look favourably on encouraging Objective 5b funds to be used for this type of infrastructure."
"In general, I welcome the rapporteur's acknowledgement that forests provide much more than the simple exploitation of their economic potential and that much of the value of forests cannot be easily quantified in cold facts and figures."
"Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the contribution that forests make to the benefit of society as a whole and we must continue to develop at international level cooperation and sustainable management."
"Perhaps the best service which the Commission can render at European level is to ensure that information and expertise is available and shared within the European Union in order that we can build on the existing pool of knowledge and practice."
"Mr President, fundamentally the Thomas report is a compromise between the different functions of what should be regarded as the European forest."
"Obviously this is not the text that some of us wanted, but I would say that it is broadly acceptable as amended during its progress through Parliament."
"I would like to emphasize the most important aspects of what a European forestry policy should be, as I understand it."
"Of course we all recognize the environmental function, but I want to say that the economic function of the forest should be openly recognized, because everyday reality demonstrates that there is no protection for anything that has no value."
"The protection of the forest is a need which is better fulfilled when it relates to a profitable asset."
"It is important that we develop this socio-economic potential."
"And it is also important to develop and recognize the principle of subsidiarity to the maximum, because, amongst other things, the European forest is very diverse and the social and economic players in each case are different too, as are the environmental characteristics of each European forest."
"To give an example, the Atlantic forest, which comes into the area I represent, is highly productive and 80 % privately owned by over two million individual proprietors."
"As a result it has enormous social repercussions, including, of course, on employment."
"But its characteristics are quite different from the Mediterranean forest, the Nordic forest and the central European forest."
"So we must respect this principle of subsidiarity and it must also extend to regional level."
"Sometimes we talk about subsidiarity in Europe as only extending to state level but there is no national forestry policy in Spain, for instance."
"In almost every case, responsibility for forests lies with the regions, which have legal forestry plans, naturally legitimized by their parliaments as well, and these fully-empowered regions should also be given legitimate scope in relation to the European Union in this sector."
"Once the economic function of the forest is recognized as well as its environmental function, and once subsidiarity is taken into account, I think we need to be capable, at European level, of creating a scenario appropriate to investment in a forestry sector where ownership is extremely widespread and that means creating a dynamic climate for forestry investment, increasing the use of wood and its derivatives, a natural renewable material."
"I do not have time to go into this fully, but let me just give an outline."
"The scenario should include encouraging tax incentives at state level, boosting basic and applied research on the uses of wood, gearing European forestry aid to local authority control of the risk of forest fires, as well as ensuring the future viability of new forest stands and I would add encouraging the formation of foresters' organizations and including them in the Community's consultative bodies."
"Of course much more can be done, but equilibrium between the environmental, socio-economic and recreational functions of the European forest can be promoted along these lines."
"And one final thought, Mr President."
"We are also concerned about the tropical forests the world's ecological balance depends on, and we recognize that the greatest contribution we can make to saving these vital tropical forests is for Europe one day to become self-sufficient in forestry resources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage in the debate stress should be placed on the particular aspects we regard as most important, because general analysis has been covered by colleagues in earlier speeches."
"I would like to highlight the fact that the merit of the Thomas report is to examine a sector which not only has a commercial value, as stated in the report, but also has an impact on the environment and the countryside as a whole, with very different incidence across the European Union."
"That is why I want to draw particular attention to the need, in implementing the report's proposals, to consider the European forests as two large groups: the central and northern European forest and the Mediterranean forest."
"These two large groups have different characteristics and a different influence on society, and the forests of the south are also the best bulwark against erosion and desertification, in addition to their environmental contribution."
"So I want to stress the variable importance of the forests as a function of their geographical zones."
"In terms of operational capacity, responsibility for forests is currently shared between nine different areas of the European Commission, and more rational administration is clearly needed if the European Parliament's proposals are to prosper."
"Mr President, the Thomas report has taken a somewhat strange turn."
"After it was presented in the Committee on Agriculture some 200 to 220 amendments were tabled."
"After that there was a compromise to group these amendments or to withdraw some of them."
"What emerged from that is not much of an improvement."
"We think it is so patchy that we decided to table a few amendments, especially on the economic utilization side to stress that the forestry sector must have a natural and sustainable development and to ensure that there would be no common market organisation similar to a common agriculture regulation for wood."
"In agriculture that has contributed considerably to the destructive developments."
"What we want instead is for the EU in a concentrated and limited fashion to secure a market immune to dumping from outside."
"We need certification in which ecological criteria are agreed on an international basis and then recognised by the EU so that a wood industry can develop in the EU where the value of wood is economically anchored."
"For a long time the price development in the wood sector was so disastrously low that re-afforestation could not be financed by it and repeated subsidies for re-afforestation were given by the EU which were not of course given in other countries."
"We cannot transport a disastrous EU price policy to the outside because as we have already seen forests, and rain forests in particular, would be dragged down in its wake."
"We need woods in general to survive."
"And that is why the EU must deal with this subject matter in an international context and not set up a regulation solely for within the EU."
"Mr President, the Swedish Social Democrats find it very difficult to support the Thomas report."
"This should not be seen as a criticism against the report itself but more a way of expressing our scepticism of a joint forestry strategy for the Union."
"We think that the principle of proximity should apply for this sector."
"We have enough problems within the Union adapting our agricultural and regional policies for enlargement towards the East."
"There is absolutely no reason for the Union to take upon itself another political area."
"As many speakers have pointed out, the problems vary enormously in the Countries of the Union."
"The Southern countries have too little forest while the Northern countries probably have too much."
"The Southern countries have problems with forest fires while in the North it is the cold that we struggle with."
"There is no lack of forestry policy either, the reverse is true."
"Individual countries have forestry laws and the necessary authorities to administer these laws."
"There is no lack of international cooperation either."
"All the European forestry authorities cooperate within the ECE Timber Commission."
"At a global level there is cooperation within the framework of the FAO."
"Trade problems are resolved within the framework of the WTO and so on. There is also extensive cooperation taking place to detail forest damage."
"Very detailed statistics are published annually for the sector."
"As for environmental certification, this is of dubious value for the Scandinavian countries."
"We already have such certification, and it is well known that certain competitor countries on the other side of the Atlantic have exerted pressure on the Union to adopt certification at a lower level than we have in Scandinavia."
"Adoption of common certification would lead, therefore, to a lowering of environmental standards for the Swedish forestry industry."
"Finally, Mr President I consider it unnecessary that the Union is using this document to recommend new increased expenditure."
"Our budget is already under considerable strain."
"Mr President, the last enlargement brought a deeper interest and even a passion into the debate on forestry in this Community."
"It is interesting to see the geographic interest and to recognize the diversity that enlargement has brought to thinking on afforestation in the Union."
"I thank Mr Thomas for his report."
"In some of the opinions annexed to the report there are entirely different descriptions of the industry at European level than the one he gives."
"I take it that his is the correct one, that we are about selfsufficient since the Nordic countries joined. Another report says we are only half self-sufficient so it a pity that students or even planners looking at documents like this see such contradictions within a few pages."
"That of course is not the fault of the rapporteur."
"We should not get ideologically fixed on the whole question of whether we have a common policy or not."
"We have a common industrial and commercial policy and we can have a common forestry policy in the same way."
"We will not have one like the common agricultural policy."
"I could not go as far as Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"Obviously, we would not want to have guaranteed prices and intervention and export refunds."
"But if we have a common interest in the environment, a common interest in the economic welfare of the European Union, a common tourism policy and so on, it is realistic to think that we ought to have a common policy so far as forestry is concerned."
"It need not necessarily impose a major burden on the European Union budget."
"I come from a country where we have the fewest forests in the European Union."
"The Finns harvest something in the order of 50 million cubic metres annually."
"The area under afforestation is the size of England and Scotland."
"In Ireland we have about 2 million acres or 16 % of our agricultural land and our worse land at that."
"So, there is a great diversity."
"Obviously forestry will become very important commercially in Ireland but there is resistance from a social standpoint to replacement of the small farms on the marginal land by tracts of woodland."
"The European policy which seeks to assist us with the development of our afforestation is not all that popular in Ireland and yet I believe it is wise in the long run."
"We are planting 25, 000 hectares annually at the moment."
"That can give Ireland a value added income of approximately ¬£300m at today's prices and that is three times the amount our sheep farmers are able to earn from the entire production of sheep in Ireland at the moment."
"So, for us it is not only important for the environment but economically we can develop our forests into something very important."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my appreciation to rapporteur Thomas for the patient and constructive way that he has worked to produce this report."
"The forestry industry in Europe is very diverse with considerable variation in species between countries."
"This applies also to views on forestry policy."
"This is why such varied proposals have been put forward during the debate."
"Central Europe has long been demanding protection of our forests while the Southern States have long demanded a support system."
"This far reaching demand has now been dropped. This is a good thing, in my view, as it would involve problems both for the environment and for production in our forests."
"It has already been stated earlier in the debate that Swedish forestry legislation has allowed us to create a sustainable and strong forestry industry which maintains a balance between the interests of the environment and of production."
"This policy means that the renewable raw material base is used while at the same time maintaining biological diversity."
"It is important to make clear to other parts of Europe that the Scandinavian forestry sector is a resource which can be used profitably within the ecological framework without any State support."
"It is these differences between North and South, East and West which, on the whole, make a joint forestry policy inappropriate. Such a policy should not be introduced within the European Union."
"The document currently under consideration represents a compromise which we arrived at in the Agriculture Committee."
"For this reason, I think that we should accept it as it is without any of the amendments which have been put forward."
"Of course some important sections concerning both environmental and production issues, are missing, but the compromise is acceptable; we can live with it in Sweden."
"This is why I think that we shall be able to approve it here in Parliament when the time comes."
"Mr President, I must begin by greeting our new Vice-President, Mr Marinho, and congratulate him on being elected."
"The Thomas report has the great advantage of having aroused a wide-ranging debate on the subject of forests in the European Union."
"This debate has shown that unfortunately there is not a consensus about the place of forests in the framework of Community policy."
"The Thomas report merely proposes a common forestry strategy based on greater co-ordination of national policies and the strengthening of protection, training and information measures."
"This strategy was the only base of compromise which it was possible to reach in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Agriculture in particular, and Mr Thomas deserves our greatest support for the effort which he has made to bring the different sides closer together."
"I think that bringing about at this stage a common forestry strategy will only make sense if it is carried out gradually in the future as part of a genuine common forestry policy with express aims, the relevant application instruments and appropriate financial means."
"This is the only way in which we can solve problems such as the increase in forestry production and reducing the deficit, and of finding alternative occupation for land in terms of non-food and energy raw materials, the creation of employment in rural areas and protection from atmospheric pollution and forest fires, adding to the contribution which forests make to the environment and the economy alike, since if people are not given incentives in economic terms to invest in the forest, then they will do nothing to defend it."
"The activities proposed by the rapporteur - which are already a great advance on what we have at present - would cost the European Union some 350 million ECU per annum, an equivalent to 0.8 % of the CAP budget."
"It is easy to conclude that what has now been proposed in the report presented to the European Parliament is derisory in terms of the European Union's resources."
"It is particularly derisory given the strategic importance of this sector for the future of our society."
"In a country like Portugal, for example, where three million hectares are forested which represents onethird of the territory and 80 % of which are integrated into farms, it is nonsensical to set differences in the way in which agriculture and forestry are treated."
"First of all since the CAP reform in 1992 farming and forestry land are increasingly interchangeable in terms of market situation."
"Secondly because farmers tend to look upon forestry activities as a way of topping up their income earned from farming."
"However, just to refer to this situation is unacceptable!"
"I am going to support this report but I hope that the Commission is going to be more daring in its proposals than the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Thomas for his report on a subject which is very important to us in Finland."
"All Member States of Union have common interests in the state of the forests and their use; the forests serve to bind carbon dioxide, prevent erosion and provide opportunities for recreation."
"We should also not forget the spiritual values they possess, either."
"Finland is the only country in the world which is economically fairly dependent on forests."
"Finland's national wealth has been generated with the aid of forest-based production over the past 150 years."
"The annual growth of Finland's forests is now greater than ever before: more than 80 million cubic metres."
"Even after account has been taken of all the use made of them and natural elimination, Finland's forestry resources are increasing by more than 10 million cubic metres per annum."
"To my mind this is a practical demonstration that it has always been a vital necessity to us Finns, as it still is today, to take good care of our national resources, our forests."
"By way of an example of the responsibility displayed by the Finns over forestry issues, may I just mention the extensive conservation areas which have been instituted in recent decades in various parts of Finland."
"By means of them we are seeking to safeguard Finland's nature and the biodiversity of its forests."
"From these points of view, the report does not entirely come up to my hopes."
"The report stresses subsidies and regulations, whereas to my mind one should allow the market economy to resolve the issues at stake."
"Nor does the report take any account of the fact that, in Finland for example, most woodland belongs to small private proprietors."
"The report also recommends that consideration be given to setting up a European forestry school."
"I cannot support this idea, because in my opinion forestry education is already adequately organized within the territory of the Union, right up to university level."
"Nor can I endorse the view expressed in the report that there is a need to set up a Union forestry committee."
"Although the current improved version of the report still does not take enough account of the Nordic point of view, it is nonetheless considerably better than the original version, and I therefore consider that it should be adopted."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 30 January in Brussels."
"EC/Israel public procurement and telcommunications agreements"
"The next item is the report (A4-0357/96) by Mr De Clercq, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision (COM(96)0148 - C4-0323/96-96/0104(CNS)) concerning the conclusion of two agreements between the European Community and the State of Israel on procurement by government and telecommunications operators."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon's debate on the report from our colleague Mr De Clercq and on the conclusion of the EC/Israel public procurement and telecommunications agreements gives me a chance to make four points."
"Firstly, as President of the Europe-Israel Delegation, I wish to pay tribute to the work of our colleague, Mr De Clercq, who has worked very hard throughout these last few months to improve and develop relations between Europe and Israel."
"Secondly, it should be pointed out that these agreements fit perfectly into a continuation of the agreements that came into force a year ago and into the framework of the Europe-Israel association agreement approved here by a very large majority."
"Thirdly, I wish to emphasize the great importance of these latter agreements, which will enable Europe to benefit from Israeli high technology and will enable Israel, which wishes to build new public infrastructures (a metro has been mentioned), to call on European expertise."
"Both parties therefore benefit greatly from this, and we must recognize that this is not always the case in association agreements."
"I stress the importance of these agreements in the context of regional economic integration between Israel and its neighbours, in what we hope is the near future."
"Israel will then be a privileged intermediary for the European Union."
"Finally, and following on directly from the last point, I wish to express the satisfaction and delight of Europeans after the Hebron agreement of Tuesday evening and the reactivation of the peace process."
"I myself, as you know, have always been confident, but I can understand the misgivings and doubts."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on their courage and good sense."
"Europe has played a discreet but effective role, in particular with its special envoy whom we should also congratulate."
"In conclusion, I reaffirm that the development of our economic and scientific relations with Israel is one of the prime conditions for peace as well as being one of the first consequences."
"I am therefore pleased that we have been able to play a part here in these affairs during the last critical months."
"The future will be just as difficult and we must therefore still try and keep a cool head, and retain our common sense and sound appreciation of situations."
"The vote on the report of our colleague, Mr De Clercq, is therefore very important, both as a symbol of a constructive and effective process and above all in its practical and rapid effects on the economic and technological relations between Europe and Israel."
"Madam President, the conclusion of these two agreements is a further step towards achieving the European Union's goal of opening up the markets for public contracts further. And I think that is a very important and proper objective."
"Moreover, the two agreements flesh out the agreements concluded earlier by the European Union and Israel on greater political and economic cooperation, cooperation which I myself and my Group welcome most warmly."
"I also have a point to make concerning procedure."
"It is regrettable that procedural problems always arise when matters are dealt with by the Committee on External Economic Relations and that this committee so often has to fight to be treated properly."
"In this case the committee bowed to the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"I think that is a wise decision, if only to preserve the unity of the European Parliament over this procedure."
"I have little to add to the wise words spoken by Mr De Clercq, but I would just like to say following on from my comment on procedure that over the past seven and a half years of international agreements of the kind we are debating today - and far more importantly the GATT agreement - the European Parliament and the European Union have been in very good hands in the Committee on external Economic Relations due to the fact that Mr De Clercq was the chairman of that committee."
"In all honesty I am having trouble adjusting to the idea that in a few hours' time the Committee on External Economic Relations will have a new chairman and that Mr De Clercq will be serving the Union in a different capacity."
"But Mr De Clercq has done a great deal personally to promote the liberalization of international trade, which is economically very important to the European Union and to employment and I regard it as an honour and as a very great pleasure to have served on his committee for the past two and a half years."
"Madam President, first of all I must congratulate you on your new office and I must also congratulate Mr De Clercq on this report, which rounds off wonderfully his seven years as chairman of the committee."
"This House talked long and hard about the European Union's Association Agreement with Israel."
"These two agreements on public procurement and telecommunications agreements are a consequence of it."
"Mr De Clercq looked rather more at the technical considerations, but I am looking at it more from the point of view of foreign policy, the Barcelona initiative."
"It is a step along the road to reciprocal liberalization, but it is also a step along the way towards stability in the region."
"The interests of the Union and Israel are well served too."
"Israel is strong in high-tech, and we need that in Europe."
"Europe has a sizeable head start in public transport."
"Israel has ambitious plans in this area, including the building of an urban metro line, and that would be a huge challenge to any one country of the Union."
"Of course the Union's economic resources are not the same as Israel's, but we are going through a good patch."
"Thanks to the efforts of King Hussein of Jordan the peace process has moved on a pace and, if I read the situation aright, there is an increasing hope of greater economic involvement of the European Union in Israel and the region as a whole and that is the prospect today: liberalization is all very well, it is an economic thing, but the real issue is stability in the region."
"My Group, the Union for Europe Group, wholeheartedly endorses Mr De Clercq's report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament is today able to express an opinion on two proposed agreements between the European Union and Israel on public procurement."
"Although the two agreements are as such rather technical in nature - as has been pointed out here, particularly by the rapporteur - one concerns public procurement generally and the other procurement in the telecommunications sector specifically, it is clear that they represent a considerable step forward in opening up procurement at an international level."
"There is therefore a wider point here, above and beyond the purely technical matter of the two agreements."
"The Commission wishes to draw attention to a number of important points."
"In the case of the first agreement, Israel is enlarging upon and adding to the undertakings entered into through the agreement on public procurement; it includes the urban transport sector, an area in which the Union is particularly competitive, and removes a number of exemptions previously negotiated under the Government Procurement Agreement."
"In addition, it opens up local procurement to European Union undertakings, in sectors other than those previously envisaged."
"In the case of the second agreement on procurement in the telecommunications sector, Israel is immediately abolishing a 15 per cent price preference and gradually removing the provision on compensation that it was in fact accorded under the Government Procurement Agreement."
"Both agreements are the product of the closer - political and economic - relations established by the association agreement between Israel and the European Union, and the post-Barcelona context of which this initiative forms part has already been mentioned. Secondly, they make a real contribution to economic development and, therefore, also to the political stability of the region."
"Thirdly, they secure for the European Union more favourable treatment than Israel has hitherto accorded other third countries, by offering further economic opportunities to European suppliers."
"Fourthly, they seem to us to be giving a positive signal and therefore constitute a positive precedent for other third countries in terms of opening-up markets on a reciprocal basis: this is a completely new element."
"For those reasons, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously endorsed the resolution approving the two agreements, after the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights had confirmed the legal basis proposed by the Commission."
"Let me take this opportunity of thanking those committees for their work and support and, in particular, the Commission wishes to thank Mrs Sierra Gonz√°lez of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for her contribution and, clearly, Mr de Clercq for having prepared the very clear and balanced report we are today debating."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Consultation of workers"
"The next item is the report (A4-0411/96) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, on the communication from the Commission on worker information and consultation (COM(95)0547 - C4-0538/95)."
"Madam President, Commissioner. May I point out that in addition to my five minutes as rapporteur I have a further three minutes on behalf of my group?"
"The European Commission and Parliament have been trying to harmonise or coordinate company law for over twenty years."
"The debate on the legal form of the European company has recently been re-kindled."
"The so-called Ciampi report stipulates that the lack of a statute for the European company results in considerable costs for the European economy."
"In the light of the study by the group on stimulating competitiveness in Europe the Commission is urging a speedy adoption of the statutes, preferably in 1997."
"Five years ago the Commission presented proposals for a European cooperative society, a European mutual society and a European association, in other words not only for the European joint-stock company."
"The reason why the Council of Ministers has failed to adopt various regulations on these kinds of company forms under European law is first and foremost because they could not agree on the essential directives on the position of employees."
"The most controversial issue was the idea of building in special employee representation in the company bodies, what we have with some works councils, for example: participation or co-determination are part of social democracy."
"They mean economic productivity at the same time."
"Only an informed, qualified, committed and motivated employee who has the opportunity to influence matters can develop forms of organisation and technologies and so use them in such a way that all opportunities for sustainable development are fully utilised."
"The main objective of the communication we are debating here today is to break the deadlock on the proposals on the European company forms and European legislation."
"The Commission's communication concentrates on whether and how the directive on European works councils can help here."
"It offers three options: the first is keeping the status quo, the second and third options are closely linked."
"Both are based on the assumption that the controversial matter of co-determination by company organs in the supervisory board or board of directors would not be pursued further and that the employee involvement directives would be withdrawn."
"The second option also proposes, in addition to the EWC Directive, a community instrument to create minimum standards for informing and consulting employees at the national level."
"I think this approach is important because it means that the European works council can operate more effectively."
"But this proposal does not constitute a contribution to economic co-determination."
"The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Social Affairs stipulates first of all that no European joint-stock company or other form of company can be created unless the EWC Directive is transposed."
"Unlike the Commission communication it distinguishes between pure information and consultation rights, as under the EWC, and the opportunities for economic participation, like those enjoyed by employees in the supervisory boards in Germany or the Netherlands or like those enjoyed in the Nordic countries of Finland and Sweden under collective agreement rights when company decisions are taken."
"It is with this in mind that my report calls secondly for opportunities for economic participation for employees."
"In view of the plethora of models in the European Union we must avoid two dangers."
"We must not transfer a specific codetermination model from a few Member States to the other countries of the Community, in other words no export of the mainly German model."
"But equally worker co-determination cannot be circumvented by means of a European legal instrument."
"We must prevent the frequently quoted flight from co-determination."
"This must be counteracted by minimum standards in European companies."
"Any Community initiative is based on the assumption that the existing rules on co-determination are familiar."
"We therefore welcome the creation of a group of experts from both sides of industry which will identify by means of a comparative study the legal and actual situation in the EU countries on information, consultation, participation and co-determination."
"It will also examine the role of the European works council under the general heading of codetermination."
"We hope that this group, which has already started work, will take the time to work out a definitive proposal."
"The results of this study must be presented for a social dialogue at the European level which can then decide on framework agreements on co-determination."
"Analogous agreements between both sides of industry might also be considered at the branch or company level."
"At all events we need a special yardstick for co-determination in all European joint-stock companies which corresponds to the relevant structures of the company or firm."
"The communication reports on why the directive on the EWC was so successful."
"That can be turned round any way one likes, the real secret of success of the EWC lies in certain procedural principles."
"They could also be very relevant in creating a co-determination model of a European joint-stock or other company."
"A European directive must lay down flexibility, negotiations solutions and minimum standards in the event that the social partners cannot reach agreement within a specific time."
"The suggestion in the recital that the European company statute should be made more attractive to small and medium-sized undertakings does not mean that there should be zones with no co-determination when employee numbers are low."
"That is not what the committee wants; we want to support these SMEs."
"May I briefly summarize the position of the Committee on Social Affairs: firstly, both sides of industry should play an appropriate role in establishing the rules on co-determination; secondly, employee participation in the European company must be more than information and consultation rights of the European works councils, under no condition should there be a European company without employee economic participation."
"The European model is called social market economy and employee participation and partnership are part and parcel of its basic principles."
"Participation and co-determination are important principles."
"In conclusion may I stress the importance of that last sentence and thank all members of the Committee on Social Affairs for their solid support and the Committees on Economic and Legal Affairs, whose opinions we fully endorse."
"Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Menrad, with whom I have worked for several years on this subject, and also my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, whose point of view I am representing today."
"I have worked closely with both Mr Rothley and Mr Janssen van Raay on the issue of information and consultation of workers in the European Company Statute."
"The conclusions of the Legal Affairs Committee were very largely similar to the conclusions of Mr Menrad."
"We had a vote in the committee which was nem con , showing the strength of feeling in the committee which is convinced that it is absolutely essential for the wellbeing of the internal market that we have information and consultation of workers in some form."
"Speaking particularly about the European Company Statute, this is an important plank of the internal market and it is absolutely vital that the Commission gets this proposal unblocked."
"We need a European Company Statute with the full participation of the workforce."
"It is quite unacceptable to press ahead with a company statute without British workers being fully involved."
"Indeed, back in Britain many British companies tell me they want the European Company Statute."
"It is a voluntary arrangement; it is not compulsory."
"Every single British company which decides to set up as a European company should do so and have the participation of British workers, so we do not want a European Company Statute with Britain a kind of second-class citizen again."
"As far as European Works Councils are concerned, they have some place."
"But if we look at the Commission's consultative document, it muddles up the options for information, consultation and participation."
"We need to build on the best traditions of company law in the whole of Europe."
"Germany has a fine tradition of workers on the board, France and other places have good versions too."
"We need to have a flexible system which is good for all the workers in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first and foremost I should perhaps convey to you my best and heartfelt wishes for a successful social year in 1997 and a happy outcome to the IGC."
"On behalf of the Group I compliment Mr Menrad most warmly on his report."
"It is a good report, ladies and gentlemen, and it contains a very powerful New Year message, Commissioner, to the European Commission."
"In the view of my Group that message is as follows."
"As Mrs Oddy said just now, we are all agreed on the need for progress on the various forms of European company, which have been blocked for years now. But on one thing we must be clear."
"We are not prepared either to make social concessions to the single market."
"That means, Commissioner, that if the Council and Commission want to press ahead on the matter of European companies - and I assume they will in 1997 - then for us that can only be possible if we also get definitive rules, not only on worker information and consultation, but also on worker participation."
"I think the European Parliament may hold an important key when these proposals come up for discussion, especially if they are made under Article 100a, and we are now serving notice to the Commission that we, the European Parliament, will not yield on the matter of these rules for worker participation."
"Already during the debate on the 1995-1996 social action programme Parliament pressed in Mr Hughes' report for all directives concerning worker participation which were currently blocked to be unblocked."
"We were very glad to see the Commission producing a communication for the benefit of the social partners."
"Well, Commissioner, I have to say with regret on behalf of my Group that we are somewhat disappointed in the Commission's communication."
"Firstly we are sorry that there was no debate beforehand with the social partners, that there has not been greater study of the different forms of worker participation which already exist in the Member States."
"We also think that the concrete options suggested in this statement are not satisfactory."
"Indeed we think that the European works council is a success."
"We are very happy that even firms in countries not bound by these rules have chosen to have European works councils."
"But we also think that worker involvement should not stop at the European works council."
"In smaller firms too there must be provision for information, consultation and participation."
"The Union must ensure that social dialogue is and remains an essential element in our European social model."
"Secondly, the issue of participation is not regulated either in the European works council or in the directive on collective redundancies or transfers of undertakings."
"And that is a subject which has been under discussion since the Vredeling directive."
"We think that in addition to the European works council there have to be rules which also prevent firms from shopping around to find the best country in which they can avoid trade union involvement in their operations."
"So, Commissioner, it is unacceptable to us that there should be a European company in a country which will not even agree to works councils."
"So the United Kingdom cannot be involved for the moment. But secondly, we also find it unacceptable to have a European company without far-reaching rules on participation."
"And then I would also ask the Commission and the Davignon Group too to think creatively this year about legislation which, firstly, will respect the tradition of social debate in the Member States."
"Which, secondly, devises framework legislation at European level on information, consultation and participation in smaller firms too, not to enable them to escape the process of dialogue but on the contrary to enable dialogue to exist within small businesses too."
"I shall thus be happy to support the EPP Group's Amendment No 2 on behalf of my own Group."
"Thirdly, legislation which leaves the specific shape and form of things to the social partners."
"Fourthly, which provides for minimum rules applicable to everyone."
"I think this will give us a piece of good legislation, Commissioner."
"Madam President, first may I congratulate you on the fact that you are chairing this debate and it is perhaps fitting that someone from Germany should preside over it, since Mr Menrad too has made an exceptional contribution in the drafting and presentation of his report."
"Because this is no simple matter; it concerns the very essence of codetermination in the various countries of Europe and thus the essence of the European social system."
"Our subject is of course the European company and the Commission is now trying to get this European company off the ground. For two reasons it has not yet managed to do so - firstly the question of codetermination and secondly the question of tax."
"We are very much in favour of it."
"But the machinery of codetermination is not suitably regulated and that is not good enough."
"We have a number of different systems here, and how is one to align those systems in such a way that one can distil a European company out of them?"
"It is not easy."
"It is not easy from the standpoint of a country like Germany, or one like the Netherlands, and certainly not from the standpoint of a country like Italy."
"The merit of this opinion is that it has drawn all the threads together."
"We have started along the road, we are going to resolve the problem and maybe finally get this European company sorted out."
"That is I think a very important point."
"But countries which do not have codetermination councils, European works councils, cannot really be a part of this."
"That is one thing. The second thing is that we must take account of the two main corporate systems in Europe, namely the monistic and the dualist systems, and we must find appropriate forms for them."
"They must be flexible forms but forms of equal value."
"Forms which are equal and thus do not lead to an erosion of codetermination but on the contrary to an enhancement of the European model."
"So, Commissioner, the European works council has made a significant contribution towards the further resolution of this problem."
"But it is also important that we should continue our efforts, as the opinion advocates, on codetermination in general."
"It is a slow process but it must be addressed."
"All these things taken together more or less boil down to what Mr Menrad proposes."
"Mr Menrad also stresses the importance, and rightly, of the expert committee headed by Mr Davignon."
"I am actually very glad we have produced this opinion before his committee has started work."
"I think they will find the opinion useful."
"The European People's Party attaches enormous importance to a European company."
"It is crazy that we have a European market but as yet no European company."
"This company has to be voluntary, but it must offer a basis for codetermination. Certainly it must not be a step backwards for countries which already have that system, but on the other hand it must not be an obstacle to countries which have not yet advanced quite so far along the road."
"I think Mr Menrad has made a good job of presenting the overall situation."
"I hope the Commission will take all the recommendations on board, because each one is important in its own way."
"Then we can perhaps get this initiative completed, but not before we have had a suitable response from the European Council and the European Commission to these excellent proposals of Mr Menrad's."
"Madam President, as we are all aware, the main objective of the report on the consultation of workers is to establish appropriate and up-to-date global rules governing the sector."
"Let us put on one side for a moment the first of the three options put forward by the Commission because it in fact proposes that the status quo be retained without change."
"But let us look more closely at the other two."
"As a group, we are in favour of the third option provided it does not depend on implementation of the second option."
"We need therefore to unhook the third from the second option which suggests a global approach based on the definition of a general framework."
"In contrast, the third option seems more closely to reflect the requirements of all of the interested parties, by referring back to the link with transposition of the directive on European Works Councils."
"We are in fact starting from the premiss that forms of worker information and consultation exist in all the Member States, based on the needs and special features of the individual state."
"In certain sectors, the adoption of Community rules of a general nature could therefore prejudice balances achieved with great difficulty over a period of time."
"The third option therefore seems to us to be based on realistic demands reflecting clearly-defined requirements."
"It is actually unfair to subject undertakings which opt for the new legal form of European company to comply with rules on workers different from those whose observance is required under Directive 94/45 for other companies at a Community level."
"We have the opportunity of taking an approach which meets the needs of both workers and undertakings."
"And it is our duty to do so."
"Madam President, I am going to use my time to read a text by Mr Ribeiro who cannot, unfortunately, be present."
"The subject of workers' participation in the system of social relations in which some people see ways of exploiting the labour force and others of a non-social combination of productive factors is one of the most interesting we can discuss."
"Either in terms of ideology or in terms of the practical and political expressions which might be used."
"Of course, it will not only be interesting for those who, belonging to one of those schools of thought or action, feel that they have the only way of thinking or have the only authority on the matter."
"However, for those people perhaps nothing is of interest and not even in terms of thought or action..."
"The Menrad report, in my opinion, reflects the complexity of this question in dealing with information and consulting workers."
"However, it is not innocuous and would be dangerous to identify information and consultation with participation."
"The report does not make clear this vital distinction and nor does it avoid the risks of that possible identification."
"To inform and to consult might become the antidote for real participation or an excuse for avoiding real participation at all."
"Affirming the right to information and consultation cannot, in my opinion, be a kind of co-responsibilisation of workers at a given time, given that when things are going well information and consultation are not necessary for doing business."
"I accept and support the claim of the principle of informing and consulting workers. Therefore I think that the Menrad report is positive especially in respect of multinational or transnational companies but I must, however, emphasize my reservation about the refusal to identify these actions with the participation and the co-responsibilisation of workers in management, especially since information and consultation could be used as an expedient so that workers are more ready to accept real measures taken against them during difficult economic times, dismantling systems and reversing social games."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Pronk talked about the European social model and the European system."
"I think we must look at that a little more critically."
"We are not here to limit ourselves to defending the status quo."
"It is true that there is no change without defence, defence against the neo-liberal attempts to seize territory."
"But it is equally true that attack is the best form of defence."
"We have the opportunity to design the European constitution as one of the basic levels for coordinating the Europeanisation and democratisation of the economy."
"That may sound presumptuous, too aggressive for some, too optimistic for others."
"But that is the real situation: the neo-liberal offensive in Europe especially is threatening and has started to reduce the effective existence of employees' chances to help shape affairs at the broader level."
"That is going too far."
"The least that we should decide here to do together is to reverse the current negative force of this process, and Mr Menrad's report is the first step in that process."
"But once the reverse force is under way we have no reason to bring it to a halt at the structure stage where it stopped in our national histories."
"We should ensure that we really make further progress along the lines of democratising the economy."
"If the people who propelled this neo-liberal dynamic force then start to complain, they only have themselves to blame."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done but also to ask him to forgive me if I tell him that I find some parts of his report a little obscure."
"Of course, there were difficulties in translation."
"And of course I handle social concepts with less facility than he does."
"However, I believe, to use the language of semantics, that some of the words used take on an extended meaning that becomes all the wider as any understanding of it becomes less well-defined."
"Apart from that, it would be advisable for the rapporteur to explain clearly what he means by 'co-determination' ."
"I fear that term does not cover the same situation in France and Germany."
"Let me now turn to a fundamental point."
"The rapporteur assigns trade unions a leading role in the life of firms."
"As you know, trade union history is in large measure that of a struggle between two ideas illuminated by different doctrines."
"One is the doctrine of a single trade union organization, as was the case in all socialist regimes, whether communist, fascist or Nazi, and the other is that of trade union pluralism enabling workers to form any unions they wish and to join the organization of their choice."
"In my country, France, the hypocrisy of the system enables us to maintain the illusion of trade union pluralism by guaranteeing in practice the preservation and privileges of the already established organizations which cling fiercely to those privileges."
"It is somewhat similar to the situation here in the European Parliament, where the system is really one of a single party with dual labelling and having two extremes with slightly divergent economic doctrines."
"Thus, in France, a law on 'trade union representativeness' forbids the free candidature of workers in the first round of professional elections of staff representatives or delegates to works councils, and it is only when there is a shortfall at the first round that the worker can vote or stand for an organization of his choice not yet recognized."
"Note that the French criteria for representativeness always include the patriotism shown during the years of occupation."
"It is difficult to see how organizations whose founders have not yet reached retirement age could satisfy this criterion."
"Not only that, but no mention is made of the fact that the communist leaders who controlled the French CGT with a rod of iron, according to the ninth and thirteenth directives of the 21 Moscow conditions, had supported the Hitler-Stalin pact and even, like the traitor Thorez, deserted from the French army straight away so as not to face the German army."
"But today, in the dishonourable, unscrupulous, disloyal war in my country against the national movement and patriotic forces fighting for the independence, sovereignty and freedoms of the fatherland, there is a desire to ban new trade union organizations whose members are workers who no longer have confidence in the old union nomenklatura, in the apparatchiks incapable of expressing the desires for work, with preference given to nationals, the desires for security, for self-management of wages, for setting up modern social security systems and retirement schemes that are appropriate, better managed and better controlled."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The European join-stock company may well facilitate the change towards the internal market if one considers the ever closer economic interrelationship of companies in Europe."
"The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has closely studied the Commission proposal, including an experts' hearing, and I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for resisting the pressure to produce an over-hasty conclusion."
"For indeed we need time to reflect on the repercussions of the statute of a small European joint-stock company on labour relations, on relations between owners, shareholders, management, the labour force, works councils and trades unions."
"We could, of course, have shown greater courage for co-determination and not for reduced participation, precisely because we were not under pressure of time."
"The vision of a democratic economy, which has also been addressed, would have been important precisely at this time of economic upheaval, in view of employees' fears at globalisation; it would have been a signal to the labour force that Europe also values more than just shareholders."
"If you will bear with me, Mr Menrad, I cannot refrain from pointing out a few inconsistencies."
"In paragraph 11 I am happy to see that you say there must be no flight from co-determination."
"But I as a German must point out that the German government in the last few years has taken two decisions which worsen employees' rights; one of them, for example, is the law on small companies dealing with co-determination rights in companies with fewer than 500 employees."
"That is why I am particularly worried about paragraph 14 of your report in which you made specific reference to this matter."
"We all know that most workers in Europe are employed in these small and medium-sized companies and I think that they are the ones who need special protection."
"And as you also know, Germany has also made works council rights worse for very small firms, for those with fewer than ten employees."
"In principle we welcome the study which you referred to in supportive terms."
"But we do expect that the results will not only be made available to representatives of the social dialogue but also of course to the European Parliament."
"I believe we should discuss our ideas on a future European directive and European company statute in detail and without pressure of time."
"I urge that we keep national traditions but at the same time advance democracy in the world of work at the European level."
"We are unfortunately still far removed from that objective on the threshold of the next century."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Menrad, very warmly."
"He has brought his wide experience, his deep knowledge, his perspicacity and attention to detail to this report."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for their preliminary work, even if the communication on worker information and consultation is not exactly a success story, but that is not the Commission's fault."
"Apart from the various directives on mass redundancy, the transfer of companies and the European works council which were individual successes, all other proposals have ground to a halt in the Council."
"That is particularly true of the co-determination model."
"The Council has not exactly excelled itself by its eagerness to take decisions, and it is time that that was made public and that the people of Europe learn exactly where matters have become stuck: not in the European Parliament, not in the Commission but in the Council."
"The Commission's four principles for solving this problem sound good: to wit, simplification, coherence, pragmatic and planned progress and general application."
"But as to whether the three solutions proposed will be successful - keeping the status quo, global approach, proposals on the statute of the European company, European association or European mutual society - I am doubtful, Commissioner."
"I am also afraid that we shall need some more time to find the solution to this problem, to get in all the opinions which have been requested and to see the Commission's definitive document on the table before us."
"The experts' hearing on this subject in the Social Affairs Committee gave us a taste of the difficulties ahead in the search for a solution to the problem of informing and consulting employees."
"The Commission's group of experts, as I have unfortunately had occasion to say to you, Commissioner, is composed of theoreticians and too few practitioners."
"I also think the deadlines set for this expert group on such a complex subject are too tight."
"Here I agree with Mr Menrad."
"I fully endorse the broad conclusions which the rapporteur has already reiterated."
"I would just like to draw attention to a sentence where he writes: variant 3(a) would be most acceptable in combination with option 2."
"Mr President, good industrial relations, with a well-developed relationship between the owners of a company and the management on the one side and the employed and the unions on the other is an asset for all concerned."
"The Commission is proposing three different alternatives at EU level: to maintain the current situation, to establish a framework or to go straight to a proposal for a Regulation on European companies."
"The committee supports the development of a framework, which seems to be a sensible and realistic measure, and the proposal to establish a Directive on the minimum level of information to, and consultation, with employees."
"It is very important that this does involve a minimum of regulations and not a full harmonisation of legislation."
"Each Member State must be able to maintain and develop its own regulations which may be more far reaching than the framework and the minimum requirements."
"There are also large discrepancies between Member States."
"In Sweden there is already a well developed system of participation through collective agreements which has proved to work well."
"Above all, issues of this nature ought to be resolved and administered by the labour market and related parties."
"Any proposals for legislation and directives ought therefore to be developed in close conjunction with the relevant parties in the labour market."
"This proposal, Mr President, should be seen as a first step towards more far reaching employee influence at EU level as well."
"Mr President, Commissioner. perhaps note should be taken of the paradox that a communication on worker participation, consultation and information has been produced without consulting the social partners."
"To me that is a paradox."
"Secondly I want to mention the deadlock in the Council - I suppose the communication from the Commission is intended to break that deadlock - as regards those aspects of the statutes of companies, associations, cooperatives and mutual societies that have to do with worker information, consultation and participation."
"In our view this deadlock raises two questions: one - already discussed here on many occasions - is the need for qualified majority rather than unanimous decision procedure, particularly on the social issues we are so concerned about, at least in our group."
"We think the Commission's three proposals are broadly unacceptable unless they are changed and we naturally agree with the rapporteur that there should be a group of experts which includes trade unionists, SMEs, scientists, Parliament and the Commission, to give us a clear idea and a clear proposal for a directive guaranteeing worker consultation, information and participation once and for all."
"Because, we repeat, the Europe some of us want will not exist if worker and citizen participation is not turned into reality."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Menrad on his splendid report."
"It is great to have a German Conservative I can agree with, even if I cannot agree with my British Conservative colleagues."
"It is nice to see someone like him involved in dealing with the social area so that real progress can be made in this Parliament."
"Unfortunately, we do not get that kind of progress inside the Council of Ministers and I know very well why that is so."
"Firstly, it is only right and essential, when you have a statute for a European company, that you also have the active promotion of the participatory, consultative processes within that company for workers."
"It is further right that this report identifies the fact that we need to promote this progress both positively and earnestly."
"The Directive on European Works Councils after all is rather too limiting for any progress to be made."
"I must say to Mrs Van Lancker that the social debate in the United Kingdom is not entirely dead."
"I was the editor of a pamphlet in the '80s which spoke about the pan-European agreements that were being forged vis-√†-vis the participatory democratic relationships inside companies."
"I was very pleased then that companies in the United Kingdom had taken a very positive lead in that."
"But, unfortunately, the United Kingdom, as you know, is controlled by what we might refer to as the political undead."
"I hope that one day we will be able to do without them."
"But we must remember that inside the United Kingdom people have lost their jobs and their homes and they cannot afford to lose their hope in this respect and I know that you will join me when we try to do something about that."
"This report clearly demonstrates that conflict can be avoided inside companies."
"If there is anything that could demonstrate the proof of this and its relevance to our society, and indeed to the world as a whole, we must look to Seoul in Korea to see just how trade union rights are being taken away from workers with the horrendous violence which is being seen on the streets there."
"It is quite obvious that this is some proof of what we can do."
"Paying respect to this particular report is easy because it looks at the differing forms of economic units as well - the mutual societies, the cooperatives, the SMUs - and this is all essential if we are to have the kind of success which we know is relevant for the progress of this report."
"In conclusion, therefore, I just wish to say how grateful I am to our colleague, Mr Menrad, for all the work he has done on this and I hope that we can promote this through the Commission and the Council as rapidly as possible so that it becomes law."
"Mr President, I come from a country, Greece, which can claim no great traditions or achievements in the area of informing, consulting with and encouraging the participation of working people, and for that reason, if you will, from another standpoint, we note developments at the European level with particular interest."
"Here, of course, we should express threefold concern, as I believe has been confirmed by other speakers too."
"The first concern is that there is unfortunately this two-speed development in the European Union, one speed for monetary issues and a different speed for issues related to working peoples' rights, and that is why we have been bogged down for decades over the issues of information, participation and consultation."
"The second concern is the probable danger that instead of making it easier for countries with no great achievements to forge ahead, we may hold back and drag down achievements that already exist in other European Union countries."
"The third concern is that we may end up with laws so labyrinthine, fragmented and technical, that working people will ultimately be largely excluded."
"And I am afraid that this is confirmed by the existence of too many regulations and by the fact that all these debates are taking place largely beyond the range of the labour and unionist movement's monitoring capabilities."
"In this situation, I want to say that I too think Mr Menrad has produced excellent work and that proposals such as the ones about the European Company, the Committee of Experts, a directive characterized by flexibility and a high-level common denominator, are extremely important."
"Mr President, this report highlights the need to make progress on working out a participation model in the question of informing and consulting employees in the co-determination process."
"Flexibility, pragmatic negotiation solutions and the introduction of necessary minimum standards will play a major role in this in view of the present very different European systems."
"At a time when questions of the single market and globalisation reveal the most different framework conditions to be met by employees, acceptable framework regulations are even more necessary than ever."
"Today's international economy shows ruthlessly how capital moves and is concentrated, how it vanishes, what it exploits and who becomes the pawn of this new flexibility."
"The biggest problem here is that in these international processes, in these international mechanisms basic human and trade union rights are circumvented and infringed."
"In this context we must also think beyond the frontiers of Europe."
"We must do that in order to see more clearly."
"I know full well that we cannot regulate everything, nor indeed try to do so."
"But a harmonious social community demands democratic consultation and co-determination models when the existential substance of individual workers is at stake, because in the final analysis it is on that that the plurality of our society and the creation of our democratic system depends."
"The lack of a European company statute which, for example provides for stronger involvement of employees, means a waste of resources on both sides and leads of course to considerable costs on the economic side."
"That is something we must constantly bear in mind."
"It is precisely in that context that we must reiterate that the lack of a European company statute must be regarded as a deficiency because in my opinion such a statute could also provide the incentive for investments and so employment."
"The Commission's expert group which is charged with preparing recommendations for co-determination models by April must not be allowed to remain solely a platform for debate but should also give the necessary impetus for action."
"Here it is important that the European solution adopted does not allow any escape for any company from countries with stricter regulations."
"Otherwise we would only need to start talking about de-regulation downwards and that surely cannot be the credo of our action."
"To sum up, the Menrad report in my view contains reasonable proposals on how the objective of co-determination can be reached and it also points out the risks of inaction in this matter."
"A refusal to have co-determination is the most expensive wrong investment for the economy."
"That is something we must never forget."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you and your colleagues in the European Parliament for the excellent way you have addressed the Commission communication of 14 November on worker information and consultation."
"I believe the motion for a resolution which we are discussing and which you are going to vote on, as well as its explanatory statement, illustrates very clearly the careful attention you have all paid to this very important subject."
"This applies especially to Mr Menrad who has made quite a decisive contribution to the settlement of some previous dossiers, such as the European Works Councils."
"We all want to acknowledge that."
"I thank you in particular for the great efforts you are making once again with this excellent own-initiative report, trying to help out the European institutions in this important matter."
"As Mr Menrad emphasizes in his report, the Commission communication addresses two main subjects."
"The first is the need for a Community level framework for information and consultation in national undertakings."
"The second concerns the attempt to break the deadlock regarding the European Company Statute and a number of other related proposals, all of which are pending and are important in the fulfilment of the internal market."
"Regarding the first issue, I very much welcome the positive approach which you have adopted."
"In the light of the consultations which have followed the Commission's communication, I shall be presenting to the Commission in the coming months a proposal to initiate the procedure for the consultation of the social partners at European level."
"I very much hope that the social partners will be willing and able to identify the content of the rules which should apply here and to reach an agreement on how these rules will be put in place."
"The second issue raised in the communication is very complex as illustrated by the fact that the Commission is seeking to break a deadlock which has existed for more than a quarter of a century."
"This deadlock deprives European industry of a very valuable instrument - the European Company Statute - which would be extremely useful in helping industry to adapt to the new single market conditions and to become more competitive worldwide."
"The imminence of the third phase of economic and monetary union now reinforces the urgent need to make this instrument available."
"The European Council is well aware of the urgent need to make progress on this matter and, indeed, has reaffirmed its commitment to do just that as recently as last June at its meeting in Florence."
"If, as I hope, Mr Menrad's report is adopted by the European Parliament you will be making a decisive contribution towards identifying the constructive solutions which are required and I very much welcome the fact that you agree with the Commission on the basic precondition for progress that has to be made in this matter, and that is on the need to find an adequate set of rules applicable to the European company which preserve national systems while at the same time avoiding imposing foreign models of worker involvement in individual Member States."
"Today I am pleased to say this represents common ground but you have not restricted yourselves to merely restating this basic position."
"Mr Menrad's paper goes much further and analyses in depth a number of ways in which this approach could be put into effect."
"You have put forward many innovative ideas which will be of very great help to us in trying to find a way out of the present difficulties."
"There are many difficulties to be overcome as has been stated by many of the contributors to the debate."
"As you know, the Commission has recently established a high level group of independent experts chaired by Mr Davignon."
"This expert group is an additional forum for reflection and will be an extra source of ideas on this issue."
"I understand that there will be a delegation from the European Parliament including Mr Menrad which will be meeting the members of this group in the very near future."
"I urge you to discuss your ideas, which are articulated in the report, with the expert group."
"I am sure it will be very useful and an important input to their work."
"On the basis of all the contributions received by the Commission on its communication as well as the report from the expert group, I am looking forward to coming back to you on behalf of the Commission and to the other Community institutions."
"My aim is to have concrete solutions capable of gathering the support required for the conclusion of this long-standing debate."
"Ms Oddy put it very well when she said that Europe needs the European company."
"It is a very important matter for the perfection of the internal market."
"I agree."
"Mr Pronk recognized very clearly that there are many different systems in existence throughout the Community and it will not be easy to bring them all together."
"I would like to look forward to having a system which would be both useful and flexible for all those wishing to use it, so that it could enjoy the confidence both of business and commerce and also respect the need for appropriate involvement of workers."
"The European company has always been necessary for the internal market."
"With the advent of EMU and the single currency, it will not just be necessary but essential."
"To Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez I would say on consultation that the Commission's communication was a consultative document and it seemed to me to be much more appropriate to put our ideas up front first rather than consult people in advance of putting the consultation document into play."
"There will be very wide consultation as a consequence of all we have now done."
"Finally, we have been trying to achieve this for twenty-six years."
"It was first brought up in 1970 but I would remind the House that even before that Robert Schuman spoke of the urgent need for achieving the market of having such an instrument."
"After all these years we are now arriving at the possibility of a solution which has evaded the Union for so many years."
"Other matters have been put in place and have been helped by the House, in particular the European Works Council, so that we can now look forward to a solution here as well."
"After all those years I remain optimistic."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Protection of forests"
"The next item is the report (A4-0417/96) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposals for Council Regulations amending:"
"I. Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution (COM(96)0341 - C4-0476/96-96/0185(CNS));"
"II.Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 on protection of the Community's forests against fire (COM(96)0341 - C40477/96-96/0186(CNS))."
"Mr President, I was relying on the Commissioner making a long speech."
"Usually you can rely on these things, but the very time I wanted him to make a long speech, he cut it short."
"It is quite terrible!"
"I shall send you a message in future: ' Do not worry, make a long speech' , I shall say."
"I apologise for my absence, but the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection was being reconstituted."
"Now that it is reconstituted I can tell you about this report."
"In fact, it is completely uncontroversial."
"The committee has examined the Commission's two proposals: one, on the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and the other on forest fires."
"We have looked at these and think that they are laudable."
"They are contributions to sustainable forestry."
"They build on existing programmes and simply bring them up-to-date."
"They extend the life of the programmes and make the necessary budgetary changes."
"We had one problem with the Commission and that was the way in which it presented the budgetary provisions."
"The Commission wanted to include the budgetary provisions in the proposals."
"That is contrary to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1995 and so, on examining the two proposals the Budget Committee made some amendments."
"It is the view of the Environment Committee that the Budget Committee's amendments should be accepted: they substitute advisory committees for management committees, thus making the whole thing more open and, I hesitate to say above-board, but at least transparent."
"The Budget Committee also pointed out that we need to have mid-term assessment of cost-effectiveness and implementation performance."
"Again, the Environment Committee thought that that was a wise suggestion."
"We are therefore prepared to recommend acceptance of the Budget Committee amendments."
"When we voted I recommended the inclusion of these amendments and the committee has followed that advice."
"We think, as a committee, that these reports will make a very large difference to European Union forestry policy and they will continue existing, successful programmes."
"They have cross-party and inter-committee support."
"Therefore I, like the Commissioner before me, do not need to make a very long speech."
"I can finish at this point because nobody has sent me a message to ask me to speak any longer!"
"I recommend that Parliament accept these reports."
"Mr President, we have here one of those proposals which we simply have to approve, among other things because it restates principles - already set out in 1986 and then retabled in 1992 - which we are now updating for a further five years."
"At a time when we are proposing that the European Union make a new economic and organizational effort, it might be appropriate to consider the results of these ten years of experiment and commitment."
"As regards the first problem, the problem of pollution, a specialist report tells us that, between 1988 and the present, European forests have suffered continuing and progressive impoverishment as a result of the corrosive effect of atmospheric pollution: defoliation, decoloration and the extinction of the more vulnerable plant species stimulate us to make a greater effort in the area of scientific research, giving it priority over monitoring and cataloguing, the procedures and criteria for which ought, in our view, to be firmly established ten years on."
"The issue of protection against fire is a different and more complex one."
"The study tells us that almost half of Europe's forests are at risk of fire: 400, 000 fires were officially recorded between 1985 and 1995, but is possible that there were many more."
"All of them are caused, one way or another, by man."
"The main culprit is carelessness on the part of those who frequent forests to work or hunt or for recreational purposes; the second is inadequate maintenance of agricultural land bordering on forest, with unmown grassland resulting in a lethal deposit of highly-flammable hay; the third - and perhaps the most - critical cause is crime."
"Aside from the fires started by those who are unbalanced in one way or another, there are throughout Europe criminal organizations which start fires in order to benefit from the financial incentives provided for extinguishing fires and for reafforestation."
"On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, Mr President, Commissioner, I think that we should set under way studies and inquiries on that issue in particular, before agreeing to any proposals - what we need then are initiatives able to identify those proposals that are objectively valid."
"Finally, the resources are very limited: ECU 70 m for fighting fires."
"That is very little if we really want to make more progress."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Thomas debated this evening states that the forests have deteriorated by 3.8 % compared with the previous year."
"So that adds another 3.8 % to the 27 % of European trees that were already in trouble."
"Hence the need to approve these regulations and the funds to help implement them, expressed by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment."
"As he said, there was no great problem approving this report on the regulations and funds."
"However, perhaps remembering the debate this evening, the substantial differences between the various countries in terms of a Community policy to support the forestry sector need to be made clear, and the Committee on the Environment tried to achieve that on several occasions."
"Certainly there are difficulties, because there is diversity of forests, diversity in the way different countries deal with them, but if the European Union is to comply with the various conventions it has signed - Rio Conference, Helsinki Conference and also the Vth Environmental Action Programme - it is essential not only to implement these regulations, but also, after discussions between the various countries and the European Union, to achieve a common policy to protect our forests."
"Otherwise it will not be possible to implement the 'Habitats' directive properly by the year 2000."
"Mr President, atmospheric pollution is no respecter of national boundaries, that much is obvious."
"The problems of Scandinavia's forests are a clear demonstration of the fact."
"I thus think that European cofinancing of research into the quality of the forests is a good thing."
"The regulation we are looking at here has been several years in the making and the results of the research are gradually becoming known."
"I have been looking through the findings published in the summary report of 1996."
"One of the thing which struck me was that the data show that it is excessive dryness, rather than air pollution, which damages the forests."
"And then we are talking about a specific region, the region around the Mediterranean."
"That is a remarkable finding."
"But it does not mean that air pollution does not play a part too."
"A quarter of trees were found to have lost a considerable proportion of their needles or leaves."
"So the research has so far yielded all this and it would seem a good idea to extend it."
"Now most of the money is already going not into observation via the systematic network, but into model and demonstration projects."
"I can understand that shift, though I do think we should consider reducing the level of European support once the new five-year period is up."
"The provision of aid always carries the risk that it will just be tacitly extended each time, when we ought to be wondering if the research objective has not in fact been achieved."
"It would seem that five years of research will yield enough data to enable conclusions to be drawn."
"I would then find it logical, on the basis of the research findings, to switch the funding to the routine protection of forests, that is to say to measures to counter air pollution and its effects on the soils and measures to counter desiccation."
"We shall of course have to consider all that nearer the time, but what worries me is that all too often more and more new research objectives are mooted in order to secure the flow of funding."
"In my view this applies even more to the regulation on forest fires."
"To conclude, Mr President, I am happy to support most of the amendments."
"Mr President, first of all I want to express the support of my group, the European People's Party, for this proposal from the Commission to extend the two forest protection programmes in their dual role of prevention of atmospheric contamination and protection against fire."
"These programmes can be generally felt to have been effective and Community coordination and evaluation of these two general phenomena continue to be necessary."
"But questions need to be put to the Commission, and some suggestions may also be in order."
"The atmospheric contamination protection programme is often thought to have been positive in its dual aims of establishing a general forest observation network - already covering the whole of the territory of the European Union and according to Commission reports, now operational - and an intensive monitoring network."
"The Commission has also presented us with data on over 200 pilot schemes developed, approved and financed."
"But we are told virtually nothing about the final objective and the evaluation of these programmes which have been developed over 10 years, and one of the European Commission's responsibilities is precisely to make the final evaluation of all these research programmes, which are focused on establishing whether or not there is a causal relationship between atmospheric contamination and the damage being observed in the forests."
"After 10 years of research throughout Europe, with the full collaboration of national research and international programmes, it is a little perplexing to find that there is still no data for evaluating and establishing cause and effect and, above all, procedures for looking after forests and forest floors."
"The Commission should be asked to deepen this evaluation and, if new research programmes are needed, they must be carried out."
"We cannot go on observing the deterioration of the forests, providing statistics and taking no measures."
"The impetus for the fire protection programme and the evaluation carried out in all the European Union countries has been positive, especially in the most affected, like Spain, Portugal, Italy and France and, in part, Germany too."
"But greater effort and cooperation between the Member States is still needed, because although there has been a reduction in the area burned, the number of forest fires has actually doubled since 1986, and there are days - this statistic ought to be on the front page of the newspapers - when two fires break out every minute in Europe."
"This really does not make sense and there are no supernatural causes."
"The phenomenon clearly involves criminal acts and negligence by the authorities, because an additional statistic is that 50 % of the causes of these fires remain unknown."
"Member States should be told that if they want to go on receiving Community aid, they must intensify their vigilance and especially their research."
"And, in the southern countries, the Member States must give local communities and councils greater responsibility for protecting the forests around them."
"I think that is an essential tool of effective protection."
"Mr President, I too agree with the furtherance of this extension of programmes related to the protection of forests from atmospheric pollution and fires."
"This is certainly a positive action by the Commission, and I agree with all that the rapporteur Mr Collins said."
"Here, of course, we should bear in mind that in recent years the continuing destruction of forests by fire, especially in the South, has assumed uncontrolled proportions and of course, from that point of view, nobody can absolve the administrations of the Member States from blame."
"I think, however, and we saw the same thing this morning in the Thomas report, that the European Union is doing far less than it could, both about protection and about improving the infrastructure, encouraging technical cooperation between the Member States, educating the workforce, and even setting up a task force for the entire European Union, which could contribute to the control of fires."
"I do not think this closes the subject, it is simply an opportunity for us to observe, now that it is still winter and not yet summer, that the issue is still open and requires much greater readiness to intervene and to support the European Union's action."
"Mr President, I am pleased that, in spite of everything - since there was some doubt whether there would be any at all - we are having a report and debate on these important matters."
"However, we have to recognize that the sums provided for funding these five-year programmes are very small."
"It is a hopeful sign that the amount proposed to deal with pollution is up on the previous period, but it is surprising that the grant for fire protection was not increased."
"The number of fires in Europe is tending to increase considerably."
"That in itself would justify an increase in the modest grant of ECU 70 million over five years, i.e. ECU 14 million per annum, particularly as it would be funding preventive measures."
"For it is noticeable that, although the number of fires increases at places where preventive work has been carried out, they are considerably smaller: the affected areas are then also much smaller."
"Moreover, providing funds for prevention reduces by as much the considerable cost of reafforestation."
"An appreciable saving is made in this way."
"That is why, on behalf of the PPE Group, I tabled Amendment No 20, identical with that of Mr Weber, seeking to increase the grant relating to forest fires from ECU 70 million to ECU 100 million which is still an eminently reasonable sum since, over five years, it amounts to ECU 20 million per year."
"So on behalf of my group, I ask you, Mr Rapporteur, to be willing to accept this amendment."
"I ask Parliament to adopt it and the Commission to take it over."
"Mr President, today Parliament has been giving very serious attention to the problems of our forests, which cover 41.5 % of the agricultural land of Member States, two thirds of which are happily private property."
"I would be preaching here to the converted if I were to repeat what was also rightly stressed in the debate on the Thomas report concerning the multiple role played by European forests in the environmental, health and leisure fields but also in social and economic areas."
"A good European Union forestry policy must not ignore the spirit of principle of subsidiarity: as little Community regulation as possible, limited to what is necessary."
"Using European resources to protect forests against atmospheric pollution that ignores frontiers and protecting Community forests against fires are Community activities that are worth strengthening and continuing."
"It is therefore important that we are given the resources for this policy, particularly as regards the protection of forests against fires."
"I therefore call urgently for the adoption of the amendment from our group, presented by my colleague, Mr de Br√©mond d'Ars, which seeks to increase the amount of Community funding set aside for implementing the necessary action."
"Having been able to appreciate, both in my own country and in the Community generally, the role played by foresters and their professional organizations in the context of good forestry management and fire protection, I am particularly anxious that they should participate effectively in Community action for the protection of forests and I hope the Commission can reassure us on this point."
"As vice-chairman of the Hunting, Fishing and Environmental Intergroup of this Parliament, I would also like to stress the outstanding part played by hunters and their organizations in protecting forests and wild life habitats, a part that is too often misunderstood in some sections of this Parliament."
"Hunters' organizations must also be full partners in the implementation of Community measures designed to protect our forests."
"So do not forget them, Commissioner."
"Mr President, although aware of the absolute need to put into effect strict preventive measures and effective rules to combat atmospheric pollution, our society is nevertheless revealing itself to be hidebound and inclined to inflict damage on itself."
"Not even the Commission has been able to reverse this trend and secure a real understanding of the need to protect the environment and the health of citizens. It revealed its own limitations when it failed to propose adequate financial support."
"In point of fact, this is totally inadequate compared with the problem of safeguarding forests and preventing the fires which play so great a part in their destruction."
"The damage caused to forests largely results from: the atmospheric pollution caused by the major industrial complexes; the change in weather conditions brought about by this disruption to natural balances which has devastating consequences, triggering processes of degradation, such as defoliation and foliage decoloration; and fires - both fires that result from natural causes and those which are the result of human stupidity."
"Community action will have, therefore, firstly, to seek to harmonize the efforts of the Member States to prevent this problem, which principally affects the southern states of the Union where fires have resulted in the destruction of more than 500, 000 hectares of forest."
"If we then consider the funding allocated to the two programmes on forest protection, during the first five years of their application, and note that the available resources have been practically exhausted, it is clear just how inadequate that funding is."
"We are therefore asking, on the one hand, for the Commission to identify those areas particularly at risk and make them the main target of Community aid and, on the other, for the Member States to submit global fire protection programmes. The latter must not be general, that is not particularly detailed, programmes; they must be specific and as clear as possible."
"We are absolutely convinced of the importance of creating a fire monitoring and information system for the Community as a whole and support the request of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection that the management committee originally provided for should be replaced with consultative committees which, if nothing else, would help limit the influence of the Council and strengthen the role of the European Parliament."
"First of all I should like to express the Commission's thanks to you, Mr Collins, rapporteur, and the Members of your committee for the quality of their work."
"I would also like to stress the importance of the analysis in the reports from the Budget and Agricultural Committees and their respective rapporteurs also."
"They have all taken a very positive stance on the protection of the Union's forestry resources and the continuation of the Community measures in that sector."
"It is very clear both from the Thomas report this morning and this afternoon that the protection and maintenance of forests is an extremely important topic."
"It is widely debated throughout the world, particularly in view of the significant role of forests in combating desertification, climate changes and in the preservation of biodiversity."
"By signing the Rio Declaration, the Union formally undertook to help in the conservation, development and sustainable management of forests, whether in its own territory or elsewhere."
"The Sustainable Development Commission, with its governmental panel on forests, and the Helsinki Conference of Ministers on the protection of forests in Europe are the result of that undertaking."
"The two forest protection measures referred to by Mr Collins that we are now proposing to extend are the key elements in the conservation of Europe's forests."
"Their importance is underlined by the fact that about a quarter of our forests are showing reduced vitality and half-a-million hectares are devastated by fire each particular year."
"I would like to say to Mr Valverde L√≥pez that there has been quite some success to date when you consider the statistic that in ten years there have only been ten days without a forest fire, with 95 % of all the forest fires taken care of and controlled within ten minutes of starting."
"A lot of good work has been done there."
"We should recognize that."
"You have all expressed your broad agreement with the extension and the strengthening of these two important measures."
"For that I want to thank you."
"I also understand that you have proposed a number of amendments."
"Several of these are common to both regulations."
"With regard to the legal basis - Amendments Nos 9 and 1 - I can understand your concern that the two measures should have separate legal bases as was previously the case."
"But nonetheless the Commission considers that Article 43 is both appropriate and sufficient and is not disposed to amend the legal base at this time."
"You have also quite rightly noted that there is a new formula for estimating the amounts needed to be stated in the two new proposals for regulations, that is, Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 16."
"This is, in particular, what Mr Collins referred to."
"We had quite mistakenly failed to take account of that change."
"This omission was also pointed out by the Council's working parties."
"The wording of the two regulations has been revised accordingly in the light of the precise wording of the March 1995 Interinstitutional Agreement referred to by the rapporteur, between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The amendments that you have requested in the committee procedure - Amendments Nos 5, 6, 14 and 15 - refer primarily to the publication of discussions within committees."
"As you will know, this matter has since been settled by agreement between Parliament and the Commission and redrafting of the legal texts is not longer required."
"You then ask for the Standing Forestry Committee to be changed into an advisory committee."
"But in practice the committee already acts in an advisory role in most cases."
"So I do not think that such a change should be part of this simple extension which is being sought today."
"I would make the point about the amendments concerning the mid-term assessment, Amendments Nos 8 and 17, that periodical evaluation reports on measures are published regularly, particularly with regard to forest health status and details on forest fires."
"The Commission will ensure that these reports are made available to the honourable Members by means of a more appropriate information process."
"The atmospheric pollution matter was referred to in four amendments, that is, Amendments Nos 22, 25, 26 and 28."
"They are of particular interest."
"However, we should remember that this is simply an extension of an action whose systems are already established at national, Community and international levels."
"So it is difficult therefore for the Commission to agree to those requests at this present time."
"For the protection of forests against fire, several amendments, Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 23, ask for the financing of prevention measures to be made conditional on immediate replanting after fires and also to provide for the financing of insurance for that replanting."
"These are measures which are not directly linked to the action and they would, I suggest, be very cumbersome."
"In addition, some experts have stated that they would not always be desirable or technically feasible."
"The Commission notes with much interest that there are amendments asking for an increase in the amount allocated to that action, that is, Amendments Nos 20, 24 and 27, which were particularly mentioned by Mr de Br√©mond d'Ars."
"We would like that to happen also."
"Unfortunately I am afraid such an increase does not appear a realistic proposition at this time given the current budgetary situation."
"Lastly, the Commission would like to welcome the amendments concerning the vital role of the rural population in the prevention of forest fires."
"Perhaps this refers to what Mrs Lulling was saying as well: Amendments Nos 11 and 21."
"This is a subject that we take very seriously."
"Within the Standing Forestry Committee we are cooperating closely with professional agricultural and forestry bodies to study the causes of fires and improve the protection measures generally. Accordingly we accept these amendments with some pleasure."
"I would once more like to thank the rapporteurs."
"Thank you, Mr Collins, and the Members of your committee for their very great efforts and their continuing concern for the protection of this great resource of Europe and of forest resources generally, which we will be passing on to future generations."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Application of customs and agricultural law"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Theato (A4-0303/96) on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the change of the legal basis of the proposal for a Council Regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (COM(93)0350 and COM(94)34-4324/95 - C4-0212/95-00/0450(COD))."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The proposal for a regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities in customs and agricultural matters has already trod a long and weary path."
"Unfortunately there is not yet any sign of a speedy solution."
"The conflict with the Council on the legal base to be applied has not been resolved."
"May I briefly remind you of the background."
"In December 1993 the European Parliament, under the co-decision procedure in Article 189b of the EEC Treaty, adopted a legislative opinion on the proposal for a regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities and the creation of a customs information system, CIS for short."
"Thereupon the Commission presented an amended proposal which incorporated most of Parliament amendments."
"In December 1994 the Council adopted not a common position but a political stance in which it invalidated the legal base of Article 100a proposed by the Commission and replaced it with Article 235 together with Article 43."
"That is how co-decision was turned into a simple consultation of Parliament, and it was done by a unilateral decision of the Council, with an abstention from one Member State."
"This unilateral behaviour is unacceptable to us."
"Parliament now has formally to adopt an opinion on two questions."
"Firstly: is Article 235 justified as a legal base?"
"Secondly: is the legal base significant only in procedural terms or also in substantive terms?"
"On question 1, the Council argues that the customs information system contained in the proposal for a regulation constitutes an integral community entity which does not relate to the harmonisation of individual national legislation for the internal market provided for by Article 100a."
"Why, I would like to know, did neither Commission nor Council think of separating the CIS from the rest of the proposal in order to deal with it directly under Article 235?"
"There were informal talks here with the rapporteur."
"The real regulation on the introduction and development of mutual assistance, as I explained before to the House and therefore do not need to repeat today, creates a regulatory environment allowing mutual assistance to be activated and to operate in relations between the Member States and with the Commission."
"This is clearly confirmed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Civil Liberties in its excellent opinion."
"I am very grateful to Mrs Palacio, who drafted the opinion, for stressing that in her accompanying opinion."
"As both national and community norms are mainly involved, this is undoubted harmonisation and therefore subject to Article 100a. A ruling from the European Court of Justice stipulates that a decision cannot be based on several legal bases which prescribe different procedures: Article 235 - consultation and unanimity in the Council, Article 43 - consultation of Parliament and qualified majority in the Council, Article 100a co-decision of Parliament and qualified majority in the Council."
"Furthermore the ruling states that the procedure which can strengthen Parliament's participation in legislation takes precedence."
"That brings us back again to Article 100a. Incidentally it is not only the legal service of the Commission but also that of the Council that confirms the correctness of Article 100a."
"On question 2, the substantive significance of the legal base."
"The Council accepts five amendments from Parliament, either verbatim or in essence, in its political stance."
"But other basic amendments made by the Commission in its modified proposal were ignored by the Council."
"Instead the Council said that information may only be passed on between administrative authorities once individual authorization has been granted by the judicial authorities."
"That can mean delay or even obstruction."
"In addition essential data in the CIS is omitted."
"This is of particular importance for transit traffic which we are dealing with in the sub-committee; the results of this should be available soon."
"The Council plans to exclude mutual assistance not only in restrictions of public order but also in other basic interests of the Member States."
"That is, excuse me, an elastic clause."
"The Council has also made many amendments to the Commission's text."
"It questions the equal value of findings by an authority in another Member State."
"In Article 43 the advisory committee is replaced by a type 3B regulatory committee. What inconsistency the Council is guilty of!"
"On the one hand there should be an integral community entity under Article 235, on the other hand it should be subjected to cumbersome national procedures."
"Four countries, namely Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden want to opt out from the regulation on non-automatic data processing."
"In other words, √† la carte."
"I conclude that on the matter of substance the proposal for a regulation also calls for co-decision, especially after the textual amendments made by the Council."
"I specifically ask the Commission - and I know, Commissioner Bonino, that you will take a view now - to clarify the statement that you, i.e. the Commission, added to the Council minutes in which the Commission expressed its regret at the modification to the legal base and reserved the right to avail of suitable legal means, and I ask which means."
"Thank you for your attention and I urge the House to approve the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that at least the Council is present."
"Behind the legal cloak of an issue concerning Articles 235 and 100a, the real issue is of high political significance."
"It is the clear indication of a lack of political will by the Council of Ministers to have the heart of a Community structure function properly."
"We are just about to adopt a report from the committee of inquiry into the Community transit system."
"That committee of inquiry came to the conclusion that what is at the heart of our common internal tariff is fraud-prone and error-prone."
"There is a lack of statistics and a lack of clarity in the application of the common customs tariff."
"This Community structure is a scandal."
"What is the Council's reply to this?"
"The Council's reply is to invoke spurious legal arguments to maintain the semblance of national sovereignty rather than having a strong internal market structured to apply the system."
"Because that is basically what we want: we want to have good cooperation between the Member States so that the common customs tariff functions."
"What is the Council's reply?"
"Mrs Theato made it abundantly clear: it is to undermine the effectiveness of the system by changing proposals from the Commission to make them less efficient and more bureaucratic and thereby to contribute to the undoing of the internal market."
"I hold the Council responsible for a lack of political will to have the system function properly."
"That is what is behind this whole issue."
"Mrs Theato very clearly indicated that, of course, there is also the question of the institutional balance between Parliament and the Council."
"How can one seriously say that the need is to have more democracy and more transparency when at exactly the same moment the Council wants to undermine the codecision power of Parliament."
"The titanium dioxide case makes it abundantly clear that Parliament has its rights."
"That is the political heart of the matter."
"My sole question to the Commission is: will it stand firm, possibly even going to court to make the Council accountable for a failure of the internal market system as it now stands to function?"
"Mr President, I am sorry that my colleague Mr Tomlinson cannot be here, but as you all know, the constituent meetings of the various committees are taking place, and it is difficult to be in several places at once."
"Looking at the Chamber, one can clearly see that this report is not a great best-seller, even though it deals with a most important sector and is perhaps one of the best reports ever produced by Mrs Theato."
"But let me make one thing clear: we must sort out the fraudsters in the EU!"
"There are many reasons why public opinion in Europe is not always favourable towards the Union."
"One of them is the stories about how easy it is to commit fraud with the Union's money."
"To put it another way, one justification for European cooperation can be a continuing fight against fraud."
"Another reason for the limited public backing for the EU is of course the ideas about closed doors and the self-perpetuating talk from men in suits."
"To put it another way, a further justification for European cooperation is increased democracy and openness in the Union's decision-making process."
"It should be obvious that this situation has to be taken into account and respected, for example when establishing the legal basis in a specific matter."
"But let me make a second thing clear."
"They have once more been day-dreaming in the Council!"
"We should use Article 235 as little as possible."
"Firstly, because an objective approach in a specific matter should involve the use of Article 100a, not Article 235."
"Secondly, because we wish to have democracy, and openness in the decision-making process."
"Thirdly, because the people see Article 235 as a downward path on which the EU, by taking legislative action in new areas, is moving further and further away from openness and from the principle of being closer to its citizens."
"It may be that this is not bound up quite in this way with Article 235, but once again the fact is that the people see this and we have to take account of it."
"I can therefore only support and commend to the House this valuable piece of work by the rapporteur."
"Another factor is that we have a good committee which is agreed on these matters, and I really do hope that the Council listens and perhaps begins to show more interest in what is happening in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would expect us not just to have special occasions when the Council goes there once in a while by mistake and sees what is happening in the committee."
"The Dutch presidency should listen and take note."
"Then it may start to appreciate what is involved here, and perhaps we can do some work for the European project among the individual members of the Community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, like Parliament, has divided feelings about the situation created by the change in legal basis envisaged by the Council."
"Firstly, it is undeniable that the fight against fraud demands that this proposal for a regulation be quickly brought into force."
"The strengthened machinery for customs cooperation for which it provides, together with, at least, the legal possibility of creating a database for the customs information system respond to an urgent necessity."
"Secondly, the change of legal basis, involving consultation with Parliament instead of codecision and unanimous adoption by Member States instead of qualified majority voting, poses a serious institutional problem for the Commission."
"As you know, when the common guidelines were adopted, the Commission insisted that a statement regretting this development be recorded in the Council minutes. I quote: ' the Commission reserves the right to make use of any legal means open to it' ."
"Of course, the Council acting unanimously really does have the right to modify proposals from the Commission."
"That is not being called into question."
"However, the Commission shares Parliament's opinion that this amendment in particular has no legal basis and also that, by removing the proposal from the field of application of the codecision procedure, the Council is infringing the powers of Parliament."
"Consequently, the Commission awaits with great interest the reaction of the Council to the opinion that Parliament will deliver on the matter."
"Depending on the decision that will then be taken by the Council, the Commission will take a decision in regard to compliance with Community law."
"In more concrete terms, the Commission reserves to itself the possibility of bringing the question of the legal basis before the Court of Justice."
"There in a few words, that I hope are precise and clear, is the Commission's position on the dossier under examination by Parliament."
"The Commission also wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, and eagerly awaits your decision."
"Thank you Mr President, for calling me again."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Bonino very sincerely for her very clear statement."
"I think that the Council benches have also given the relevant signal to the House to resolve this conflict."
"That is in everyone's interest, and I ask you not to think we are working here in private."
"This is a public debate."
"Even if, for various reasons, there are very few Members in the House just now, that does not mean that we are debating in camera."
"I think Mr Blak made that point very clearly, and I would thank him for doing so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.25 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, we have had a few problems with voting in the House this week."
"In the Minutes under paragraph 39 on the revision of the treaties I am listed as voting for that particular paragraph."
"I do not know if it was a malfunction of my fingers or a malfunction of the machine but I intended to vote against it."
"Don't worry, Mr Hallam, we will put the mistake down to the machine and the Minutes will show that you voted correctly."
"Mr President, in yesterday's minutes I am omitted from the list of those present."
"In fact, I may have forgotten to sign the attendance register but I was certainly there, as my participation in the various roll-call votes will testify."
"I would therefore be grateful for any instructions you can give to have the minutes corrected about this."
"Mr Hory, the Minutes will be corrected but your word counts for more than any proof."
"Your word is all we need to correct the Minutes."
"Mr President, I am in the same situation as Mr Hory."
"I do not know whether my word carries as much weight as his does but, like him, I took part in several roll-call votes that testify to my presence here but forgot to sign."
"Mr Bourlanges, I do not know if your very wide knowledge includes the Spanish saying 'Tanto monta, monta tanto, Isabel como Fernando' , but it means your word counts just the same as Mr Hory's."
"Mr President, I rise on a point which I would like you to convey to the President of Parliament."
"By invitations sent out yesterday, we have just been invited to celebrate his presidency at a musical evening on Sunday evening when most Members will not be in Brussels."
"We would all have liked to have been there and as President of the Friends of Music in Parliament I would like to have had earlier notice."
"Perhaps you could convey the regret and apologies of Members who will not be present."
"Mr Kerr, you can be quite sure that I shall convey that message to the President and I associate myself with them, because unfortunately I cannot be at the evening either."
"Mr President, on the same point."
"We have this invitation which is headed Exclusive Recital."
"Of course it is going to be exclusive as an invitation to Members if it is held on a day when Members are not in the place of work."
"However, my question is slightly more fundamental than Mr Kerr's."
"The invitation which invites us to celebrate the inauguration of the new President of the European Parliament comes in the name of Mr Luigi Mormino, chairman of the artistic committee of the European Parliament."
"I know that Mr Mormino has all sorts of qualities but I had never directly associated him with great artistic talent."
"I wanted to know whether this great responsibility as chairman of the artistic committee is one that is distributed by some sort of administrative d'Hondt system amongst the officers."
"This week we have had to decide how we distribute talent amongst the Members."
"Perhaps some time we could be told how Mr Mormino achieves his great rank and honour and how he is then given the authority to have the concert to honour the President at a time when Members cannot come and to do so in association with a private company."
"That is something the President might want to look at."
"I did not want to interrupt Mr Kerr or Mr Tomlinson out of parliamentary courtesy, but I would remind them that we are still on approval of the Minutes."
"So we ought to deal with these issues later."
"I have taken note of what Mr Kerr and Mr Tomlinson said though, and I shall open the appropriate investigation into the musical qualities of the person who has been given the responsibility mentioned."
"But now, ladies and gentlemen, if there are no more comments on the Minutes, I take it they are approved."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Votes"
"The importance of extending the regulations on atmospheric contamination and on protecting forests from fire is beyond a doubt, as I already had occasion to point out in the debate a few years ago."
"Today I am only interested in underlining that one of the great difficulties about establishing the concept of sustainable development in the rural development zones in the south of the Union arises from the serious consequences of forest fires, the summer plague in that part of the Union."
"So the amendments seeking to upgrade the funding for these measures by ECU 70-100 million are essential to proper conservation and regeneration of the forest heritage of the Union."
"I will therefore vote in favour."
"I end, Mr President, by calling, once again, for the establishment of a common forestry policy for the whole Union."
"That would also respond to the Fifth Action Programme on the Environment and the Rio Declaration."
"Cornelissen report (A4-0381/96)"
"I wish to pay tribute to Mr Cornelissen, the author of the report on 'air traffic management' , and to the high quality of his work, whose contents are very satisfactory."
"For this reason, I am naturally voting in favour."
"May I highlight two important elements in the report."
"The first is that of the cost efficiency of air traffic control."
"Although this can legitimately be optimized, such a step must not entail abandoning consideration of the constraints associated with the maintenance of a public air traffic control service, so that the quality of the service provided can be guaranteed over the whole territory covered."
"The second element I wish to emphasize is the promotion of greater safety."
"In any actions that are taken, priority must be given to harmonizing the working methods of air traffic controllers and I am thinking here particularly of the terminology used."
"These two points are covered in amendments broadly approved by members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"They are a useful and welcome addition to this very good report."
"Increased security and better operating systems are required to keep pace with the estimated doubling of air traffic by the year 2000."
"But it should not be taken for granted that it is the EU which should negotiate and regulate these issues."
"It is the Member States which should do this as part of an international interstate process, with as many countries as possible participating."
"A coordinated European 'air traffic authority' should of course cover all European countries and must consequently be regulated at a broader level than the EU."
"I have voted for this report today because I share the concern that not enough is being done to end the frustration and waste of airport delays."
"The frustration caused to the travelling public by such delays is not acceptable."
"People with business appointments should be able to rely on Europe's air traffic control system to get them to their destination on time."
"The same is true for the countless holidaymakers who lose some of their well-deserved break through delayed flights."
"With Manchester Airport close to my constituency, I also know that the airport, its airlines and staff would benefit from the huge savings in time and money which a better traffic control system would bring."
"Whilst I welcome yesterday's decision in favour of a second runway for Manchester Airport, without better air traffic control in future chaos could result for travellers."
"Along with the industry and the millions of air passengers concerned, I will be looking to our governments and the Commission to improve Europe's air traffic systems."
"After all, freedom of movement around Europe is central to our economic future."
"Castricum report (A4-0419/96)"
"This is for the most part a good report, so we will follow the line taken by the Socialist group and vote in favour of it."
"But we do have serious reservations on two points."
"These are Article 13, which states that the best thing for public transport is for it to be put out to private enterprise, and Article 24 which states that running public transport should 'as far as possible be financed with income from tickets' ."
"Article 13 discriminates directly against public companies."
"There is absolutely no evidence in our country, Sweden, that public transport is any less efficient than private."
"As for Article 24, this is a generalisation which is not always true."
"Sometimes (or even often) it is necessary, for social economic reasons, to subsidise heavily the operating costs of public transport."
"Sometimes there is even a need for zero charges."
"In Sweden, public transport would disappear totally from practically all remote areas if operating costs had to be met from the income from ticket sales."
"This would be a totally unacceptable development."
"Public transport is extremely important to many people because it allows them to live a normal life."
"From an environmental point of view it is also an important part of a sustainable society."
"Of course, public transport must be run as cost effectively as possible but, in view of its decisive role and society's overriding responsibility to provide for people's needs, cost effectiveness cannot be the only driving force for the operation of public transport."
"If public transport is to function efficiently, responsibility must rest at local, regional or national level and the same authorities must be responsible for the allocation of financial support."
"This is why we are voting against this report."
"This initiative report contains many points which we support without any reservation and which we will work hard to give a higher profile in the Member States. These include the fact that policy must work towards a reduction in the use of cars and an improvement in public transport and that public transport is environmentally friendly."
"This is why we also think that public transport must be supported and encouraged in a variety of ways."
"On the other hand, we cannot understand why the European Parliament wants the issue of public services to be taken up by the Inter Governmental Conference."
"Nor do we think that the Union should interfere in how Member States chose to support public transport."
"This must be for each individual Member State to decide bearing in mind the different conditions which prevail."
"The Member States are all different, particularly with regard to population density."
"This is the case in Sweden where public transport requires a large input of public funds in view of the low population density in many regions, particularly in the Northern parts of the country."
"This is why it is undesirable for the EU to lay down rigid guidelines and criteria concerning how state subsidies are given to public transport."
"Public Transport is a national and regional matter."
"There is no reason to regulate public transport in the EU Treaty."
"Differing subsidies and means of finance are also national or regional issues."
"Freedom of competition is also something which should be examined at national level not by EU edict."
"Menrad report (A4-0411/96)"
"European business has suffered from the failure to reach agreement on the European Company Statute and related measures."
"Having to take account of company law in 15 different Member States involves extra costs and consequently affects jobs."
"I applaud the Commission's attempts to get these measures passed. If they are adopted, however, they must be accompanied by corresponding rules on the participation rights of workers."
"If not, current information and participation legislation in some Member States would be bypassed by some companies."
"Giving workers a real stake in their companies can only be a positive development both for them and for their firms."
"The national consensus that has existed in Ireland for the last 10 years on wages and conditions has been a contributing factor to the current healthy state of the Irish economy and as such is endorsed by the Employers' Federation, IBEC."
"I do acknowledge that extending information and participation procedures to more companies would entail some costs."
"For this reason, I endorse the Commission's cautious approach, particularly the establishment of a highlevel group, representing the social partners, to study this topic in detail as well as the emphasis on respecting national models."
"EU Transcaucasian strategy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0279/96) by Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Towards a European Union strategy for relations with the Transcaucasian Republics' (COM(95)0205 - C4-0242/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, cannot present his opinion himself today, because he unexpectedly had an important engagement outside Strasbourg."
"On his behalf, I would therefore like to thank Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse for her excellent and in-depth report and also note that she has incorporated all the Committee on External Economic Relations' proposals in her report, which of course gives us great pleasure."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations also welcomes the call for closer regional cooperation between Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, the leitmotif of the entire report."
"Without this cooperation these three countries have little hope of improving their economy and standard of living."
"The bilateral partnership agreements between the EU and these three Transcaucasian republics are based on this need."
"We are concerned with no more nor less than a global political approach that combines economic, political and financial aspects and also includes humanitarian aid."
"The economic resources of these countries can only be developed if the energy and transport infrastructures are modernised on a cross-frontier basis and substantially improved."
"Closer cooperation is needed between Azerbaijan, Georgia and also Armenia in extracting the oil resources of the Caspian Sea - greater than those of Saudi Arabia - for export to Europe and the rest of the world but also for processing in situ ."
"Regional cooperation can also help ease the political tensions in the region."
"Access to the Transeuropean networks and other international trade flows is the only way to open the door to close cooperation with Europe."
"Politically, the aim is the stabilisation of three former Soviet republics that have achieved independence, which implies very radical economical and social changes."
"As a peaceful partner, Europe can achieve a great deal in cooperation with Turkey and Russia."
"So we should aim at the necessary coordination of bilateral relations too, in order to ensure that our desire for cooperation is taken seriously by our Transcaucasian partners; joint and even further-reaching proposals in the framework of bilateral relations, i.e. with Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, could also act as incentives during the future negotiations."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, let me also indicate some of the potential prospects for Azerbaijan, which will perhaps make it easier to understand the problems in Transcaucasia."
"Azerbaijan is potentially a rich country."
"As said earlier, its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are larger than those in Saudi Arabia."
"Its industry, agriculture and services sector also have good development prospects."
"But at present it is a poor country, much in need of economic development."
"It is suffering severely from the lost war with Armenia."
"It is situated on the door-step of the eastward enlargement of the European Union and in a few years will probably only be separated from it by the Black Sea and the Caucasus."
"European investors are most welcome there and are particularly sought after in the oil industry, capital equipment for that industry, transport and the emerging construction industry."
"Azerbaijan is already providing the necessary framework conditions for investment."
"The basic conditions for overcoming the economic crisis are the planning and development of transport routes via Georgia for the oil and derived products."
"All the possible routes and networks should be examined in terms of their profitability and environmental compatibility, which must be borne in mind in our future deliberations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have five points to make briefly."
"Firstly I must pay tribute to Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, the rapporteur."
"Not only is her report technically excellent, in reading it one feels the whole weight of her personality behind the points she upholds in the report."
"I compliment her on it."
"Secondly, she rightly says that this is a region which has seen much tragedy."
"Well, when one studies the problems of these three fledgling republics it becomes clear that their geopolitical and geostrategic importance cannot be overstated and that Europe's duty towards these countries is thus primarily a political one."
"They were independent in 1917, then absorbed into the Soviet Union, and now they are independent again."
"We can do a lot to help here, to ensure that the independence of these countries is established once and for all, that democracy, a very new concept there, is developed, that constitutional rule becomes the norm, that human rights are upheld and a civil society becomes possible."
"Thirdly, I would like to say a word or two on each of the three republics, each of which faces serious problems."
"First of all Georgia: we must do what we can to see that the peace is maintained, that a lasting solution to the tensions there is found."
"Regarding Armenia and the conflict we are familiar with, Karabakh. We must do what we can to ensure that the talks held there with the 'Minsk Group' lead to success."
"On 16 December the Security Council said that the two presidents of the Minsk Group should continue their efforts, continue negotiating and reach agreement."
"So let us be positive rather than negative today about those talks and do what we can to make them succeed."
"Then there is Azerbaijan: we must do what we can to secure a generally recognized legal status for the Caspian Sea, otherwise the question of oil there will be a dangerous source of tensions in future."
"Fourthly, I would make the point that our task there may be a big one, a very big one."
"Mr Schwaiger has already touched on the economic aspects."
"Let me remind you: transport will be hugely important in opening up these areas."
"The European road network will need to link up with whatever happens there."
"It is perfectly feasible for them to become a part of the European economy."
"Their oil and pipelines are extremely important and we must hope that this question will be resolved in a manner which makes economic sense."
"And a modern banking system with central banks which work properly will greatly improve economic relations."
"And my fifth point, Mr President, is that this House should approve Mrs Carr√®re's proposals by a large majority."
"They are most laudable and in this way we can help to open up the route which links Asia, the Middle East and Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I asked to speak not so that I could comment on the report by Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, but to congratulate her on her excellent work."
"The Transcaucasian area is one with many problems: political, economic, social, environmental, and most of all, problems of stability, peace and democracy."
"The report by Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse touches upon all these problems with sensitivity, I would even say with political tenderness, but also with realism."
"It provides answers and proposes solutions that the European Union as a whole - first of all the European Parliament and then the Commission and the Council - should adopt, and in particular implement, taking advantage among other things of the fact that one of its Member States, Greece, plays a substantial and very useful part in the area."
"Together with Russia and Turkey, the European Union must strive in many ways to aid the three countries in the area."
"Those countries themselves, however, must cooperate with the European Union and offer solutions of their own, especially at the level of their internal democracy and human rights."
"But under no circumstances must the European Union remain inactive."
"Even acting on its own, it must do all the fine things recommended in the report and which everyone who spoke in the House today mentioned, even if Russia and Turkey decline to cooperate with us in providing substantial aid to the three countries in the area."
"To conclude, I would once more like to congratulate our colleague Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse on her excellent work, which I believe comes as no surprise to any of us here, because she is a Member with vast experience and knowledge of the area."
"I would also like to hope, with all of you, that all the fine words and good wishes heard here today will not remain just words and wishes, but will become deeds with a substantive outcome for the essential aid that the peoples of the three Transcaucasian countries so desperately need."
"Mr President, once again we are fortunate in being able to benefit from the expertise of H√©l√®ne Carr√®re d'Encausse."
"Both in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the House we have been able on many an occasion to admire her knowledge of affairs in the former Soviet Union."
"Transcaucasia is a powder keg which merits, and is receiving, Europe's attention."
"We welcome the European Commission's initiative of a communication outlining options for a common European policy and the report we are now debating is a worthy response to it by Parliament."
"I hope that the Commission will henceforth always produce a communication on future relations with a region before new agreements are negotiated."
"The mandate for negotiations to conclude agreements with third countries can then be shaped in accordance with the needs of the countries concerned and the consensus which the institutions have reached on the course to be followed vis √† vis those third countries."
"This will increase the likelihood of a coherent policy."
"The collapse of the Soviet Union heralded the start of a difficult period for the Transcaucasian region."
"Simmering tensions came to the surface and the problems in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Ossetia, the blockade of Armenia by its neighbours are illustrations of this."
"The role of neighbouring countries which relapse into a centuries-old reflex of power politics is naturally not conductive to stability."
"Stability in the CIS is very much in the Union's interest."
"And priority should be given here to the southern flank bordering on the Middle East."
"The Union's policy must be more than just aid under TACIS."
"Member States must appreciate that longer-term stability is more productive than short-term trade or oil supplies."
"The European Union must thus devise a global and coherent strategy embracing trade and economy, foreign policy and aid."
"This strategy must be based on recognition of the diversity which exists within the region."
"In its foreign policy the Union must act in concert with specialized agencies such as the Council of Europe and OSCE to secure a lasting peace in the area."
"And I congratulate the OSCE on its efforts over Nagorno-Karabakh and I hope too that the territorial integrity of Georgia can be restored."
"The effectiveness of collective European action would also be further enhanced by the setting up of joint embassies of the Union countries."
"In economic terms we must help to strengthen the economic infrastructure and promote economic cooperation amongst these countries."
"This of course means that the blockade of Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan must be lifted."
"Partnership agreements will be viewed favourably by the European Parliament."
"This favourable attitude on the part of the European Parliament will, of course, depend on the countries concerned showing respect for democracy, civil society and human rights."
"Difficult though things may be at present in these countries, gross violations of these principles will never advance the cause of peace and stability."
"The rapporteur puts forward some good and fruitful ideas on aid and cooperation."
"All in all the Liberal Group concludes that it is a good idea to take a collective approach to our relations with Transcaucasia and that the rapporteur's ideas emphatically deserve the support of the House."
"Mr President, firstly let me note that in her detailed report the rapporteur has set out the European Union's proposals for a strategy of cooperation for this region."
"So the report scarcely differs from the Commission document."
"Transcaucasia is important in several respects, we know that."
"The Caucasus is a geopolitical turntable and at the same time it is still marked by its variety of ethnic groups and the chequered history and traditions that have resulted from the many conflicts in the region, which in principle could be resolved in modern times."
"The region also has enormous raw materials resources, such as the oil reservoir of the Caspian Sea."
"A way must be found of bringing peace to the region not through competition with Russia but jointly, by a strategy formulated within the framework of the OSCE."
"But among the many own interests at play, I do not see the European Union taking responsibility for the region."
"Primarily, Europe is expressing economic interests, which disregard the problems involved in securing a lasting peace and democratization combined with respect for human rights."
"In Armenia as in Azerbaijan, democracy is not yet solidly entrenched."
"Both states indeed wish to be linked to Europe in the near future and are making formal moves in this direction, but there is a wide gulf between wishes and reality."
"There is no real freedom of the press in either country and political opposition is either stifled or banned."
"Moreover, political life in Azerbaijan is still marked by clan structures."
"The prime example is that the key government and economic posts are occupied by President Aliev's confidants."
"Both in Armenia and in Azerbaijan kinship comes first."
"Nationalist tendencies are evident in all sections of the population and there are no measures to oppose the traditional hostilities."
"Georgia is attempting to build up a democratic structure through its new constitution, but there is one feature that is unmistakeably missing: there is no provision for the status of the two regions of conflict, South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"The consequences of the civil war have by no means been overcome through legislation."
"So ratification of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) should be made conditional on a number of criteria, such as respect for human rights and the principles of democracy and also the willingness to endorse the Council of Europe convention."
"The PCAs also include a Chapter 71 on illegal immigration."
"I believe the provisions give a distorted view of the real situation in these countries."
"Warlike conditions still prevail in these countries, which are declared safe third countries by this automatic signature."
"The war between Azerbaijan and Armenia continues."
"What we have is merely a ceasefire."
"Without doubt, at this stage, when torture is still an everyday occurrence, there will continue to be refugees and this third-state clause is therefore a disaster."
"The issue of the civil rights of the millions of refugees has still not been settled and there is no way one could say that the standards demanded by the thirdcountry clause, as defined in the agreements, have been met."
"The peace talks are making no headway, as we saw at the most recent OSCE summit."
"The success of the longterm OSCE mission depends on the support it obtains from the international community and the reputation of the mediators may be high in the field but also depends on that support."
"There is no evidence of support in the field from the European Union."
"There is no coherent strategy based on a common foreign and security policy."
"That is why we should tie ratification of the partnership and cooperation agreements to a peace settlement."
"The problem of the blockade would then resolve itself automatically, for that blockade depends directly on this state of war and could be lifted if a peaceful settlement were achieved."
"But the attempt by the conflicting parties to maintain the status quo means that millions of refugees have to continue living in camps for years on end."
"Whole generations are growing up in camps and I believe that even at this stage of the negotiations it would be possible to provide aid, to obtain improvements, to build a bridge between ECHO and a TACIS programme."
"The first part of our amendment is very confused because of technical hitches."
"We have distributed an edited version and I ask you to put it to the vote."
"The wording is based mainly on the statement by the chairman-in-office of the OSCE summit in Lisbon."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Schroedter."
"When the time comes - that will be at the vote - we will look at the question of your amendment."
"Mr President, Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse's report is very rich in ideas, very passionate and, may I say, even masterly!"
"It is based on a detailed historical analysis with whose broad outline I agree."
"Yes, Transcaucasia is a strategic region with close and long-standing links with European countries as reflected, for example, by the presence of a very large Armenian population in some of them, particularly in France."
"The Transcaucasian countries have a rich history and culture, and a strong national identity."
"Europe must develop an active presence there."
"The success of our activities, however, will depend on three conditions."
"The first is respect for the nations we are addressing."
"If Europe is to be a model for the Transcaucasian countries, it must definitely be that of a Europe of nations, not a federal Europe."
"We must respect the fundamental choices they make; we must, for example, respect the choice of nuclear energy by Armenia as soon as the safety of the Medzamor power station is assured: members of the Transcaucasian Delegation who have been there and saw for themselves."
"The second condition is that Europe takes its responsibilities towards these countries seriously: by recognizing Armenian genocide, which will allow the people of that country to be alive to its own history; by giving very strong support - because it is expected by the countries concerned - to the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."
"Unquestionably, in this case the principle of the inviolability of frontiers must, because of the conditions under which Stalin drew them at the time, yield precedence to the right of nations to self-determination."
"This involves guaranteeing the security of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and putting an end to the blockade imposed on Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan."
"Here, as has already been emphasized, we must monitor the progress of human rights, particularly in Azerbaijan."
"The third condition, Mr President, is that faux pas or blunders must be avoided."
"We ought not to speak of Community embassies."
"Delegations exist and their role must be precisely specified: they cannot take the place of the embassies of Member States."
"In Tbilisi, the Community 'ambassador' calls himself just that."
"He makes a fool of himself by travelling about in an armoured vehicle with a bodyguard, demanding precedence over representatives of Member States."
"In doing this, he does no service to the good relations between Europe and Transcaucasia."
"Let us discourage this sort of departure from reality."
"Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, this report is very interesting but its very title perhaps betrays the extreme nature of a deliberately global approach."
"History shows that any artificial attempt to make Transcaucasia into a political and cultural unit is doomed to failure."
"At the very least, Azerbaijan does not have the same cultural identity as Armenia or Georgia."
"As a result, national policies simply cannot be replaced because they are much more varied in approach than a single European policy."
"For example, we should not forget the special relationship between France and Armenia."
"Another piece of globalization, another inappropriate mixture, is that of paragraph 12, which is needlessly offensive to both Russia and Turkey."
"After all, it is Turkey and not Russia which is blockading Armenia, and this must be recognized."
"Not only that, but paragraph 17 acknowledges the real state of affairs by rightly asking for the blockade to be lifted."
"Having said that, and despite these reservations, it is an excellent thing that the European Union has good relations with three such diverse nations whose common interests with Europe are obvious."
"That is why we are in favour of the report."
"Mr President, ten years ago I worked in newspaper editing and no one then had ever heard of Nagorno-Karabakh, Ingushetia or Dagestan."
"This week, all these years later, the French paper Le Figaro talks of Azerbaijan as the Kuwait of the Caucasus."
"Times may change."
"Why am I as a Dutch MEP interested in this region?"
"Because I think that beneath the soil of the Caucasus lies a product which interests the whole world, and that is important for stability."
"Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse's report reads like a historical novel."
"One thing becomes clear."
"The problems are many and varied and the solutions will be too."
"Europe can play a major role here, firstly by drawing up a list of the region's economic requirements and above all by seeking, by means of an active presence, to underwrite politically the independence of these countries, the furtherance of democracy and the rights of minorities."
"A very important part can be played here by the OSCE, for example."
"There exists an arrangement called the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Area."
"This provides a useful access route to the region, returning via the Danube and the Rhine and ultimately to the North Sea."
"Greece is a signatory and Austria and Italy are observers."
"It would be very important to have those countries involved in active participation in the region."
"Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse has done the groundwork."
"The Commission and Council can now get to work."
"I warmly endorse this report."
"Mr President, I would first like to emphasize the high quality of the masterly report once more presented to us by Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse."
"Not only that, but I am completely convinced by the arguments developed in favour of close cooperation between the European Union and the three Transcaucasian Republics."
"The oil resources in Azerbaijan obviously carry a lot of weight."
"The question that arises is to know whether the need for Europe not to leave the field open to American companies already present in Baku should prevail over the risk it runs in teasing the Russian giant on its frontiers."
"To this question my reply is 'yes' ."
"On the other hand, I do not think we have to take into account the desire of Transcaucasian peoples to become integrated into European structures."
"The Transcaucasian Republics are no more European than Turkey, Morocco or South Korea."
"The argument for a return to Europe, to one of the sources of its culture, is not acceptable unless we are prepared to envisage the incorporation into the European Union of the former Mesopotamia, of Iran, of Iraq and thus, why not, to make Baghdad the capital of a future greater Europe."
"Mr President, I want to begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, for her detailed and excellent report on the strategy towards the Transcaucasian states."
"But I specially want to thank her for the historical overview she has given and which, I believe, is most valuable. It shows clearly that many problems in many regions can only be understood and tackled if they are placed in their historical and also their religious context."
"However, let me also point out that I see a hint of politics in this historical overview, especially in the description of the Russian puppet Shevardnadze, who I believe is always painted in too good a light."
"Finally, I would like to use my brief speaking to underline the importance of the Transcaucasian region - especially in with regard to its links with its neighbours, in particular Turkey - in terms of our future energy supplies."
"We must do our utmost, in the interests of the people of Transcaucasia but also in our own European interests, to seek stability in this region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say how sorry I am that implacably strict time limits prevented us hearing Mrs Carr√®re d'Encausse, the undisputed authority on the issues in this region."
"I want to congratulate her on this very exhaustive and profound report. She has done the Union a great service by highlighting the strategic importance of the region and emphasizing our interests in it."
"The first of those interests is the need to help these countries; help them to evolve into independent democracies, tightening their bonds with Europe and putting an end to the conflicts they are involved in."
"In spite of the time that has gone by since the Commission's communication on a possible European Union strategy in the region was drafted, sadly the situation in the Caucasus has not changed substantially."
"There can be no lasting recovery unless the three countries concerned can find a way to coexist with their neighbours, and there will be no return on all the investment we have made in terms of humanitarian and food aid, technical assistance and loans, which amounts to over ECU 800 million since independence."
"We hoped to take advantage of our position as leading donor in the region to support the international efforts to resolve the conflicts, especially in Nagorno-Karabakh."
"Although the Council did not reach a common position on the lines of our proposal, it did adopt some conclusions which have allowed us to promote regional cooperation in the Caucasus, both through the collaboration and cooperation agreements and through our TACIS programme, especially in the areas of energy and transport."
"Thanks to the latter, we still have the resources to pursue our economic cooperation with each republic in line with our policy objectives."
"It also provides us with the framework for developing the European economic presence, thus bringing equilibrium to the security issues that dominate politics, especially in Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"For all these reasons, I consider early ratification of the three agreements essential. The aim in drafting them was that they should be as similar as possible."
"If we aspire to play an important role in the region, our relations with each of these countries requires special attention and, at the moment, the Commission is not only welcomed as an important donor, but is also respected - and this was recognized in some of the speeches here - for its impartiality."
"It is essential that we continue to demonstrate that we understand the problems which all the parties must face up to."
"And when the report speaks of the need to open the frontiers between Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, we must remember that while Armenia's concern is the blockade, Azerbaijan's is to end the occupation of its territories, including those outside Nagorno-Karabakh, and the return with guarantees of over a million refugees."
"The Commission will monitor the development of democracy in the region closely and bring pressure to bear to ensure that progress continues."
"And the OSCE report on the presidential elections in Armenia reveals that democracy problems are not confined to Azerbaijan."
"The most important thing is that the two countries understand that there must be improvements, and to achieve that we must provide support through our technical assistance programmes, and emphasize that the stronger our bilateral relations, the more opportunities we will have to make real progress."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, but I have to draw your attention to the position of the Greens again."
"We could not vote for the report in the form in which it has just been approved, with the amendments, because it represents a very one-sided strategy marked primarily by the desire of the various European states to get at the oil resources of the Caspian Sea fairly rapidly and not to let their rivals get there first."
"Anyone who has been down there and seen these heavily polluted oil fields knows that we have a quite different responsibility towards this region, other than getting at the oil resources as soon as possible."
"We have the responsibility to establish peace in the region."
"I see no really effective strategy in that direction."
"Rapid adoption of the partnership and cooperation agreements, not linked to a peaceful solution, and a blanket demand for the blockade to be lifted make it clear, firstly, that Europe has very little understanding of this region and secondly, that this will certainly not promote a settlement of the conflicts."
"When the PCAs are adopted and enter into force it will mean that a large section of the population, indeed several millions of people, who do not even live there any more cannot benefit from the aid."
"It means that NagornoKarabakh cannot benefit."
"Or do you want to give aid to Nagorno-Karabakh via the Latchin corridor, which would go against international law?"
"The PCAs cannot enter into force without a peaceful solution to this conflict."
"Of course we must use all our funds and energies to help where help is needed."
"But the European Union is not doing anything."
"It is not doing anything to extend the ECHO mandate and build a bridge."
"It is not doing anything about modifying TACIS and adopting social measures to tackle the problem and it is doing nothing when it comes to genuinely promoting a peaceful settlement."
"We hear many splendid words, but there is no understanding of the real problems of the region."
"We cannot endorse this kind of strategy, which may be well-meaning but totally overlooks the real facts."
"Mr President, I wish to explain the reason why, in spite of what I said just now, I voted against the final version of the report before us, thus being the only Member to have done so."
"I agree with the contents of the report except for one word, a word that for me is fundamental, when it says that we encourage the Commission and the Council to open Community embassies."
"The Community cannot have an embassy in a country."
"Doing this, and wanting to do it ignoring reality, is to do the European Union no favours."
"At present, contrary to what speakers said just now, embassies of several countries do exist."
"There are four or five of them for each of the three Transcaucasian countries."
"Contrary to what was said, the ambassadors do coordinate their activities; there is even a presidency provided by the ambassadors, even though the presidency of the Union is not one of the countries represented by an embassy."
"The Commission delegation, on the other hand, must be a delegation and not an embassy."
"I saw at first hand in Georgia how dangerous it could be to call what should remain a delegation an 'embassy' ."
"That is why I voted against the report, but I must make it clear that I agree with its main points."
"We have voted in favour of this report as we consider it important that EU Member States establish relations, trade and cooperation with the Transcaucasian States and give support."
"As we are opposed to EU attempts to develop a Common Foreign Policy, we are against the report's emphasis on CFSP, particularly the ideas on establishing special EU ambassadors."
"In my view, the EU should not establish their own embassies but establish relations with the outside world in other ways."
"I am totally in agreement with the report's views on the importance of helping the Transcaucasian Republics."
"But I do have reservations with regard to points 1 and 36 where there is mention of the Union's need to establish specific joint embassies."
"I do not consider the EU to be a legal person which can establish embassies."
"This should be the preserve of individual nations."
"Protection of geographical indications and designations of origin"
"The next item is the report (A4-0412/96) by Mr Fantuzzi, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (COM(96)0266 - C4-0439/96-96/0159(CNS))."
"Mr President, I do not know whether all honourable Members have read the explanatory statement to this report."
"I think it expresses some concern and also a degree of bitterness about the way in which the application of Regulation No 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs is being handled."
"And it might be said that even now we are experiencing confrontation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an issue which I consider to be highly sensitive and delicate."
"The background is well-known: on the basis of the decision on feta cheese, which was registered as a typical product of European origin as of June 1996, the Commission put forward today's proposal: to set the transitional period during which a product which usurps, evokes or imitates the true origin of a registered product may be authorized - currently five years from the date of publication of the regulation and applicable to all products - at five years from the date of registration of each individual product, in other words, to all intents and purposes, as of now."
"It could be said that this is a small, straightforward, technical amendment motivated solely by the objective delay which has occurred in implementing the regulation."
"I think otherwise, and that is why I am expressing concern."
"Let us be clear about this: Parliament's Committee on Agriculture also recognizes the delay; on several occasions we have indeed condemned it, going so far as to describe it as culpable."
"I recall that on 26 October 1995 an oral question was put in this Chamber, and in the final resolution the Commission was asked to put an end to this delay, which was having serious effects for producers and consumers."
"It seems to me that this issue has not been taken seriously and that improper use of the simplified procedure has been endorsed."
"I have to say that not until 1996, midway through the year, did we have the first two packages of registered products."
"So if the delay is the real, objective reason for these technical amendments, I think it behoves the Commission and the Council to accept the ideas contained in my report, namely to increase the five-year period provided for in Regulation No 2081/92 to seven years, to run from the date of publication of the regulation, and to allow for a further possibility of extension for certain products, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15, while complying with the spirit of Regulation No 2081/92 and the thinking behind it."
"I fear, however, that rather than the delay being the real reason, this proposal, as it stands, is using it as an excuse, offering encouragement to those who oppose this regulation, and we know how many they have been and still are."
"I do not think that turning the clock back to zero as regards the transitional period gives a good political signal, not least because one of the advantages of the new World Trade Organization is the existence of the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, Article 22 of which indeed provides for the possibility of protecting agrifoodstuffs with a geographical designation of origin in world markets."
"So, with these changes, what kind of credibility are we going to have with our partners outside Europe when we seek their compliance?"
"I think, moreover, that we are denying ourselves the opportunity of turning an established source of quality products to good account."
"Although, after the mad cow crisis, we have all recognized that an automatic link which used to exist between consumer confidence and the quality of farming has been broken, some vestiges do, after all, remain."
"And I think that this idea of typical products could objectively, and with good reason, win back consumer confidence."
"I do not think that 'typical products' should be a label that is just bandied around: they are an expression of the huge funds of knowledge and professionalism of European farming as a whole."
"I think it would amount to a big gift to the Americans if we turned our backs on this."
"Lastly, I think the Commission should tell us when it will be completing the planned lists, implementing the new packages which will, I hope, finally bring to an end the simplified procedure provided for under Article 17 of Regulation No 2081/92."
"In my view, this response is very important, because we must embark on a new phase of applying the regulations, launching the ordinary procedure which will put an end to this mode of operation which has been beset with so many problems and so much delay, and should soon be replaced."
"Mr President, I speak to the proposal for a Council regulation amending a regulation."
"There is always a case for exceptions as we have seen in the original regulation. The simplified process allowed was an exception."
"However, we should not allow the exception to become the rule, except in exceptional circumstances."
"We are arguing here about two years."
"The Commission wants the date 1996 plus five years."
"Our rapporteur proposes the original date 1992 plus seven years."
"We say 1999, they say 2001."
"The protection of geographical indications is a good idea."
"It can add value to produce from poorer rural areas."
"It can ensure quality."
"It can be used by smaller interests to counteract the power of international company interest."
"But, if we slacken deadlines, if we loosen the agenda, if we are laborious, it will be thought we are either not serious or not efficient."
"The Commission rightly wants to improve the situation. But Mr Fantuzzi's amended text is better and I ask you to support it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agriculture is without doubt in the process of changing direction."
"Liberalization through the WTO, more and more new and improved production methods, together with international competition, have brought major changes in recent years."
"Obviously we should not lump everything together indiscriminately, yet I do think that somehow BSE fits into the picture."
"We must take care that agriculture does not unintentionally move in a direction that is remote from the people."
"The coming years will have to bring some reforms with them."
"And we must pay special attention to consumer wishes."
"It seems quite clear that the consumers largely want natural and healthy products and that natural production methods and small-scale farming will also benefit the rural areas."
"One of the main aspects of this new trend is to make the origins and ingredients of agricultural products clearly identifiable."
"This also involves designations of origin as provided for in Regulation 2081 which we are discussing here and the labelling of beef, which is finally to be introduced in the wake of the BSE disaster."
"That is the only way finally to restore consumer confidence and the only way to ensure fair competition between producers and the free market."
"Of course the traditions and cultural differences of the European regions must also be reflected."
"I think I may say that every region in this European Union has its own quite specific features and, I am sure, its own advantages."
"As a wise man once said, every situation has its own advantages."
"The question is, how to use them."
"We have an opportunity to ensure that our products enjoy a good reputation and are protected from unwanted imitation."
"Of course the natural boundaries are fluid in this area too."
"For decades now, many products that originally came from a very specific region are being produced in other regions as a matter of course."
"That is why I would plead that we set the appropriate transitional periods to cushion the adverse effects on the producers concerned."
"Looking in particular at my home country Austria, I really would ask for your consideration, since very many of our products are produced in problem areas."
"Mr Fantuzzi's report responds to this concern and provides for the possibility of extending the transitional period."
"I think that is the right direction."
"Mr President, this proposal for a regulation is beginning to look like a kind of amnesty, a somewhat belated response to a problem of vital importance for the relationship of confidence between producers and consumers."
"At this point, after so much time has been wasted, we can only hope that the bureaucracy will speed up and allow the procedures to be completed more quickly than the time it took to reach the appraisal stage."
"Article 13 provides for a transitional period of a maximum of five years from the date of publication of the regulation to allow Member States to maintain national measures authorizing the expressions mentioned in paragraph 1(b), subject to certain conditions: first and foremost the products must have been lawfully placed on the market, with the designations concerned, at least five years before the date of publication of the regulation; secondly, the true origin of the products must be clearly shown on the labels."
"I agree with the rapporteur's proposal that the transitional period should be extended to seven years and that products should be entitled to benefit from a further extension in the event of proven difficulties."
"But, let me see, seven years would take us from 1992, when the regulation came into being, to 1999, not as the Commission is seeking to propose."
"Five years - but from which date?"
"From the date of publication of the regulation, in other words from this year - at least so we hope - taking us up to 2002 with the current difficult state of affairs."
"This would mean that, in the meantime, the Danes would carry on producing the infamous Greek feta cheese - thus confusing the consumer - and the Germans would carry on making typical Italian 'grana ' cheese under a German brand."
"Mr President, this is not a sign of freedom: it is common commercial plagiarism."
"This is not what Europe is about!"
"Yesterday I read an interview with a sociologist who said he rejected the idea of European integration based on smoothing out identities, on the same beer from Hamburg to Palermo or wine that tastes the same from Greece to Brittany."
"Well, I do not think that this is a problem of European unity; it is just an example of industrial confusion."
"Protected geographical designations and indications could serve as a kind of certificate to preserve producer identities, without jeopardizing freedom of movement in a market which, of course, must continue to be on a European scale."
"So approval for agricultural and industrial products is simply a political issue, just as is the case for citizens who are born and remain German, Portuguese or Italian but live as European citizens."
"This must apply to the products of the land as well."
"Mr President, Europe is truly a fantastic continent and the EU is also a fantastic area with its multilingual and multicultural character."
"We could even call ourselves 'multi gastronomic' because we have very different food cultures in the various parts of the Union."
"This also means that we often use different names for the same thing, which is only natural as we all use different languages."
"On the other hand, sometimes we also call different things by the same name which is not really the right thing to do."
"All this is a very difficult area and it is important that we try to sort it out."
"It is also important to note that, as a result of European integration and economic integration we are all the time concentrating our activities in large central bodies."
"It is not entirely clear whether the food consumer considers this to be a very good thing."
"Perhaps it is just that the food consumer would like to keep the local character of their food, or perhaps he or she would like to think that they know how a certain food is produced?"
"In this respect, labelling of both origin and geographic area is important as long as this is not misused."
"I have some experience of the Swedish membership discussions and I know that this issue was discussed a great deal."
"It is true that the names and terms that we use for products in Sweden are not always appropriate in an EU context but we would like to keep them anyway."
"For this reason, I think it is important that we settle this matter to avoid misunderstandings in the future."
"But there must be some flexibility to allow us to accept that a country may use a certain traditional name in their own country for the time being or until the matter has been resolved by some other means."
"For this reason, I value the fact that a time limit has been set and I consider, deep down, the Commission's time limit to be preferable."
"I would also like to think that there could be an extension to this time limit in case of difficulties with any one particular product."
"I would prefer not to see any restrictions on this opportunity for extension."
"Mr President, I think now that we can vote on this report and I hope that we can, after all, reach agreement."
"I agree, for the most part, with Mr Fantuzzi as long as we appreciate that there are a number of problems particularly in the new Member States."
"Mr President, high-quality regional farming areas and agricultural products require a powerful European protection system in the context of the single market."
"Setting up systems for the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin is a move in that direction."
"The Commission is still refusing to consider the request from some Member States for temporary national protection pending final Community recording of new designations."
"To begin with, the Regulation allowed Member States to keep their national denominations for five years after publication of the Regulation, in this case until 1997."
"The Commission has proposed that the starting date for the transitional period be changed by replacing the date of the Regulation by the date of publication of registration of the products in question."
"You can immediately imagine the difficulty of monitoring that would involve."
"Our colleague, Mr Fantuzzi, rightly considers that the Commission has failed in taking so long to deal with the registrations, thus penalizing producers and cultivators who, when the single market was introduced, legitimately expected their denominations to be exclusive throughout Community territory."
"The rapporteur's proposal is simple: to extend the transitional period to seven years to be counted from the date on which the Regulation comes into force."
"This is a good proposal, which has the merit of facilitating monitoring."
"More generally, in the area of protection and movement within the Community of farmland products, much progress is still needed to create the Europe we all want."
"I recently discussed the problem with producers in Alsace and found that agricultural producers, winegrowers and small-holders in our region still face legal, fiscal and administrative constraints in some Member States, constraints that are simply disguised forms of protectionism."
"It would therefore seem that, for products of the soil, the great single market is not bringing anything new."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our committees must look into these malfunctionings so that our excellent high-quality products can at last circulate freely throughout the Union, with unified regulations to increase transparency and for the greater satisfaction of our European consumers and citizens."
"Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur's proposal because it picks up on a view which has gained wide support among agricultural producers and, above all, it refers to the opportunities provided for in the market."
"There is widespread enthusiasm for the idea of the market as a fundamental reference point for the organization of production and also as a factor in guaranteeing income."
"It is well-known that designations of origin of production and geographical designations can help maintain income levels, stimulate agriculture and, of course, also eliminate a policy of subsidies which, up to this stage, has been maintained not least because of the manifestly low incomes in many farms in the European Union."
"In those terms, then, we must ensure that the Commission's action is more specific and better targeted, and further exemptions cannot be tolerated."
"Naturally, regulations must not be the only point of reference, because the market can also be approached using specific, carefully targeted action by producer associations and via the quality assurance groups which have also stolen a march on the regulatory approach and made the European Union itself acknowledge that there is an aspect of market operation and a product element in need of protection."
"We therefore believe that this action, including that of the producer associations, should be given a further boost and that there is, of course, a need to speed up the excessively bureaucratic and cumbersome procedure which the industry currently has to negotiate in order to be awarded protected geographical indications and designations of origin."
"Mr President, by and large I agree with Mr Fantuzzi's report and I must say that we need the transitional period, for of course it is also a question of jobs in undertakings."
"We have to consider that too."
"If an undertaking has to restructure, we must realise that this could cause hardship, which needs to be compensated for."
"In general I am in favour of promoting our European specialities much more strongly."
"Everywhere I go, in every country, I see McDonald's, Burger King, Coca Cola, even outside Europe."
"It really is a reflection of the poverty of our own food industry that we have not managed to create these mass-processing distribution systems because it means we are losing large shares of the market."
"In that regard we Europeans should take better care of and do more for our own speciality products, which also have a long tradition and go down well with the consumer."
"When examining the question I came across some very curious things."
"We have spent a long time on BSE and everyone has said they want labelling so that they will not be infected."
"The Swiss then had to observe an export ban and we suddenly found that the Swiss make their world-famous B√ºndner meat from Argentinian beef."
"This meat does not even come from Swiss cows!"
"Quite honestly, if we are as particular as Mr Baldarelli said, we will also discover that in Italy, as I found during a visit there, Parmesan cheese is successfully being made from milk produced in Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg."
"We should not blame each other for something which is in fact not blame-worthy, for the cheese tastes wonderful; incidentally, it is then sent back to Germany."
"I am a lover of Parmesan cheese, I must confess, and drink W√ºrttemberg wine with it."
"Not a bad idea, because it is a good wine."
"So we should set a high level of protection, but I agree with the Commission proposal that we should have a transitional period of five years from the date of publication so as to give enough time for restructuring."
"Apart from that I agree with what the rapporteur said."
"We should endeavour to give more prominence to our European specialities and thereby also give our consumers a sense of quality on which they can rely."
"By the illegal use of hormones, as a result of BSE and so forth, our image has suffered so much in relation to meat that it is vital we use this opportunity to restore consumer confidence."
"But we need a certain transitional period to do so."
"If we can agree on that, then we will fully endorse Mr Fantuzzi's report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is a certain historical reality in each European country which must be defended."
"There is no doubt at all that uniformization and globalization carried out by all of the Duponts in the history of Europe leading to more and more Duponts, must be avoided."
"Thank goodness if we can have something which is not a Dupont."
"Something which is not a Dupont obviously is a product of a certain origin, it is a geographical notion, which means that port is port and madeira is madeira and neither of them can be made in California or Australia."
"If Europe really wants to defend some of its history, some of its individuality, and not end up resembling the rest of the world - it is not that we are superior it is just that we are different - we really must defend our products, we must defend indications of origin and we must defend geographical indications."
"Therefore, the Commission really must not beat around the bush as it has been doing. The Commission should not wait for those who have not asked to be protected which means that those who have asked are not protected."
"It really must respect the values which exist and it has failed to do so and that can only be described as censorship."
"Mr President, I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fantuzzi, for the very good work he has done on his report, examining and revising the legislation on the protection and designation of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"This is an issue of great importance both for producers and for consumers."
"Producers of particular high-quality, regional specialities need guarantees that their products are not being copied and then marketed either at premium or cut prices as though they were the genuine article."
"Consumers need to know exactly what they are buying, whether it is genuine champagne or Wensleydale cheese or similar, possibly even equally excellent products, but from another region."
"As Mr Fantuzzi has pointed out, the Commission was concerned that the five-year transitional period is proving insufficient to register all the products which are seeking designation as protected regional products or foodstuffs."
"It has proposed a new five-year transitional period from 1996 for each product not yet registered, starting from the date of application, instead of from the date originally agreed."
"As our rapporteur has pointed out, this would mean the whole process could drag on for many years, confusing the situation and undermining the effectiveness of the legislation."
"His amendment to extend the transition period by a fixed period namely, from five to seven years - eight in very exceptional circumstances - from the original reference date, should concentrate the minds of both producers making applications and officials processing those applications to ensure that they do meet that deadline."
"He also proposes allowing national measures to protect those products until a Community decision has been made."
"These are common sense proposals from Mr Fantuzzi for greater transparency and clarity in the implementation of the regulations which will benefit both producers and consumers."
"I urge you to support them."
"Mr President, I absolutely agree with what Mr Fantuzzi, the rapporteur, has said and with the points made by Mr Santini, and so I will not go over those issues again."
"I should like to use the time available to me to identify and explain the implications of today's debate, which may appear very specific but which does call to mind a number of views of the problems of European agriculture and approaches to those problems."
"Before I do this, however, I should like to reassure my colleague and dear friend, Mr Funk, that it is impossible to make parmigiano reggiano - ' grana' parmigiano reggiano - from Bavarian milk, and that the criteria for monitoring parmigiano reggiano could serve as an example for other products, as regards quality in particular."
"I come from a family of dairy farmers who have always made parmigiano reggiano , so I know what I am talking about."
"Well, I mentioned that there are a number of views."
"We all talk about quality, but - please forgive my schematic approach - there are two ways of looking at quality, which always emerge and have, I think, been apparent in this morning's debate."
"Some of us, when we talk about quality, are thinking of small and medium-sized producers and the need for them to be rewarded if they make quality products; others are at the same time thinking of consumers, who are entitled to know exactly what they are buying and consuming; and then there are those who, while they talk about consumers, are actually thinking of the large companies engaged in large-scale agricultural and industrial production, the big multinational distributors, who raise the issue of quality in an attempt to make it serve interests which have nothing to do with those of small and medium-sized producers and consumers."
"We need to be clear about this."
"I think that we should take measures which enable us to go beyond the limits that are still present in the rules, which must be clear, definitive rules and aim for application of Regulation No 2081/92 and not its amendment."
"We need for less bureaucracy and more transparency in the distribution of powers between the European Union and the Member States."
"If we are to achieve that outcome, I think that Amendments Nos 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12 should be rejected."
"I therefore call upon all Members of the House, if they are going to demonstrate consistency, to reject those amendments - Nos 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12 - otherwise, we shall not be practising what we preach."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur, Mr Fantuzzi, for their constructive statement on this issue, which was the subject of an animated debate in the European Parliament last October."
"Regulation 2081/92 on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin prohibits the use of registered and protected names even if used with certain expressions, except during the transitional period established in that Regulation."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal is to allow producers who can no longer use registered names to adapt to the law."
"Consequently this period must be long enough to allow the producers to take the necessary action on marketing, labelling, and so on."
"Given that the first proposal for registration of geographical indications and designations of origin under the simplified procedure was not presented until March 1996, and the current transitional period expires on 25 July 1997, measures must be taken to make the period effective from the date of registration of the names and not from the date of publication of the regulation."
"So the proposal to amend paragraph 2 of Article 13 of Regulation 2081/92 is intended to ensure that the 5-year transitional period applies from the date the names are registered."
"But this will only affect existing names registered under the simplified procedure laid down in Article 17, not new ones registered under the normal procedure, laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7."
"Secondly, the transitional period will also be applicable to letter a) of paragraph 1, Article 13 of the regulation not just to letter b) of paragraph 1, Article 13."
"The aim of this provision is that during the transitional period the term 'feta' , for example, can be used as such, while under the existing rules, only expressions like feta-style, feta-type, feta method, etc., are used during transition."
"Thirdly, given that already existing names used in the Member States are notified according to Article 17 - the simplified procedure, the transitional period must apply only to names registered by virtue of this provision, to prevent damage to producers by granting this adaptation period for new names."
"Moving on to the amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 5, as this proposal is insufficient, in the view of the Commission, to allow the producers affected to adapt to the new legal ban on using registered names."
"Amendments Nos 2 and 8 cannot be accepted because under paragraph 3 of Article 17 the Commission must decide for or against each denomination presented for registration."
"However, the aims of Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 11, first part, may be useful and will be examined."
"We are going to find a more appropriate formula on these issues."
"Amendment No 7 seems to us superfluous given that the Commission's proposal provides for a period of 5 years, and the objective of Amendment No 6 already exists in the text, so we do not think that amendment is necessary."
"Amendment No 11, second part, cannot be accepted because a Member State cannot establish a transitional period."
"And we think No 12 would not be useful because it is more restrictive than the Commission's proposal."
"We agree to accept Amendments Nos 3 and 9."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.20 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I hereby declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on 17 January 1997."
"Mr President, with the best will in the world I have to say it is intolerable that when we need to be here by 3 o'clock people have the nerve to block off all the lifts just because a delegation is about to arrive."
"If these delegations want to come up, Mr President, they should be punctual just as we have to be."
"It is not right that we should have to trudge up on foot or argue the toss with officials of Parliament who refuse us access to the lifts."
"That really is not good enough."
"Will you please do something about it?"
"Mr President, I should like to point out that the College of Quaestors clearly instructs that on the days of sittings visitors are not allowed to use those corridors and lifts."
"Would you use your authority to ensure that decision of the college is implemented?"
"Mr Balfe, you have responded to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's justifiable concern. The quaestors have already anticipated her request to stop such incidents occurring."
"Mr President, I welcome you to your first complete session."
"Since the last part-session, a French resident called Monsieur Goldsmith has been putting up publicity in my Member State, the United Kingdom, claiming that 100 rules a week are being put forward by Brussels."
"Would the Bureau look into the accuracy of this statement and report back to Parliament?"
"Thank you, Mrs Crawley. It seems to me that an expert Member like yourself needs no comfirmation that of course it is impossible to introduce 100 rules, or even 10, in a week."
"Every Member knows that and I hope citizens with common sense know it too."
"Mr President, I rise to support Mrs Crawley."
"She points to a very important fact, namely that there is an awful lot of misrepresentation in Britain about what is happening in the European Union."
"It is a question to a large extent of the press not reporting properly what is happening in this place and in other institutions of the Community."
"There is a fundamental question here of whether our work is recognized properly."
"So I hope, Mr President, you will not just dismiss what Mrs Crawley has said but will take it on board and have a look in the Bureau as to how this might be tackled."
"Mr President, while agreeing with the substance of what she said, I should like to correct Mrs Crawley."
"She described Mr Goldsmith as a resident of France."
"But of course he is also a resident of Italy, Britain, Mexico and one or two other places as well."
"We should make that quite clear."
"Thank you very much, Mr Collins."
"I thought we were going to have a real House of Commons debate, but I see that Mr Berthu wants to speak as well."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the remarks of the chairman of my group are the subject of so much attention here."
"You are a punctilious lawyer and you are right to say that if one takes the word 'rule' in its strictest sense, there are not hundreds."
"But if one takes all the directives, regulations, and all the acts of the European Communities, and everybody knows there are a lot of them, they account for a considerable thickness of the Official Journal of the European Communities, every year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a full agenda this evening, and I think the issue is clear enough after those comments."
"The Bureau will take the appropriate steps to identify the number of directives, rules and so on, and have them published."
"I am sure Commissioner Oreja, responsible for information, together with one of our Vice Presidents, Mr Anastassopoulos, has the resources necessary to let the truth shine through."
"Order of business"
"We now come to the order of business."
"The final draft agenda has been distributed, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The following changes are proposed or incorporated."
"Wednesday: The report by Mr Danesin, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, ' Towards a new maritime strategy' , was not adopted in committee and has consequently been taken off the agenda."
"Thursday: At the request of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, I propose that the debate on the Van Lancker report on the future operation of Schengen be held tomorrow, Thursday, but that the deadline for amendments be extended to Thursday 13 February and that the vote be postponed to the next part-session."
"Mr President, thank you for that notification, but on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I should like to ask you to adopt a different procedure."
"We would prefer Mrs van Lancker's report not to be dealt with in that form tomorrow - we would like to see both the debate and the vote postponed to the next part-session."
"Perhaps I could quickly explain why."
"There were 88 proposed amendments to Mrs van Lancker's report, some of which proved very contentious in committee and resulted in very close votes. After discussing and voting on the amendments, we agreed in committee that the rapporteur should be given the opportunity to negotiate compromise wordings with other groups which would enable this important report on the status of implementation of the Schengen agreement to achieve the broadest consensus possible in Parliament."
"But there simply was not enough time to do that by tomorrow."
"In any case, there is no point in holding a debate when compromises still have to be negotiated as a basis for that debate, because it will then not be possible for the compromises to be dealt with in the debate at all."
"That is pointless."
"So it is much more logical to postpone both the debate and the vote to the next or next-but-one partsession in Strasbourg, and that is what I would ask you to do."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my firm opposition to separating the debate from the vote that follows it."
"We should be doing ourselves a great disservice if we were just to hold the debate tomorrow and then fail to reach a clearly apparent decision on that debate immediately."
"We have no hope of getting any media attention for our projects if we hold a debate and then vote on it later, at a time when the connection between the vote and the debate is no longer apparent."
"Secondly, we would ask you not to take the report off the agenda but to follow the procedure on the agenda."
"It is true, and here I must agree with Mr Schulz, that we have made efforts to find additional compromises."
"But we have also tabled sufficient amendments to enable an agreement to be reached in this matter."
"So I ask you to leave the report on the agenda, as it stands, and to allow us both to debate it and to vote on it."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nassauer."
"I think the best course is for Parliament to decide whether or not the debate and vote on Mrs Van Lancker's report should remain on the agenda."
"We will now vote on the request to take Mrs Van Lancker's report off the agenda."
"(Parliament approved the request) As regards voting time, I would remind you that the following two items postponed from the sitting of 16 January will be included:"
"the motion for a resolution contained in the report by Mr Thomas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I would remind you that this report requires a qualified majority.-the seven motions for resolutions on the Commission's statement on the outcome of the Fisheries Council."
"Decision on urgency"
"In making this request for urgency, the Commission has done two things."
"Firstly, it has confessed its own irresponsibility."
"Secondly, it has paid the Parliament an enormous compliment."
"It is irresponsible because this was referred to Parliament on 10 January this year."
"This is 29 January and without any scrutiny whatsoever, without any consideration, the Commission wanted us simply to pass this."
"I am afraid the principles involved are far too important for that."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, in consultation with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, needs time to consider the matter."
"We are proceeding with urgency and we will be able to have it on the agenda in February."
"Therefore my recommendation on behalf of the committee is No."
"Having made the proposal, the Commission is paying us all a very great compliment."
"This is a regulation that should have expired on 31 December and on the assumption that the Commission was preparing a new proposal and on the assumption that it spends about six months preparing it, it evidently believes that Parliament is roughly seven or eight times more efficient than the Commission because it wanted us to do in three weeks, what took the Commission six months."
"So it thought we were seven or eight times more efficient."
"But I am sorry to say that we are only six times more efficient because we cannot do it until February."
"Thank you very much, Mr Collins."
"If no-one else wants to speak, I shall put the request for urgent procedure to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the state of progress at the Intergovernmental Conference: enhanced cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of flexibility, which we discussed for many months in the reflection group, was on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda during the Irish Presidency, on the agenda for the meeting of officials of 13 January, held in Amsterdam under the current Dutch Presidency, and also at the last minister-level meeting of the IGC, held on 20 January."
"As you know, flexibility will be at the centre of Intergovernmental Conference debates for a long time."
"For one thing, because of the impact that any particular solution may have on the institutional structure of the Union and its operation and, for another, because this idea is being defined in a wide variety of ways which reflect very different concepts, as you are well aware."
"But at least in terms of the first pillar, it seems to me that the various proposals that have been presented in the IGC interpret flexibility as a procedure for overcoming obstacles to the proper functioning of the Union and the development of integration."
"In the majority of cases, these obstacles derive from the unanimity rule."
"So it would amount to making closer cooperation possible to achieve the objectives of the treaty more rapidly."
"And here I think it is important to stress that Parliament has already mentioned the idea of 'different rhythms of integration' on numerous occasions."
"This idea dominates the debate on the enlargement, and is more geared to effective transitional periods to make the accession of candidate countries possible, than to this notion of flexibility."
"The debate currently taking place in the IGC abounds with questions."
"Should a flexibility clause be introduced into the treaty?"
"And if so, how?"
"Where should flexibility apply?"
"Should it be limited to the second and third pillar?"
"Or will it be possible for the first pillar as well?"
"The Commission has particularly concentrated on the first pillar, which presents the most problems, at least from the legal point of view."
"Flexibility is certainly easier to envisage for the second and third pillars, given their intergovernmental nature."
"The Commission maintains the position it took in its statement of 28 February 1996."
"As you know, that is a fairly narrow position. Flexibility should be possible if it is compatible with achieving the objectives of the treaty, if it respects the single institutional framework, if it does not undermine the acquis communautaire and, in particular, the four basic freedoms, the internal market, the common policies and the flanking policies, and if it is open to every Member State, so that each can join enhanced cooperation at any time."
"The Commission is not in favour of making lists of issues which can or cannot be dealt with through enhanced cooperation."
"A positive list might encourage differences and damage efforts to find common solutions."
"A negative list could generate an exclusion effect where that might be not be justified."
"I would like to spend a little time on the Commission's proposals for developing enhanced cooperation. The steps are as follows: a Commission initiative, at the request of Member States; participation by the European Parliament; decision by qualified majority, in principle."
"The Commission emphasizes the need to maintain the unity of the institutions even under enhanced cooperation, in the sense that the Commission, the Parliament and the Court of Justice do not represent the Member States but are supranational authorities, so to speak."
"In my opinion, enhanced cooperation in the first pillar should only be envisaged as a last resort. It should be a last resort available after common action has been abandoned, in particular through lack of unanimity."
"As the President of this Parliament has said, it should be the exception to the rule, the means that allows the Union to make progress in certain cases and under strict conditions, even if some States cannot join in this common action or be a part of it immediately."
"But we should not deceive ourselves. Flexibility is not an alternative to qualified majority."
"If enhanced cooperation became the rule, it might shatter the system."
"We should bear in mind that common decisions adopted by qualified majority do in a sense permit all the flexibility needed to take account of different situations in Member States."
"And there is no doubt that maintaining unanimity in certain areas may lead to excessive use of enhanced cooperation, hence the need to lay down strict rules for introducing it."
"Otherwise there is a risk that the IGC will take the line of least resistance and maintain unanimity, heavily restricting the extension of majority voting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union perhaps deserves a separate chapter."
"Assuming that not all the Member States enter monetary union initially, the question is whether a need for enhanced cooperation would exist between the States that are in."
"Opinions are divided on this point, as you already know, and there is a very lively debate about it."
"Some regard the existing provisions as sufficient, because the different policies in each Member State would be adapted, always respecting the acquis communautaire ."
"Others think that some policies, like social or fiscal policy, would require more advanced common provisions for the States that are in."
"Without going into the substance of the debate, the Commission's view is that, in these circumstances, the basic principles it is proposing for enhanced cooperation should in any case be respected."
"Finally, I want to stress that generalized flexibility is certainly not the panacea for all the Union's difficulties."
"In Dublin the European Council stated that decisions in this area, or indeed lack of decision, will have immense significance for the future of the Union."
"So I want to be very clear: flexibility cannot be the only key to our future."
"The fundamental point is for Member States to agree on the objectives of the Union."
"If flexibility is not limited to a precise area and specific decisions but extended to the very objectives of the Union, sooner or later it will lead to fragmentation of the Union."
"And this risk will be all the greater if the social protocol technique is applied to other areas, giving one or more Member States an opt-out from common action on important issues for European integration."
"I will now touch briefly on flexibility in the other two pillars and specifically on common foreign and security policy."
"Technically, flexibility seems simpler in common foreign and security policy and in fact the CFSP basically calls not for regulations which may create permanent differences, but for specific actions and decisions."
"Besides, there are some differences amongst the new Member States as regards their military commitments in defence matters."
"So it is difficult to envisage a Union foreign policy without relying on a certain degree of flexibility."
"But the crucial question is how long differentiation within acts of foreign policy can continue, where a certain number of States do not participate, without provoking a serious crisis in the Union."
"In my opinion it is essential that there should be a high degree of consensus on the common objectives of common foreign and security policy."
"As you know, the Commission is in favour of a more Community-based third pillar."
"Indeed, at yesterday's meeting of Member States' government representatives we specifically examined the question of the third pillar, and that will continue on 10 and 11 February."
"We do think there can be flexibility as regards residual third pillar issues."
"A few words in conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"In our opinion, flexibility is not and should not be the crucial issue at the IGC."
"Options so far considered, proposed by various Member States, are along the same lines."
"The Commission will defend full respect of the Community system, the acquis and the treaty provisions, in accordance with its responsibilities under the treaty."
"But the underlying political problem we have to face today is whether the people of Europe are ready to go forward together in this process of integration, respecting the diversity of the individual States."
"If not, there may be a risk, in an enlarged Union, of some States opting to make progress together outside the Community system."
"That is what worries me the most."
"I believe the success of our integration process depends on the principle of freedom and openness to all who want to join the Union, and we must and can all be capable of going forward together to achieve the common objectives."
"Mr President, I should like to ask Commissioner Oreja his precise view on this: does he think that a general clause on the rule of enhanced cooperation should be inserted into the Treaty, based on but not confined to the clause from which the Franco-German document draws its inspiration?"
"If so, I should like to know whether the Commissioner does not believe that such a clause might turn into a flexibility which would eventually have an impact on the very structure of the Treaty, resulting in an evolution of that Treaty towards an endless proliferation of supplementary agreements, thus weakening its binding force upon all Member States."
"What can be done to prevent this if cooperation becomes a general clause?"
"Protocols already exist, Mr De Giovanni, and it has been impossible to prevent them occurring even in what is probably their most negative form, as in the typical example of the social protocol."
"I think the right approach is to determine the general lines of enhanced cooperation within the framework of the treaty, to the extent that this makes clear exactly which fundamental principles should govern this enhanced cooperation."
"It cannot be an option in all circumstances but must be governed by a set of principles, such as compatibility with the objectives of the Union, respect for the single institutional framework and, of course, preserving the single market and its flanking policies and common policies."
"Unrestrained enhanced cooperation would be inadmissible, and it must be recognized as bounded by precise conditions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the success or failure of the Intergovernmental Conference will depend, largely, upon the progress made in strengthening integration, taking account of the currently negative positions of certain States, positions which look very much like veto."
"The Commission's position seems to me restrictive, and with good reason, since you are setting a very tight framework within which this strengthened integration would have to operate, but this position also seems defensive, as far as its right of initiative in the matter is concerned, which is not such a good thing."
"The Commission is the guardian of the treaties, as you reminded us in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, and you also recalled also that it was guardian of the general interest."
"Could you explain this attitude, which corresponds perhaps to a particularly subtle strategy?"
"Mrs Spaak, I do not know how subtle the initiative is but, yes, I can say that the subject has been debated in the Commission."
"Indeed, I must confess that the first draft of the Commission's proposal located initiative within the Commission itself."
"But in the second draft - the present one, although work is still in progress on it - our view is that initiative should not come from the Commission, precisely because its principle function is to protect the common interest."
"But I want to make two points very clear: initiative comes first from the Member States, the number to be determined, but the Commission will then assess whether or not it is appropriate to start the process."
"So although it does not have first stage initiative, it has a kind of second stage initiative, but I appreciate that this is a controversial issue."
"Secondly, I would say that initiative also lies with the Commission in the sense that it can oppose an initiative taken by a very large number of Member States."
"Suppose 13 Member States take an initiative and present it to the Commission."
"If the Commission decides that it does not conform to the fundamental principles I have mentioned, the Commission can refuse to progress it and start the process."
"Commissioner, Mr. President, a few States on their own cannot represent the Union as a whole."
"What is the minimum number of States necessary to achieve flexibility?"
"If administrative actions are financed via the budget and operational costs via participating States, is there a further need for special actions, plans or costs for non-participating States?"
"On the first question, we have always left the doors open in the Commission - we are debating the matter after all."
"But we offer three options: simple majority of Member States; two-thirds majority - which would be 10 at present; and simple majority associated with a population criterion."
"These are the three options we are examining at the moment."
"In any case, I can tell you that the Commission's general criterion involves a large number of States."
"We have not decided exactly how many, or whether simple majority or qualified majority should apply."
"But we have to avoid a proliferation of options and offers making the number of States which can propose enhanced cooperation very small."
"It seems to us that this contradicts the very principles of the treaty."
"There must be a large number of States."
"In relation to the second issue, financing, we think the administrative costs of cooperation must be borne by the Community budget."
"The operating costs of cooperation should be covered as a function of their nature and form."
"And our current idea is that the Commission should indicate, case by case, which costs should be borne by the Community budget and which should be borne by the participating States."
"This issue was raised the other day in the Committee on Institutional Affairs and we need to go on thinking about it, but, in principle, the Commission's position is that we should distinguish between administrative and operational costs."
"Commissioner, you made a very cryptic reference to the participation of the Parliament - you could have been a bit less cryptic, and simply said consultation of the Parliament."
"Would it not be necessary for a decisive step forward to be taken in this precise area of flexibility in order for it to be said that a flexible initiative by a number of Member States is only possible if a qualified majority in Parliament pronounces in favour of it, so that a Community institution is also able to monitor partisan interests?"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am most grateful to you for describing my attitude as 'sibylline' . I did not know I had that quality, but I am delighted to assume it."
"In our opinion the position as regards Parliament is very clear."
"First, the Community institutions must be involved. Parliament, the Court of Justice and the Commission must be involved."
"Secondly, we think Parliament's involvement should be a function of the subject matter."
"That is, if the subject dealt with in cooperation is actually within the scope of codecision, in other words it is a legislative matter, in that case codecision should apply."
"So in our view, the principle governing the participation of Parliament will depend on the subject matter."
"If it is in the area of simple consultation, Parliament's participation will be that of simple consultation."
"If it is a matter of codecision, it will be codecision."
"In any case, there is no doubt that Parliament should participate in the process."
"On the other hand, I have more doubts about Parliament's initiative by invoking article 138 b. I am sure it would be possible for Parliament to take the initiative and that would then have to be taken into account by the Commission and the various States."
"But I think that initiative as such should lie with the Member States and Parliament, not the Commission."
"But on the question that I think is most important to you, the first part, I want to say unequivocally that Parliament's action should be a function of the content: codecision if it is codecision; simple consultation, if it is simple consultation."
"Commissioner, I too am very disappointed by the somewhat timid position adopted by the Commission and by the statements it has made, especially in reply to the questions asked by other Members."
"I would therefore ask you to confirm why, ultimately, in the document which the Commission has made available to the delegations on this very important matter, in which the Commission has a central role, the Commission maintains that it is not its job to be among the promoters of a request for enhanced cooperation, although this is what is indicated by all the proposals submitted by the other States - Portugal and Italy, for example - and also by the initial German and French proposal."
"And then, Commissioner, there is the role of Parliament: there is not a single word in the Commission document about the role of Parliament, not ex post , but on the role of Parliament in the development and the taking of decisions relating to enhanced cooperation."
"Would you kindly reply to these two questions, clarifying the two non-replies that the Commission has so far seen fit to give?"
"Mr Dell'Alba, at this moment, speaking here in the solemnity of a sitting of Parliament, I am committing the Commission."
"The Commission has produced a document but I am speaking after that text."
"So you can take what I am saying now as written."
"I am committing the Commission, and Parliament's role is therefore as I just described it."
"And I want to assure you that we are still thinking, and I hope we will always go on thinking."
"But we will certainly go on thinking about this issue in the light of representations from governments and the position of the European Parliament."
"As regards your first question on the role of the Commission, Parliament's representations did not include initiative by Commission, but by the Member States, and listening to Parliament's representations was one reason why I personally began to think that perhaps initiative should not lie with the Commission."
"Those representations proposed that initiative should lie with the Member States, and not the Commission."
"And they convinced me."
"I do not want to hide behind anyone, I am just saying I was convinced, because I think the point must at least be taken into account that the Commission should only watch over the common interest, the interests of the whole Community, and not those of a group of Member States."
"But this is certainly a matter we will continue to think about and it is possible the Commission will modify its own criteria in the light of other opinions - those I heard the other day in the Committee on Institutional Affairs were along the lines you just mentioned."
"Would the Commissioner agree with me that, as we move towards a Community of over twenty Member States, flexibility is not just desirable but essential if we are going to survive."
"However, there are three core principles which have to be adhered to if flexibility is to work."
"Firstly, under no circumstances must flexibility affect the existing acquis communautaire ."
"Secondly, flexibility is not appropriate for the existing core policies of the Community, in particular the single market and the flanking policies of the environment, social policy and consumer policy."
"Thirdly, without the single institutional framework, flexibility would not be possible."
"Will the Commission guarantee Parliament that it will join us in insisting on a single institutional framework for any policies that move into the area of flexibility in the future?"
"Mr Martin, I can tell you that this is a clear and unequivocal position."
"There are issues we are still discussing in the Commission. We were discussing this issue before the statement of 28 February, and since then we have maintained this position unequivocally."
"There is a set of principles we believe in almost as a dogma, although I do not like dogma in anything, probably not even in this."
"But some ideas are very clear: first, enhanced cooperation must be compatible with the objectives of the Union and with the acquis communautaire ; secondly, and exactly as you just said, it must clearly respect the single institutional framework; it must preserve the internal market; it must preserve its flanking policies, the common policies; it must be constantly open to all the non-participants whose rights must be fully guaranteed; it must be - and if I did not mention this before, I want to do so now - a last resort."
"I mean, we must place obstacles in the way of flexibility, but we cannot prevent it happening."
"The harmonious development of the Union must not be compromised, distortions in competition must not arise, and, finally, the institutional balance must be respected and - let me underline this especially - citizens' rights must be guaranteed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have just given us your position on the matter of strengthened cooperation, in particular on the first pillar, and if you are not in favour of it, I share totally the opinion of certain of my colleagues, such as Mrs Spaak, on your disinclination in this domain."
"However, do you really think that the Treaty of Maastricht itself has already instituted, in the first pillar, the notion of strengthened cooperation in its creation of a single currency and its decision that only certain States may have access to it?"
"Still, it seems to me that this is accepted perfectly by everyone and that we have not, in so doing, upset the single market."
"You are referring to a specific situation which seems to be provided for in the treaty."
"But we are now discussing whether there should be a general flexibility clause."
"And I do not want to take a sanctimonious position, but I believe in certain ideas."
"At the moment, I think it would be appropriate to have a general clause, and also be specific clauses for the first, second and third pillars."
"But we have gone further as regards the second and third pillars, where the possibility of enhanced cooperation occurring seems entirely reasonable."
"The problem is the first pillar."
"There are clear and unequivocal rules for economic and monetary union, but that is not the problem."
"The problem is that there must be a general clause for the first pillar. My criteria for applying enhanced cooperation in the first pillar are very restrictive."
"I have stated some conditions and they are the conditions accepted by the Commission."
"We will see how the dialogue evolves, including the dialogue with Parliament, and what ideas emerge to enhance cooperation."
"Mr President, the whole subject of flexibility is of course an extension of the whole subject of two speeds."
"That much is gradually becoming obvious."
"Obviously too, it is an area in which both pitfalls and opportunities abound."
"Let me put the following case to the Commissioner."
"Suppose a Commission proposal fails in the Council of Ministers because there is no qualified majority or no unanimity."
"What then happens if a group of ministers finds that the matter can be made into a law or administrative regulation using the expedient of flexibility, because that is of course the objective."
"If something fails to secure unanimity or a qualified majority then this third option of flexibility can be chosen."
"That is the situation as I see it."
"How can the Commission prevent that?"
"My second question is this: how in this context are you going to guarantee Parliament's right of scrutiny?"
"After all people will be quick to say: this is not a question of Community policy; it is an intergovernmental matter since there was neither a qualified majority nor unanimity."
"It seems to me that there are very major dangers in what is being proposed and that the case I have just mentioned perhaps rules out the idea that the Commission should not have a right of initiative."
"I am trying to explain my thinking clearly, but that does not mean I might not change my mind in the light of the different views expressed here and at other meetings I attend."
"On the first part of Mrs Maij-Weggen's question, about a proposal being rejected by qualified majority, that cannot happen when the initiative comes from the Member States."
"If the initiative comes from the Member States and the Commission adopts it and presents it, it already has a majority."
"So her hypothesis is not possible under the formula I have put forward here."
"It would be possible if the Commission took the initiative, but not if the initiative is taken by the Member States."
"On the exercise of parliamentary control, I want to say something I have not said before, which is that during the debate on the participation of the institutions in enhanced cooperation, the Commission's criterion has been that, in the case of the Council, it is representatives of the States that have agreed on this enhanced cooperation who will be present."
"But the Commission, the Court of Justice and Parliament should intervene as institutions as a whole, regardless of which States participate."
"This criterion strikes us as absolutely logical, although I appreciate that it is a matter for discussion."
"But we think Parliament as a whole should participate in enhanced cooperation, because we regard it as indivisible."
"The same applies to the Commission and the Court of Justice."
"Commissioner, your remarks, far from dispelling the scepticism that I feel about flexibility, have actually reinforced it."
"I can't help wondering - aren't we talking at such length about flexibility to prevent another area of the debate from going by the board, the area that relates to the democratization of the institutional structure?"
"I am increasingly forming the impression that we are talking less and less about ways in which we can bring greater democracy to our institutions and more and more about what we can do to help ensure that things can be handled flexibly."
"What the position of the European Parliament is going to be is still not at all clear to me, despite what you have said."
"I should like to ask you - assuming that flexibility is going to be resolved upon at all in exceptional cases - what guarantee there is going to be that the prerogatives of the European Parliament are respected."
"And another question too: what do you actually expect the effects on the legal structure to be if, in a number of areas of communitization, individual States can move forward and the European Parliament and the institutions in general can no longer keep pace, so that the controlling function which we must exercise becomes impossible?"
"I want to stress that flexibility is not a normal situation in Community life."
"You say there are doubts and vacillations."
"Naturally there are, and I have many."
"Everything is simple when all the States act together."
"Enhanced cooperation is characterized by abnormality."
"That is clearly established and institutionalized in the treaty as regards economic and monetary union."
"But at the moment the idea of enhanced cooperation is open to the four winds."
"And it is a difficult formula where the truth is hard to grasp."
"We need to deal with it so that everyone knows - as David Martin said earlier - that we fundamentally guarantee the single institutional framework and the acquis communautaire , which we must preserve above all else."
"But one thing has been clearly stated in the Intergovernmental Conference, and it is that enhanced cooperation is going to happen."
"If it does not happen inside the treaty, it will happen outside it, and we have to choose. Do we prefer trying to keep the problems of enhanced cooperation inside the treaty, or leaving it to roam free outside the treaty?"
"I prefer inside, but maybe you prefer outside."
"I would rather keep it inside the treaty and lay down some very clear rules for it."
"And in this connection I have mentioned some principles which I think are sufficiently clear and unequivocal, requiring enhanced cooperation to be compatible with the objectives of the Union and with the acquis communautaire ."
"So it cannot be just any type of enhanced cooperation."
"I have said that the single institutional framework and all the principles that derive from it must be respected, and that a set of rules, those of the internal market for example, must be maintained."
"That means enhanced cooperation has no place where the internal market and the flanking policies are concerned."
"And there is no vacillation there."
"Other issues need to be discussed."
"One of them is how Parliament should participate, and we hope Parliament itself will give us some ideas on this."
"I have already traced out some routes, one in particular, which is that the form of Parliament's participation should depend on the nature of the action."
"If it is a legislative issue, Parliament should participate through codecision and would consequently have full rights to act jointly with the States involved in enhanced cooperation, with equal legal status."
"Mr. President, Commissioner, my first question concerns whether or not there is a risk that the cooperation between those countries wishing to move on quickly and those which feel that we are moving forward too fast will break down, and that a move to a more flexible form of working, in which the right of veto is effectively removed, will damage the close cooperation which we currently enjoy."
"My initial concern is in the areas of Foreign policy and Security policy but my concern extends beyond these areas to areas such as Tax policy and those such as Finance policy, which will arise as a result of EMU."
"My second question, Commissioner, is: will this not create walls between the smaller countries, new members and applicant countries, those which may not be able to belong to the inner core for some time, and the larger, long-term members of the Union?"
"Then I have a third question, if it is possible to answer this. Who will decide when flexibility is applicable?"
"Will this also be determined by means of a flexible decision?"
"Obviously the risk of division exists."
"But we have already had to face that risk."
"If the issue of flexibility is not resolved inside the treaty, there is no doubt that flexibility will exist outside the treaty."
"And the reality at this very moment is that various forms of flexibility are occurring in the area of the second pillar and, of course, in the area of the third pillar."
"Take Schengen, for example."
"Schengen is probably the most symptomatic case of what flexibility outside the treaty means."
"It is operating outside the treaty because the rule inside was unanimity, and consequently the opposition of one State forced the others, which wanted this form of cooperation, to apply it outside the treaty."
"I think that is the wrong procedure."
"We must try to bring Schengen inside the treaty and that is why we now need to adopt a set of rules to guarantee all the fundamental principles I referred to earlier."
"Mr President, Commissioner Oreja has presented flexibility to us from one particular angle, solely as a means of moving still further towards integration."
"This is one possibility, of course, but flexibility is a multiform concept which involves many other facets."
"Flexibility could in particular aid the expansion of the European Union towards the East, an expansion which is precisely one of the priorities of the Intergovernmental Conference and to which we must give particular commitment."
"My question is as follows: how, according to Commissioner Oreja, could flexibility work in relation to expansion towards the East, and in particular, would we not avoid many problems if we did not try, in this particular case, to impose all of the policies of the European Union at the same time, universally, upon all of the new candidate countries?"
"Mr President, does improving the effectiveness of cooperation and increasing flexibility mean that there is a wish to give more power to the large Member States, as appears from the statements of some Commissioners?"
"It has been proposed that France, Germany and the UK inter alia, be given the right of veto."
"Does this proposal have wider support within the Commission?"
"This is a matter which affects what is called 'the decisionmaking system' and the way the votes are weighted."
"I do not see that it needs changing, except to adjust to the circumstance of a larger number of countries."
"The Commission's unequivocal position is that the unanimity rule should disappear, and that is being debated in the IGC."
"It would be a highly significant achievement if the Intergovernmental Conference could restrict unanimity entirely to constitutional or quasi-constitutional issues, and extend qualified majority voting."
"This must be one of the most important battles the Commission, at least, is fighting in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And I would almost say that what happens at the European Council in Amsterdam will depend on how far the qualified majority principle is extended."
"That means unanimity would largely disappear and with it the right of veto, not just for large States but for small ones too."
"We want the European Union to be efficient and free from bureaucracy."
"I have a very practical question which I hope you will allow me to put."
"In the European Union we have a growing number of Asian business people, many of whom have for long periods lived in Europe or were born here."
"Their familiarity with the cultures and the businesses of both Europe and the Indian subcontinent are valuable in helping to promote trade to our mutual benefit."
"However, current import procedures are creating problems."
"I have recently been approached by an Indian businessman in my West London constituency who was refused permission to import fashion nightwear from India."
"In principle I am not against the idea of quotas but the classification system used for imported goods drawn up by the Commission and implemented by national customs authorities are inadequate and outdated."
"My constituent was refused an import licence because he was told there was no category for nightshirts and his goods must be described as blouses for which the quota was used up."
"I have an example here and I should like to ask the Commissioner and the lady Members if they would regard that as a blouse and would be prepared to wear it in the street or in this House?"
"Will the Commission agree to conduct an urgent review of the classification used for imported goods under the quota requirements and bring them up to date?"
"The Commissioner will not answer that question because it is not related to the matters on the agenda and we must respect a rule we have agreed amongst ourselves."
"I noticed that in his opening contribution, the Commissioner expressed his anxiety to ensure that he should not give a list of areas of flexibility for the first pillar although he did single out for particular reference economic and monetary union."
"I do not know whether the Commissioner's remark on flexibility and EMU signals a view on the part of the Commission as a college about whether this would be a desirable development or not."
"I am aware that opinion among Member States is divided on the matter."
"What is the Commission's opinion on the desirability or otherwise of increased flexible cooperation in EMU for participating states in the third stage with regard to fiscal and social policy initiatives?"
"I think there are two parts to your question."
"The first part is about lists, and I have already said that the Commission is not in favour of lists, not a positive list, in any case."
"We are not in favour of a negative list either, although we could perhaps be said to be more sympathetic to the idea of excluding certain subjects."
"We think a set of criteria, which I have listed here, is preferable."
"Any initiative must meet these criteria and, consequently, the Commission would not accept Member States' initiatives if they did not comply with these principles."
"On your other point, I cannot give the position of the College of Commissioners because it has not yet adopted one."
"But it is a central issue which the Commission is thinking about."
"Is it possible to consider certain enhanced cooperation formulae in the framework of economic and monetary union?"
"This enhanced cooperation would in any case have to respect the fundamental principles and rules I mentioned earlier."
"For example, if there were a range of taxes with a maximum and a minimum, would there be any difficulty for countries involved in enhanced cooperation reaching agreement on the minimum?"
"I do not think there would be any difficulty."
"It would not be against the Treaty."
"The problem would arise if the minimum were outside the range."
"This is one of the subjects relating to taxes, and also to the social area, currently under discussion and we have not yet concluded our deliberations."
"Thank you very much, Mr Oreja."
"I think that exchange of views has been very fruitful."
"Fight against racism"
"The next item is the annual debate on the oral questions B4-1229/96, to the Council, and B41230/96, to the Commission, by Mr Ford and Mr Oostlander, on behalf ot the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the fight against racism."
"Mr President, racism and xenophobia are totally at odds with the principles on which the ideal of European integration is based."
"We seek to unite peoples and to create greater harmony in European society on a basis of mutual trust and solidarity.  ºNo more nationalism' was the logical reaction after we had conquered national socialism."
"So the European Union has an ambition, deeply rooted though limited in scope, to combat the cross-border aspects of racism and xenophobia and to take the measures required at European level for effective national, regional and local policy."
"The real work has to be done at grass-roots level."
"We thus think the best possible support should be given to social and church organizations Europe-wide which really reach the widest of all circles and are able in their way to offer a solid base from which to fight racism and xenophobia."
"Such a broad-based approach is necessary."
"Evil and deception are a threat everywhere."
"To pinpoint them as being in one particular part or parts of this House or in certain nasty little parties is to miss the seriousness of the matter."
"Self-criticism is a good thing in any movement and moral judgments which block the way to selfcriticism are thus ethically very dubious or at best worthless."
"We can leave it to the criminal law to deal with these nasty little parties."
"Self-criticism should also be practised by governments and Member States and by the Council of European Ministers."
"It is too ridiculous that in this year against racism and xenophobia, Member States and Council should agree unashamedly to the partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines, that is to say for reasons of Realpolitik , and decline to arrest racist mass murderers."
"In short, this European Year is not a nice little opportunity for individuals, parties or governments to portray themselves in a good light."
"The Year will only achieve anything if the pain of racism and xenophobia is understood and serious priority is given to tackling them."
"And any measures taken must look to the future."
"Two points here."
"Firstly, education."
"Those in charge must be able to devise reading materials and to exchange expertise and experience on the subject with colleagues elsewhere in the Union."
"Secondly, we must realize that long-term neglect of policy to integrate immigrants today will lead to tensions tomorrow."
"It is alarming, some time afterwards, to see how easily fellow human beings were regarded simply as economically convenient guest workers."
"Racism and xenophobia are to a large extent avoidable."
"What we have to do is make this European Year a year of active integration and reciprocal adjustment."
"The UK Government used its veto today against a Union basis for the Observatory proposed by the Kahn Committee which is designed to support the network of existing research bodies studying the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia and help us compare the effectiveness of policy measures which might be helpful."
"This veto is a serious but not invincible obstacle."
"I think that if the UK Government does not review its position or does not do so in the near future the Commission's services can be used creatively in such a way that there is nevertheless room under the present framework for the Commission to help the network of existing research bodies."
"In the Kahn Committee Mr Ford and I did our very best, for these reasons, to argue that existing projects of the European Community should be used to further the aim of countering racism and xenophobia, just as we often do with projects concerned with education, culture and media and the cause of equality between the sexes."
"In this way, in cases where the Council may possibly find its hands tied by a veto - this by way of a challenge here - we shall look to the Commission even more to make full use of the powers and creativity it already has."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to express my thanks to Mr Oostlander and Minister Dijkstal for their support for our Year Against Racism."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has scheduled its annual debate at the beginning of our European Year."
"The interest and involvement of the Parliament has, of course, been very crucial and it is largely because of the constant attention that the Parliament has paid to this issue over the years that the decision was taken to have 1997 named as the European Year Against Racism."
"Your question gives me an opportunity to keep you informed of recent developments and indicate how we have responded to the various requests and suggestions that we have received."
"I would first of all like to talk about the IGC and the possible insertion of a provision which prohibits discrimination into the Treaty on European Union."
"The Commission has given its opinion on this issue and has pressed for such a provision to be inserted. You can be assured that we will make our point of view very strongly known to the Dutch presidency, who now have the difficult task of finalizing the IGC negotiations in a satisfactory manner."
"I am very pleased to see Minister Dijkstal here today and to know that he has already indicated on 20th January to the Civil Liberties Committee he would be following the aim as set out in the Irish presidency text."
"As we have heard, tomorrow is the start of the European Year Against Racism."
"There will be an opening conference in the Hague which will be attended by the President of Parliament, Mr Santer and the Dutch Prime Minister."
"I know that many of the Members of Parliament will be present at the meeting and will make a very significant contribution to the occasion."
"Most of the responsibility to tackle racism lies with the Member States but this year is an exercise in partnership and we will further establish our relations with key partners, such as the non-governmental organizations."
"One way of cooperating is through funding of projects."
"There will be a call for projects that will be launched very soon and this call for projects will be published in the information newsletter of the Year."
"This will indicate the organizations which are eligible for funding, the criteria of the projects, the deadlines and the available budget."
"Other partners include the ad-hoc committee, consisting of representatives of governments, and the NGOs who work in the area of combatting racism."
"Then there is the think tank of independent experts who provide us with the ideas."
"We have gathered suggestions from both of these groups, some of which coincide with proposals that you have made in your resolution."
"One of the main ideas to come out of our think tank so far is to try to correct the unjustified, negative perception of ethnic minorities and immigrants by some people."
"The reality is, of course, that ethnic minorities and immigrants make a very positive contribution to European society but too little attention is paid to this."
"We must now speak about it more."
"I have asked for a specific report on this subject which will be the basis of one of the workshops at the opening conference during the week."
"Turning now to the other aspects of your resolution, I can say that there will be a round table on a variety of issues and there will certainly be a media campaign."
"We will arrange for a video to be produced and made available to a range of television stations and at the opening conference there will be two exhibitions: one on the positive contribution ethnic minorities have made and are making to British society and one about the portrayal of ethnic minorities in the media and advertising."
"One of the ideas which came out of both the ad-hoc committee and the think tank is to have a seminar on training the judiciary."
"We are looking into this."
"As concerns the Monitoring Committee for Racism and Xenophobia referred to in the debate, the Commission made a proposal for a Council Regulation on 27th November last year and the Dublin Council called for the adoption under the Dutch presidency."
"Minister Dijkstal has told Parliament he thinks this is a subject which should be dealt with now positively."
"We will continue to press for the rapid adoption of the proposal."
"I hope that Parliament will be able to give its opinion rapidly but, as you all know, there is still one Member State which queries the legal base of this important proposal."
"As yet the matter is not finally decided and I am very encouraged by what the Minister says that perhaps the British will still come on board."
"In conclusion, I am very satisfied with the way the Year is progressing."
"The campaign forms part of our shared efforts to build a true citizens' Europe: Member States, NGOs and the other key actors and, of course, the Commission are very enthusiastic and working hard to make this Year a real success and to ensure that it will also have significant effects, not just this year, but in the years to come."
"I hope that the Year will not only serve to demonstrate the added value of European action but also as a springboard for further action in later years."
"I know that the European Parliament will play its part with its own activities and events and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and the Members of the House for the great support they have given to all of us in this Year and in all matters relating to the threat against freedoms posed by racism."
"Mr President, measures against intolerance are enjoying a high profile."
"Today we are holding our annual debate here on the fight against racism and xenophobia, whilst tomorrow in The Hague the European Year Against Racism will be officially inaugurated."
"It is heartening to see initiatives being taken on many fronts in Europe against intolerance and racism."
"Schools exchanging courses on a multicultural society."
"Trade unions taking up the fight against racism at work."
"Internet groups being alert to the spread of racist material through the new media."
"All this illustrates the fact that people in Europe are not prepared to put up with racism and xenophobia."
"Against that background it is inappropriate and incomprehensible that the British Government should be putting up one obstacle after another to stop a European Observatory from getting off the ground."
"Inappropriate vis √† vis all those individuals and groups which are fighting with might and main against the evil which is racism and who expect the political world to make an ongoing contribution to that fight."
"Incomprehensible because John Major was in favour of an Observatory both at the Dublin summit and the one in Florence."
"Incomprehensible too because in 1986 - and I was there - the British Government signed the solemn declaration which the Council, Commission and European Parliament all gave to combat racism at both national and European levels."
"I am sure you recall that solemn declaration of 1986, Minister Dijkstal."
"Peace, democracy, the combating of fascism and racism, never again another Auschwitz, these were the roots of European unification, as you said."
"So it is indeed inconceivable that John Major should wish to keep that message from his people."
"If he does, despite our best hopes, we are confident that a later incoming government will immediately reverse that decision."
"Auschwitz was remembered last week in a number of Member States."
"European agreements were proposed which would make revisionism an offence."
"In Germany it is already an offence to deny the reality of Auschwitz."
"I would urge the Dutch presidency to put forward proposals for European legislation in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on racism and xenophobia is indubitably an absolutely necessary one."
"I should like to take advantage of this debate to say something specifically about xenophobia."
"It is not enough just to hold a debate and demonstrate that this phenomenon exists."
"I believe we must become more involved, we must hunt down the causes of xenophobia and then, once we have identified the causes, take swift counter-measures."
"We know the causes of xenophobia. To some extent, they lie in the fact that we have unsolved problems in the asylum legislation of the individual Member States, such as excessively slow procedures, and that we are not sufficiently willing to share the burden when it comes to refugees from war zones."
"Think back to the year 1991-2, when Germany and Austria were particularly affected by that."
"Think back to the lack of control mechanisms for migrant workers, which can ultimately result in concern about the loss of jobs."
"Let me remind the House of the problems of the integration measures, which are certainly inadequate."
"And let me remind it, too, that on a great many occasions a very rapid increase in the number of applications for asylum is apparent."
"Just two figures are sufficient to show how rapidly things have changed here - in 1985 there were 159, 000 applications for asylum and in 1992 there were 674, 000."
"Another cause, as I see it, is that sources of conflict, are imported as a result of excessive immigration, where what happens is that disputes which normally take place in the immigrants' home countries are transplanted into the countries to which they have migrated, and of course these migratory movements are also exploited by organized crime."
"So we know plenty of the causes."
"And we know that they give rise to anxieties, and ultimately to xenophobia."
"So what we should do is take swift action to combat those causes."
"Let me suggest a few, then: first, we should strive for Community-wide regulations in asylum policy and visa policy."
"Secondly, we should try to harmonize the situation where migrant workers are concerned, and thirdly we should endeavour to arrange for the the burden to be evenly shared if we have another influx of refugees from a war zone."
"The fourth point is the common monitoring of the external frontiers, and the fifth is measures for combating organized crime because in that area the blame is constantly being put on the wrong people."
"I should be glad if the observatory could in fact be set up to keep an eye on things in Europe."
"If we succeed in identifying these causes and taking the appropriate action, then we shall have laid the ground work for ensuring that we have less xenophobia in future, and perhaps even none at all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the work undertaken by the Committee on Civil Liberties and the close attention being paid to a subject - the subject of racism and xenophobia - which is becoming more and more topical leave no room for doubt."
"The campaign against all forms of racism and xenophobia must be waged with determination and vigour, and a response made by this Parliament must be nothing less than dignified and high-minded."
"But what I fear is that, after the declarations of intent and statements of principle, the danger is that we shall eventually be left with nothing but the usual rhetoric."
"Let us begin by making one point clear: over the course of history, migration has always been a source of benefits, a catalyst for change, and today we are moving more and more towards a desirable melting pot of different cultures."
"Obviously, the immigration question is the central issue used to conceal all the causes of racism and xenophobia, and it is to that issue that all the attention of Europe's governments must be turned."
"But I do not believe that the declarations of principle made under the auspices of the European Year against Racism, still less - I am sorry to say - the as yet unclear objective of the Observatory, which clearly runs the risk of wasting the tax-payer's money without any clear objectives, can be the solution to our problem."
"I will therefore say loud and clear, as regards the efforts made by Mr Ford and Mr Oostlander of the Civil Liberties Committee, that I fully endorse all the proposals they have made, though I am less happy about the penalties."
"The only real response to racism and xenophobia today is to understand that this collection of cultures is an expression of civilization, that this diversity of traditions is a positive and enriching factor for Europe."
"The suppression of racist and xenophobic demonstrations risks producing the opposite effect: it is likely to be counterproductive, to drive the racist and xenophobic movements underground."
"This is an aspect that should receive careful consideration from this Parliament and from all those whose aim is to defend liberty and democracy in Europe and throughout the world."
"Finally, I should add that the reference to the parties of the extreme Right, or the Right in general, is a misguided reference because this Parliament must oppose all forms of extremism and all forms of intolerance."
"Woe betide us if we fail to do so!"
"Mr. President, when the Allied Forces opened the gates of Auschwitz, the whole world saw the depths to which racist insanity could drag us."
"This was a harsh and disturbing, but extremely significant revelation."
"As a consequence of the holocaust, there was a long period of time during which antisemitism and all forms of racism, such as racist humour and speech were taboo amongst thinking people."
"For decades, any sign of this type of behaviour was unusual in schools, organisations and gatherings of any kind. However, this has changed in recent years."
"These days it is not so uncommon for pupils, usually with short cropped hair and army boots, to come to school wearing their swastikas and to shout their racist and xenophobic views."
"Many teachers do not know how to deal with such situations. They have no idea what to do or say."
"There is also great uncertainty amongst head teachers and school governing bodies."
"Leaders in sporting organisations have the same problem when they are openly confronted by leering scornful racists."
"Antisemitism, racism and xenophobia are not in decline in Europe."
"On the contrary, this type of behaviour is increasing."
"This is why, Mr. President, finding the appropriate way to confront and halt the increase in this behaviour is such an important task for the European Union."
"We have spoken about a centre against racism, but this is not enough."
"We need to establish a number of locations throughout the European Union where education can be provided, where teachers, sports leaders and others can find out what racism really means, what its origins are, what behaviour it induces and what can be done to confront those who openly demonstrate their belief in this heresy."
"We must attack this behaviour and one way of doing so is by drawing up a programme for the whole of Europe, which will remove this evil from our society."
"Mr President, first I want to express my appreciation of the fine resolution in this annual debate on racism and xenophobia."
"This debate and resolution come at a time when very disturbing statements are being made inside the European Union and feeding a climate of suspicion of asylum seekers and immigrants from third countries."
"Linking immigration directly with social problems and proposals for tougher national legislation are two good examples of that climate of suspicion."
"But I want to make this speech positive because I think the declaration of 1997 as European Year against Racism and Xenophobia is a step forward - a small one, but a step forward."
"In my group we believe the success of this initiative should be accompanied by an Intergovernmental Conference decision to make asylum policies and instruments for the prevention of racism and xenophobia Community issues, with the aim of adopting an anti-discrimination directive as soon as possible, jointly drafted by the Council, the Commission and, of course, the European Parliament."
"I did not want to let this opportunity pass without welcoming the Council's decision to create an Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia which will undoubtedly contribute to better analysis of racist and xenophobic phenomena and their causes, and to effective exchange of experiences and information."
"Finally, I would like to underline the fact that our group worked successfully to include in the text of the resolution the statement that 'the notion of race has no scientific, genetic or anthropological basis' and can only serve to underpin discrimination and racism."
"We believe the term should never be used in official texts, and we have tabled an amendment along those lines which I trust you will support."
"Mr President, Mr Flynn, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against Racism and Xenophobia is important - or rather, it could be important if it were to be made clear that the European Union is finally facing up to its responsibilities and not just making pretty speeches but actually embarking upon political, legal and financial initiatives; and if the EU demonstrates its willingness to be generous in its support of the many existing proposals and projects by non-governmental organizations."
"But this is where I start to have doubts."
"Because it is simply not the case that the European Union has put up ECU 4.7 million of its own money for the Year against Racism."
"No, it dipped into the existing kitty, at the expense of its ongoing activities, as it were."
"A second problem is the lack of transparency in the provision of aid and the allocation of resources, and the power complex that makes it so very, very difficult for smaller projects to be successful."
"Much more serious, though, in my view are the political questions."
"How can it be possible, Mr Flynn, that the national coordinating authorities in the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark are headed by, of all people, the national ministers responsible for home affairs - the very people who, at Council level, have done everything but promote a genuine policy of integration, in your own words, Commissioner, who have done nothing to establish real anti-discrimination or the validity of the democratic principle of equal rights for all, but who have done a great deal more to intensify the system that divides people up into different classes?"
"A policy against racism means an end to campaigns against refugees, against immigrants!"
"A policy against racism means not conducting campaigns of abuse but guaranteeing the exercise of rights, such as the right to asylum, the right to a family, the right to freedom of movement, the right to vote."
"Only when every form of institutional discrimination and institutional racism has been done away with - only then will there be credibility."
"That, then, is the basic essential for combating racism and violence in the Union."
"But the reality is very different. For example, the German Minister for the Interior marked the start of this European Year against Racism by introducing compulsory visas and residence permits for children from the traditional applicant countries."
"That rule affects 800, 000 children - unaccompanied refugee children, but also children of people who are living among us, people who are immigrants!"
"Now they are becoming the victims of an irresponsible policy which is harmful to integration."
"We must oppose this."
"We support you, Mr Flynn, but what we certainly do not support is the argument advanced by Mr Pirker, who stands up here and puts the blame for racism on the actual victims, the refugees, the immigrants!"
"Mr Pirker, racism is our problem, not the problem of those who are attacked and whose homes are burned!"
"And who bears the blame for racism against handicapped people, homosexuals, lesbians, the old, black people?"
"That is our problem, not the problem of the victims!"
"Mr President, it is difficult to be against the report which is being presented to us today, because it does indeed flow along with the best sentiments in the world."
"At most one might make the criticism that it is completely politically correct and that it is also, slightly, an accumulation of principles which are of little consequence."
"Of course, during this year, all of our colleagues will put their best efforts into initiating or developing positive activities to combat racism, anti-semitism, that detestable stupidity which we even come across here at times."
"That goes without saying."
"But we can however be a little more reserved when it comes to one particular point, one of importance though, in the resolution being proposed to us."
"This is the creation of the European monitoring centre."
"Previous ones, monitoring centres that is - I am thinking in particular of our monitoring centre on drug abuse, located in Lisbon - have not up to now brought about substantial results nor really perceptible advances in the domains to which they relate."
"To come back to racism, everyone knows the huge number of public and private committees, organisations and associations which are increasing the number of initiatives concerning the fight against racism on a national and international scale, including the European Council and its admirable campaign, which it developed last year."
"Clearly some icing can be added to this multi-layer cake."
"But I am not at all sure that such a creation will attenuate substantially the attitude of European citizens when they are tempted by mindless aggression towards Jews, Arabs, Asians and foreigners in general."
"I am rather afraid that it would turn out to be a new structure of baubles, bangles, beads and civil servants, expensive, reassuring for us, but whose effectiveness cannot be guaranteed."
"Anyway, a number of us within the group are asking this question with a great deal of wisdom."
"Mr President, as the previous speaker said, the fight against racism is one of the devices of political correctness today."
"Only, the danger with politically correct ideas is that they are likely to end up attacking freedom of opinion and expression and resulting in thought policing."
"Indeed, under cover of the fight against racism, certain people, in the so-called anti-racist lobbies, are trying to wipe out certain opinions and expressions."
"Any defence of national identity could therefore be prohibited."
"Similarly, all critical expression on immigration becomes difficult, likely even to result in an appearance in court."
"Similarly, defence of the natural principle of national or community preference can also find itself being pursued, condemned, in the name of political correctness, in the name of the thought police."
"Well, in these seats, we are delighted with the fact that, during the last few weeks, these thought police have suffered a setback with the debate which has begun in the Federal Republic of Germany on the question of immigration and the link between immigration and unemployment."
"Until now this was thought to be politically incorrect."
"Well anyway, a debate has begun in a major country on this subject."
"I would like to set some little puzzles, to enlighten our Assembly."
"Who said: ' We can no longer accept that millions of our fellow citizens are unemployed while hundreds and thousands of work permits are given to foreign workers every year' ?"
"It was not Jean-Marie Le Pen who said it, it was the leader of the CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag."
"Who put forward a proposal aiming to prohibit foreigners from countries outside the European Union from working during the first five years of their stay?"
"It was not a deputy from the National Front, it was two German parliamentarians, Christian Democrats, from the Bundestag."
"Who said: ' We are faced with the problem of massive unemployment among nationals and yet we employ many foreigners."
"It should be legitimate to think about how we can allow nationals into existing jobs' ?"
"This was not a deputy or a head of the National Front or a sister movement either, it was the Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Who said: ' It is absurd that so many jobs are occupied by foreigners."
"This situation cannot continue."
"How can we explain to national workers that with high unemployment, hundreds of thousands of foreigners can work' ?"
"It was not Jean-Marie Le Pen who said that, it was Chancellor Kohl."
"I could give many more examples like these, and even some different ones."
"Who said: ' I think we should establish quotas within the framework of a law on immigration to relieve the national employment market and nip the social explosion in the bud' ?"
"This was not a deputy from the National Front, the Vlaams blok or another sister grouping either, it was Klaus Zwickel, chairman of the big trade union IG-Mettall."
"Anyway, I think these statements should make you think."
"They show that the problem of immigration and unemployment is out in the open today, that there is a link between the two, and I think that the Commission, instead of following the twaddle of anti-racism, should concern itself with the extension and opening up of our legislation to national and community preference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before we continue with the debate, I wish to inform you that I have received a motion for a resolution tabled under paragraph 5 of article 40 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, thursday, at 11.00 a.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just been treated to a classic example of the rabble-rousing abilities of the far Right."
"It is certainly true that Mr Le Gallou, in the presence of his lord and master, has been industriously treating us to quotations from the Federal Republic of Germany."
"Those quotations reveal one thing: to compare the people you quoted with people like you would be an insult to them."
"But you are right about one thing: racism and xenophobia do not flourish only on the right-hand margin of society."
"There is a very great danger that they will flourish in the centre too."
"And that is why it is a duty for political people, the political leadership of countries and the political leadership of the European Union, to be so careful in their choice of words and in their own behaviour that no doubts can arise."
"Those who bear the responsibility for their peoples and for the European Union must make it clear in their own behaviour: in what I say, in what I do, in my acts, in the entire impression I give, there is one principle that can never be doubted: I am in favour of equality for the entire human race!"
"I denounce anyone who is a racist!"
"I denounce anyone who is a xenophobe!"
"I say you won't find any antisemitism in me!"
"If you express yourself like that, then, whether you come from the Right or the Left, you make it clear to the people that the leaders of our people, those in the highest positions in our governments, actually do the things they advocate in their fine declarations - they themselves actually set an example of what they ask us to do and what they try to sell."
"That would be an important step, and sometimes people slip up in this area, as the quotations you have just given us demonstrate."
"There is no natural principle of national preference."
"Such rubbish has to be exposed!"
"There is a natural principle that all men, and all nation states, are equal, and national preference is a figment of the nineteenth century!"
"A natural principle of national preference is a battle cry, intended to place people on a particular level - so that those who have a particular nationality are supposed to be raised to a higher level than all those who do not have that nationality!"
"That is the starting point for the oppressive society which people like you, Mr Le Gallou, want to see throughout Europe, but which we do not, which is why we have set up an opposing platform in this Year against Racism and Xenophobia!"
"And that theory is this: Europe has economic problems, Europe has worries about the future, without any doubt, Europe is under pressure from immigration and has problems with the distribution of its own wealth, but Europe has a future in front of it if we in the Council and the Commission and this House want it, by which I mean that we will solve these problems without making other, innocent third parties scapegoats for the fact that we have to solve our own problems!"
"That must be our view of things!"
"And when we achieve that, then we will get rid of people like you from this Parliament!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we see racism and xenophobia every day, in every conceivable form, and not just among extremist political groups."
"That is why the war against racism must be fought everywhere, beginning in early childhood."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media I should like to argue in favour of seeing integration programmes play a more important part in our school syllabuses and becoming a declared objective of education."
"Children must learn at a very early age to treat other cultures and traditions with tolerance."
"We must make it clear to them that there is no place here for arrogance."
"Especially in view of certain radical trends that are becoming part of the political scene in some countries, it is urgently necessary that children should learn that this way of thinking is no part of our common heritage and that foreign cultures can offer us a great deal in the way of enrichment."
"Of course, something is already being done along those lines in our schools, but I think that more is needed - especially as regards the involvement of new technologies, which provide incredible opportunities to promote direct exchanges and become familiar with other ways of thinking."
"Parental education, too, seems to me a very important subject here, because the responsibility should be shared by the whole family."
"The European Year against Racism, which will be formally launched tomorrow, is a good and encouraging initiative."
"We must take active advantage of it, and make it clear that every day must be a day against racism."
"In conclusion, though, I should like to point out that, regrettably, there are still no application forms for project proposals for the European Year, and I have already received many inquiries from German citizens complaining about this."
"They rightly feel that they have been sidelined - because of a lack of organization by the EU they have not yet been able to put forward their ideas and projects, although the Year has already begun."
"Mr President, this motion rightly points out that one of the main raisons d'√™tre of the Union is to prevent racism and xenophobia."
"Racial harmony is in decline and xenophobia, sometimes encouraged by government policies and institutional structures, is on the increase."
"The European Year Against Racism could hardly have come at a more apposite time."
"Experience from my own Member State shows that the attitude of Governments is crucial."
"If responsibility for policing immigrants is contracted out from the state, to airlines or to employers for example, then public policy loses its force, policing is unaccountable and a climate of suspicion is fostered."
"If we do not encourage the recruitment of ethnic minorities and women, a white male police force will remain susceptible to the cancer of racial prejudice."
"If we tolerate unemployment and exclusion among the young, we establish a breeding ground for intolerance."
"Other Members of this House will see similar phenomena in their own countries."
"We must use this year to develop pan-European awareness of and solidarity against racial prejudice."
"Member States must adopt the Year enthusiastically and devote adequate resources to it."
"We need also to establish the European Observatory for Racism and Xenophobia within the democratic framework of the Treaty of Rome."
"If other Governments in the Council of Ministers bow to the demands of an increasingly authoritarian and antiEuropean British Government, they will be offering Europe's citizens a second-rate deal."
"I say to Mr Dijkstal, as a fellow Liberal, do not allow the Union to be dragged down the dangerous, undemocratic road of the British Government."
"In my constituency we are already working hard to make this Year a success."
"I know that citizens are across the Union and many of our people now realise that we cannot afford to delay decisive action."
"Mr President, (start without microphone) and yourself do not have the monopoly on infamy."
"Even if a vile idea were voted in by an overwhelming majority, it would not be the more legitimate for it."
"That is why the European Year Against Racism, which opens tomorrow in The Hague, seems more necessary than ever."
"Necessary because racism continues to thrive."
"Yes, sometimes violently, but also below the surface and insidiously, penetrating everyday life and with progressive banalisation from discourse and behaviour to racist and xenophobic connotations in opinion."
"How can we not denounce the hypocrisy and duplicity of governments who participate in the very organisation of this European Year Against Racism, while they make decisions which continue to fuel racism."
"Examples of this, sadly, are many: Council declarations on community preference regarding employment, statements by German political leaders making direct links between immigration and unemployment, not forgetting, of course, the French government's scandalous draft legislation on immigration which aggravates the Pasqua laws and looks to encourage a climate of suspicion towards foreigners."
"These are the words, these words, which arm racists."
"Racism is fuelled by crisis and its aftermath of exclusion."
"The priority is, then, to combat the sickness at the root, by giving priority to employment."
"But what is also required is an overall policy which is vigorous and coherent, in particular in areas relating to everyday life."
"It is there that the symbolic violence is played out which has tragic consequences for the individuals who are its silent victims."
"We must equip ourselves with new and more effective arms for combatting ordinary everyday racism, favouring three axes: the legal system, education and the media."
"In the legal system, sanctions against all acts of racism and racist remarks, and against the diffusion of negationist theories, should be implemented or strengthened."
"Priority must be given to active policies for education and youth, stressing respect for others and tolerance, following the example of St-Exup√©ry who declared: ' if you are different from me, far from taking from me, you enrich me' ."
"We must also remove the word 'race' from our discourse."
"But my friend spoke about this at length earlier."
"Third axis: the media."
"My group, which approves the proposal of the European Forum of Migrants, for a deontological code for the media, highlights in an amendment the essential role that the media should play in denouncing racism and promoting tolerance, showing particularly the positive contribution which immigrants have made and still make to European society."
"Let us live out in our daily lives the values of solidarity and brotherhood, adopting for ourselves the beautiful words of the writer Carlos Fuentes, which I quote: ' Our culture is not made from isolation but from communication, confrontation and contagion."
"A culture which wants to be pure and which closes its borders to other cultures is a culture destined to perish."
"You cannot find yourself, you cannot find your identity, except in contact with others."
"We are what we are by knowing what we are not' ."
"And I will ask the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to reflect on with a view to sanctioning the racist remarks of the groups on the extreme right who dare, within these walls, in complete incoherence, to promote racist ideas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, racism is first and foremost a state of mind, one which can become a way of life."
"It is an oversimplification to regard it as being the exclusive preserve of any particular political persuasion."
"Because even that statement implies a racist attitude."
"For example, a Member of this House, Mr Bossi, was condemned a few days ago by the Italian courts for having described the judge and former minister Di Pietro as a 'terrone' , a pejorative term for a southern Italian."
"Since Mr Bossi is a member of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, if we accept the reasoning of Section 4 of the report, the Liberal Group would be racist and, therefore, right-wing."
"These are the ludicrous conclusions resulting from the foolish syllogism to be found in Section 4 of the document."
"I have no doubt that Mr Bossi does take a racist attitude towards southern Italians, among others, but I would certainly not regard the entire Liberal Group as racist, in line with the 'Mickey Mouse' logic which says that if you are a racist, therefore you are right-wing, and simply because you are right-wing, therefore you are a racist."
"As a Catholic, and on behalf of the Italian Right, I say that it is no longer tolerable that we should settle for voting the umpteenth document to satisfy our consciences, and allow our governments to sign agreements with China, which is pursuing a policy of cultural genocide in Tibet and elsewhere; those same governments which were unable to take any action in the former Yugoslavia; which allow 500 thousand civilians in the Great Lakes region to wander helpless and unaided; which allow the outskirts of their big cities to be nothing less than ghettoes for immigrants and non-Community nationals."
"The problem exists, and it is undoubtedly a very serious one."
"All right, then, let's have a European Observatory, but, please, let's observe more accurately this time!"
"Mr President, I believe that the launch of the European Year against Racism should receive a very favourable reception today."
"It is one of the things the European Parliament has been proposing for many years - this is the first time that a specific campaign against racism has been undertaken by the European institutions in conjunction with the Member States. At last, the fundamental values of European democracy are being expressed in a practical way."
"In addition, this European year aims to encourage cooperation, partnership - as well as helping to make the problem more visible at European level - development and the exchange of experiences between all the partners operating at national and regional levels."
"And it is therefore an important contribution to the efforts being made by all those - and there are a great many of them - who have already become actively involved in this battle."
"Having said that, and having said that it is a great opportunity, we must also remember that it is an opportunity not to be wasted: let me say in the clearest possible terms that the campaign against racism is a matter for practice, not preaching."
"All too often we have preaching but no concrete action, no practice."
"As some Honourable Members have already noted, racism and xenophobia are the children of fear."
"Similarly the policies adopted by the Member States on immigration and asylum, dictated solely by considerations of public order, are children of fear: we know they are ineffective, we know that they are dangerous on the basis of democratic rights, but - as children of fear - they too create an alibi and legitimation for racism."
"And we know the populistic, demagogic use to which that fear is put by careless and unprincipled political schemers."
"I say to the Alleanza Nazionale member that I shall stop making attacks on the Right when the Right sees fit to abandon its demagogic, populistic exploitation of the problems of social division that come from immigration."
"This problem, though, is one that involves us all."
"Only other people are racist - but that isn't true."
"Primo Levi, a great Italian writer who was deported to Auschwitz as a Jew, noted in his books the existence in all of us of a 'grey zone' : a grey zone which tends to create a hostile attitude to anything different, and is too often tolerant of the inequalities that are becoming the central issue in today's democracies."
"If we want to deprive racism of the nourishment on which it feeds, it is hard to believe that we shall be able to achieve any results except through consistent action."
"The Year must take us forward in that direction."
"It is a challenge to us all: it is not enough to create a logo, however important that may be - what is needed is continuity of action."
"Mr President, as is the case every year, this debate on combating racism and xenophobia is a landmark in the European Parliament's activities."
"That is because it is not a routine and it is not just empty denunciation but it is against racism and xenophobia and because it proposes and advances with means of combating those phenomena."
"We congratulate Mr Ford and Mr Oostlander on their work which justifies what we have just said."
"Their reports propose the creation of legal instruments, namely an 'anti-discrimination' directive and follow up the decision by the Council to create a European Observatory for which there is already a draft regulation."
"It welcomes practical implementation of the proposal by the European Parliament to make this year 'European Year against Racism and Xenophobia' , and find ways of making sure that it is a coherent reality given the affirmations which the European Parliament has made."
"This is quite necessary."
"There are plenty of stances and affirmations by top officials which nourish a 'climate of suspicion' vis-√†-vis foreigners, especially those asking for asylum or for work."
"There is plenty of paternalism and humiliating tolerance but not enough real solidarity and respect for human rights in our procedures of legalising the presence of residents and workers, as has been noted in certain Member States of the European Union including my own."
"The proposal includes certain amendments tabled by our Group, which we note with satisfaction because they match our intention to help to improve a proposal which already deserved out support even before the amendments were tabled."
"Concerning one of these amendments, I should like to remind you of the title of a book by the Mozambican writer, Mia Couto, ' Each Man is a Race' ."
"Therefore, the fight against racism means that we should reject anything which is unfounded: concepts and terminology referring to race relations as a matter of constituted and hierarchical dialogue."
"I hope that this 'European Year against Racism' is going to be up to the standards demanded by the European Parliament and we should also remember that the budgetary amount, 4.7 million ECU is 20 % less that what we earmarked in May 1996, 6 million ECU, and we should try to make sure that budgetary restrictions do not turn the European Year against Racism into an empty date on the calendar."
"Mr President, if it is true that the British are vetoing the creation of a European Observatory against racism and xenophobia it is utterly incomprehensible and disgraceful."
"Perhaps Minister Dijkstal can say something on the subject presently."
"For years now the European Council, so John Major too, has been issuing solemn statements twice a year."
"On 6 December 1996 the General Affairs Council, including the United Kingdom, took a unanimous decision to set up this Observatory."
"And now it is supposedly giving it the thumbs down."
"I wonder whether Major, in the context of his general election campaign, is not perhaps appealing to the basest instincts of the British people."
"Or whether he is afraid to give European responsibility for combating racism to Brussels, so that British citizens too can take cases to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"I fervently hope that I am wrong and that it will be possible tomorrow, during the big anti-racism conference organized by the Dutch presidency, for Minister Dijkstal to announce formally the creation of the Observatory."
"The aim is to coordinate existing organizations and stop work being done twice over."
"What on earth is there to be afraid of in that?"
"I think this is yet one more example of what a hindrance the veto is."
"Fourteen countries want to move forward and one country is able to hold everything up."
"Lastly, in paragraph 29 of the resolution we make it plain that we want specific actions in favour of the people."
"I hope the presidency will support our proposal for a broad media campaign involving popular sporting heroes such as Ruud Gullit."
"Mr President, the Austrian Freedom Party members will fully support the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Oostlander."
"We particularly welcome the activities and events being arranged in connection with the European Year against Racism."
"It will be our task, as members of the European Parliament, to play an active part in such events in our own countries."
"In this introduction to this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament refers to another resolution of 9 May 1996, and expressly mentions the recommendations put forward there."
"That resolution contains a Recital H, whose content is a stain on the honour of the European Parliament."
"It sees fit to ostracize - I repeat, ostracize - in explicit terms a democratically elected party."
"That Austrian political party is the second largest Austrian group in this House and received 27 % of the votes cast in last year's European Parliament elections."
"It is represented on the governments of all nine Austrian Federal States."
"It is an insult to Austria when a million citizens who vote for the Freedom Party are dismissed as racists and ostracized in this European Parliament document."
"As is constantly demonstrated by our voting patterns and other activities in the European Parliament, we are convinced opponents of any form of racism, xenophobia or antisemitism, and strenuously condemn these deviant forms of human behaviour!"
"The Right-wing extremists are a handful of criminals, not organized into political parties."
"I feel members should be aware that we have today, in this House, received a blackmailing letter in which we are threatened with terrorist attacks and letter bombs."
"I ask you, Mr President, to take due note of this, and I trust that the rapporteurs on this subject will take due account of the truth and reality of the situation when the opportunity arises."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction at seeing the European Union concern itself with the great problems for civil peace and the future of the Union which racism and intolerance constitute."
"But I would also like, for my part, to mention those for whom racism is a business and who are constantly fanning embers which are still easily rekindled."
"By dint of making the foreigner, the immigrant, the other person, even if he is like oneself, and I am thinking here of anti-semitism, into the source of all current ills, their propaganda ends up contaminating souls thrown off course by the difficulties of the time."
"The scapegoat strategy, which worked so well in the 1930s, is back in business."
"French holders of this ideology usually say that they are fighting anti-French racism, which in their eyes is the most offensive and undoubtedly the most serious kind."
"That anti-national racism exists in the same way as anti-foreigner racism, I am all the more willing to admit since they fuel each other and since nobody can claim to be fighting one while fuelling the other."
"And the extreme right has been involved in fuelling racism for a very long time and in a very methodical way."
"When Mr Le Pen holds forth on the inequality of races, he is expressing a great ideological continuity."
"It was a very long time ago that one of his current fellow candidates was already theorising on this inequality of the races asserting that there should be slaves so that a new aristocracy might emerge, and that large collective enterprises for discipline and selection should be prepared."
"This colleague committed a second offence a short time later, without doubt so that there could be no ambiguity of interpretation, by speaking of training on the basis of race."
"So, dear colleagues, I would like you for a moment to imagine yourselves in the shoes of those who have good reason to believe that they would be cast, in this scenario, in the role of the new slaves rather than the new aristocrats."
"What would you feel in this situation?"
"Rebellion, violent aggression, and for some, a tendency to reject wholesale in the same way the author of these suggestions and all those like him."
"And that is how you fuel anti-French racism and anti-national racism simultaneously."
"That is how you set different kinds of people living on the same soil against each other."
"That is how you lead a country to the slippery slope of hatred and civil war."
"And, furthermore, the leader of the National Front has gone for advice to the best Serbian nationalist sources, paying a friendly visit as he just did to several virtuosos of ethnic cleansing who would be better placed in The Hague, before the international criminal court."
"So, Mr President, of course, let us combat racism with all our might, but lucidly, realistically, giving ourselves the means fully to do so and identifying those responsible."
"It is useless to try to put out the fire of racism with a glass of water while resigning ourselves to the fact that others are using flamethrowers to keep it alight."
"Mr President, racism is one of the most destructive phenomena in society."
"Racism, xenophobia and intolerance have increased to a worrying extent throughout Europe."
"Racism knows no borders."
"Consequently, every individual, especially we as politicians, and similarly every Member State, has a responsibility to act to eradicate racism."
"It is important that this year is being observed as the Year Against Racism, but that is not enough - where racism is concerned we need to be constantly vigilant, even when this year is over."
"When we speak of racism, we generally think of refugees and immigrants, who are often the targets of racism."
"However, I should also like to remind you that in every Member State of the EU there are other ethnic minorities who are daily subjected to discrimination and racism."
"In Europe as a whole there are some 7 or 8 million Roma, and even within the EU there are altogether some 1¬Ω to 2 million."
"In many countries the Roma are still without adequate rights and I should like to remind you here that at present the very existence of Roma or gypsies as a minority is not even recognized in all countries."
"I should hope, for example, that the European Union and Commissioner Flynn will take action on this matter and step up cooperation for example with the Council of Europe, thus enabling the European Union and the Council of Europe to combine their resources to this end."
"Mr President, today's debate on the European Year against Racism and Xenophobia shows that this phenomenon exists everywhere, as many Honourable Members have previously said."
"But even here, in Parliament, we quite often hear utterances that show little sign of tolerance, realism and frankness."
"Indeed, we have done so more than once in this past hour."
"Even here, honourable Members regularly make distinctions between Union citizens and those who live here but do not really belong, because they do not hold a passport issued by one of the Member States."
"So we must do everything we can to eliminate discrimination between Union citizens and those from other countries who in many cases have been living among us for a very long time - there are many in Germany who have been living there for more than 30 years - because this discrimination often results in a climate of xenophobia."
"If we are building a citizens' Europe, why cannot all citizens share in it?"
"Are there in fact first-class and secondclass citizens?"
"Why do we just talk about processes of integration when there is so much legislation standing in the way of those processes?"
"We even erect obstacles to prevent these citizens from becoming integrated."
"Just take a look at the laws on aliens in the various countries!"
"I myself know very well what I am talking about."
"As a Dutchwoman living in Germany, I know that I am treated differently from a German woman under the German Foreigners Act."
"As far as the possibilities of multiple citizenship are concerned, we talk about the subject all right, but what can we actually do to make it a reality?"
"There is one other point I would like to make: we have in the European Union four million dark-skinned Europeans who were born here and have Union passports but are constantly having to show those passports before anyone will believe that they really are Europeans."
"It is a disgrace that it should be impossible for all people to be treated equally!"
"Mr President, I hope that the European Year Against Racism will also be a year of tangible achievement, in particular at the Intergovernmental Conference, that the principle of non-discrimination as well as the principle of combatting racism, anti-semitism and xenophobia will be able to be written into the treaties."
"We need legal instruments to fight racism."
"For me, fighting racism also means creating a political Europe and democracy at European level."
"I am concerned to note that six countries, and in particular Belgium, have still not transposed into their own legislation the directive on the rights of European citizens in local and municipal elections."
"I am very concerned when it is indicated that the Belgian Minister of the Interior dismisses the possibility of agreement on the vote and the eligibility of European nationals in local elections."
"I am concerned, but I hope I am also mistaken."
"Belgium has already asked for and obtained dispensations."
"I hope that it will not challenge this right to vote, and beyond that, that we will be brave enough to widen this suffrage for European citizens to include citizens registered in our area for at least five years."
"The fight against racism also entails the integration of all into our political system, into democracy."
"And finally, I would like to ask our Austrian colleague if he takes us all for morons."
"Because, in short, it was not by calling upon reason, or upon explanation, that they had the success they have had in Austria, it was rather by an appeal to demagoguery and to the sentiment of rejection of others that it was achieved."
"I do not blame Austrian voters, I blame the political parties which, with great facility, sometimes say what the people want to hear and play on the sentiments of exclusion and racism."
"That is where their responsibility lies."
"Mr President, a great deal has been said in this debate in condemnation of racism and I want to agree with all of that."
"There is not a great deal more one can say."
"But I would like to quote an Asian religious leader who I heard speak some time ago."
"He visited the United States and they gave him a form which said 'state your race' , so he wrote 'human' ."
"They said 'you cannot put this' and he said 'why, are you disputing that I am human?' . I think that it is a nice reply."
"In addition to the vital need to combat all forms of racial discrimination, prejudice, hatred, violence and harassment, one also needs to accentuate the positive benefits of a multi-cultural, pluralistic society."
"Many of our countries have had influxes of people from outside over the centuries."
"We have benefitted and our societies have been enriched by their presence."
"Those societies that have tried to be exclusive and to keep out everybody else have tended to stagnate and atrophy."
"There are enormous benefits in a multi-cultural society and I am delighted to have the privilege to represent such an area here in the Parliament."
"Finally I would like to say I am dismayed at the attitude of the British Government in blocking the move towards the setting up of the anti-racist monitoring centre."
"They have done it for what are supposed to be technical reasons but they have shown no evidence of wanting to put those points right to give the Community competence to act, which it urgently needs."
"This is something the Inter-Governmental Conference must address and I hope it will."
"Mr President, I am neither a racist nor a xenophobe."
"My professional activity in medicine has been devoted in its entirety, throughout thirty years, to the saving of human lives, lives of men and women in all conditions, of all races, of all nationalities, without obtaining the slightest financial benefit from it, unlike some of my colleagues who have made their fortunes in caring for humans and of whom the representative given the most media coverage sits on our benches."
"The action I have carried out, and which I still take time to pursue today, for the benefit of the deprived, whatever their racial origin, gives me more right than any to declare that I am shocked by the resolution which is the subject of our discussion and which considers that defence of the choice of national preference should be condemned, according to the antiquated methods of the supreme Soviet, in the name of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Feret's speech brings us to the end of speaking time."
"The Council and the Commission have asked to speak through their representatives."
"But first Mr Fassa and Mr Konrad have asked to make personal statements under Rule 108."
"Mr Fassa, you have the floor first for a maximum of three minutes."
"Mr President, the statements made by the Honourable Member following whose speech I asked to make a personal statement are the clearest possible illustration of how it is possible to it possible to speak in favour of tolerance and anti-racism using arguments that are in themselves a model of intolerance."
"I do not believe that cheap speeches can exploit questions of the utmost importance simply in order to make demagogic capital out of problems like anti-racism and xenophobia, for the purposes of a purely Italian political struggle."
"This is not, in my view, the right way to honour either this Parliament or the thousands of people who have given their lives for ideals which - like the anti-fascist struggle against racism and xenophobia - are fully consistent with that liberal, democratic, reformist and European tradition which I, as a Member of the European and Italian Parliaments elected on the Lega lists, have the honour to support."
"Mr President, I note that Mr Fassa has not expressed any disagreement with the words spoken by Mr Bossi."
"I have no desire to engage here in vulgar arguments about matters that concern the Italian Parliament and the Italian political parties."
"But I would like to add - since words should lead to concrete facts and actions - that it has been requested that Mr Bossi should be committed for trial because, in the course of a political meeting, he told his audience that a 'cleansing' operation should have been carried out against all the Alleanza Nazionale supporters in Northern Italy."
"I believe that such attitudes, apart from their folklore elements, are deserving of censure."
"That was why I listened, respectfully I assure you, to what Mr Fassa said, and I am convinced that, in his heart of hearts, he certainly would not endorse these racist statements made by his party leader."
"Dr Konrad, you will be able to speak at the end of the debate, after the representatives of the Council and the Commission. That is what the Rules of Procedure say."
"Mr President, I have listened with very great interest to what the various speakers have said."
"Many aspects of this complex issue have been touched on."
"I cannot go into every one of those aspects, partly because of time constraints, so I shall pick out briefly those which I myself consider to be the main points."
"Perhaps in the first place I should address the comments made by, I think, Mrs d'Ancona, Mrs Ojala, Mrs Roth, Mrs Heinisch and Mr Cars, concerning what we might call our policy on integration."
"You can fight racism, antisemitism and discrimination through the law, the police and the judiciary, but you can also try to fight it using the substance of your policy, and a policy of integration is perhaps the most effective way of tackling this kind of phenomenon."
"I readily endorse everything which has been said on this matter."
"Particularly, perhaps, when it is aimed at young people and education, and here I am looking back not only to what Mrs d'Ancona and Mr Cars said but also to what Mr Watson said."
"There is much more to be done here than we have done so far in terms of reminding people of how, regrettably, all this first began."
"Mrs d'Ancona's reference to Auschwitz is, I think, very apposite, but it is equally important to point to the potential of younger people to shape their own lives and the society in which they live."
"Concerning the Observatory, I must say that there is solid support for this in Parliament too."
"But that there are some worries that our efforts to agree the right legal form will hold things up."
"I think we really must try to prevent that."
"I shall welcome the chance to liaise on this with Mr Flynn to see how we can bring this to a conclusion as efficiently and as speedily as possible."
"For the moment I will repeat what I said earlier, namely that I think the United Kingdom too will undoubtedly be convinced of the need for this Observatory and will cooperate to find a satisfactory solution."
"Perhaps the most important point made here is that made by a number of people, and I will specifically name them: apart form Mrs d'Ancona there was Mr Schulz, Mrs Pailler, Mr Bontempi, Mrs Lindeperg and Mrs Zimmermann."
"People who really want to fight racism will make that plain at all times, must make it plain in what they say and how they behave."
"All those who fail to do this bear a very, very heavy responsibility."
"It is something which all of us should do as politicians, you as elected parliamentarians and we as what one might term the executive, but all of us should do it as individual citizens of the European Union."
"Only if we set an example can we really insist that other citizens in Europe do likewise."
"As the saying goes, it is a case of putting our own house in order first."
"That is what is needed in this important area of measures against racism and discrimination."
"I will leave it at that and in the course of our presidency I shall try to keep Parliament informed of what we are doing and what our further plans are."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all those who contributed."
"We have heard exceptional and worthwhile contributions to this debate."
"I would like to make reference to two particular points."
"Mrs Heinisch raised the point of what we were going to do by way of support for those who wished to get involved in projects."
"The simple answer here is we have ECU 4.7m, modest I agree but it is, of course, additional money."
"Application forms for projects will go out within the next week to all those who have contacted the Commission services."
"Everyone will be able to apply at the same time and we look forward to a very fair and transparent decision as to who and what money will be provided."
"I would also like to make special reference to what Mrs Roth said."
"The points made by Mrs Roth captured in essence very many of the excellent responses and submissions that were made to this debate."
"Mrs Roth made the point to us all: do something."
"I would suggest to the House that is precisely what this Year Against Racism is aiming to do."
"Mrs Roth said we need anti-discrimination policies."
"Yes, we do, and we need them at both levels; at national level, in so far as legislation is concerned, and we need a clause enshrined in the Treaty; an antidiscrimination clause that would give us the opportunity to use the necessary Community instruments to deal with the threat posed by racism."
"You also made the point that we need proper integration policies."
"Having considered very carefully all the issues, we have decided on the workshops that will take place over the next few days in The Hague at the launch of our seminar and conference."
"The workshops will include: workshops to examine the relationship between race and employment and a workshop on the legal framework to combat racism."
"We will also talk about the role of the media."
"Lastly, we will discuss everyday racism which was uppermost in your mind."
"The main instrument of protection that those threatened by racism have is, of course, the law."
"That is primarily the responsibility of the individual Member States."
"But that is not to say that the Community cannot have action at European level."
"Throughout the European Year Against Racism, we are going to fund projects that tackle legislative issues."
"In particular there will be projects which raise awareness of existing laws against discrimination and encourage people to make full use of the existing laws and to pinpoint the lacunae in the existing national legislation and try to do something about them."
"The point was made that a lot of talk goes on about this subject and I agree with that."
"I would suggest to the Parliament there is a need to make a lot of speeches against racism."
"Speeches should be made in every single Member State so that people can recognize that we stand against racism and we recognize the threat that it poses to society."
"We should especially encourage our non-Governmental organisations because therein lie the activists, the people who are committed to doing something to protect the fundamentals on which this Union was founded, namely peace and harmony."
"They should get a signal from this Parliament and from the Year Against Racism as to what we stand for, what Europe stands for as far as the threat of racism is concerned."
"I understand that to be peace and harmony, dignity, mutual respect and fair play not determined by race, creed, colour or origin."
"These are the fundamental objectives of this Union and we should make the speeches, both here and outside, to say that clearly to the people of Europe."
"I will allow Dr Konrad to make a personal statement, and I would like to point out to him that Rule 108 states that a Member who asks to make a personal statement shall be heard at the end of the discussion of the item being dealt with or when the minutes of the sitting to which the request for leave to speak refers are considered for approval."
"Therefore, Dr Konrad, I am not late in giving you leave to speak."
"This is the end of the discussion, now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my statement refers to remarks made by Mr Schulz and Mr Le Gallou in the course of this debate."
"Both of them, by quoting comments by others and making comments of their own, bitterly attacked both the German Federal Chancellor and the German Finance Minister with untenable and insulting allegations."
"I reject these remarks on behalf of the CDU/CSU Group, and I should also point out that I do so on my own behalf, too, since I as a German Member of Parliament am personally affected."
"Germany makes a very great contribution to European integration."
"Germany is currently sheltering 400, 000 war refugees."
"For many years, our country has done much to integrate people from Eastern Europe."
"There are 2 million Turks living in Germany - another contribution to integration!"
"So my country and my fellow citizens are making a very great contribution to that integration which has been the specific subject of this debate."
"I should like to make it very clear at this point that Germany, as one of Europe's most hospitable countries, has done nothing to deserve this kind of onslaught, especially as it comes both from the far Left and from the far Right."
"I must call upon both gentlemen concerned to apologize for their remarks before the end of this debate."
"Dr Konrad, while you were speaking I asked myself whether it really was a personal statement that you were making."
"It was a political statement, in fact, not a personal one."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Honourable Member, following whose remarks I spoke a little earlier, for having given me credit - quite correctly - for in no way endorsing outrageous or insulting statements, no matter by whom they are made."
"All of us in the Liberal Group are in agreement with that."
"I would however remind him that, under every democratic constitution, criminal liability is personal: no one can be called to account for facts or actions attributed to others."
"It will be objected, however, that this is a political problem: well, I believe that one of the worst defects of political life today, not just in Italy, is the use of legal procedures for political ends."
"This, too, is in danger of becoming a manifestation of intolerance, but it must be kept absolutely outside of the debates in this Parliament."
"Mr President, I must comment on what Mr Konrad has just said."
"I don't know whether you were here in the Chamber during the debate, Mr Konrad."
"If you were, then there are only two possibilities: either you misunderstood me or you weren't listening."
"Because what I did was in fact the exact opposite of what I have been accused of."
"I specifically defended the German politicians quoted by Mr Le Gallou against that attack, by saying - stop shouting and listen - that to compare the Federal Chancellor and the Finance Minister with the members of the Front National would be an insult to them."
"That is point one."
"And, point two, I said that all of us - political leaders and political activists - must have a care to express ourselves so that no misunderstandings are possible."
"That is not a criticism of the Federal Chancellor, nor is it a criticism of any CDU politician."
"There would be sufficient reasons to criticize him, incidentally, but you misunderstood."
"Now just think about whether you can undo what you have just done, by putting me on the same footing as them."
"That is an insult!"
"Mr Schulz, I note that it is not just with the interpretation - which is usually quite all right - that we can have problems. We sometimes have them with our own language as well."
"Mr President, I do not use language like that, I speak French."
"But I would like to reassure Mr Konrad and the whole Assembly."
"I did not attack the German minister, nor the German Chancellor, I pointed out that they had made remarks about the cost of immigration, about the link between immigration and unemployment."
"Another of our colleagues, when talking about immigration, or the excessive number of refugees, used the word 'burden' , and I think that Mr Konrad used it again."
"I am simply pointing out that these remarks can be made in public debate in the Federal Republic of Germany, and I am delighted, because they must have freedom of opinion, freedom of expression there."
"Our German colleagues can think that and other German colleagues can think differently, and I think that is freedom of discussion and I am delighted with it."
"It is only that I deplore the fact that, here, when we make similar remarks on national preference or on the cost of immigration, we are rebuked for it, and that within the borders of France, a certain number of local French members are taken to court for making remarks comparable to those of Mr Waigel or Mr Kohl. I do not condemn the remarks of Mr Waigel or Mr Kohl, I condemn the fact that they cannot be made as freely in France."
"It is freedom of expression that I am defending."
"My dear colleagues, we cannot continue this discussion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Combating terrorism"
"The next item is the report (A4-0368/96) by Mrs Reding, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on combating terrorism in the European Union."
"Mr President, allow me to express our disappointment."
"We have had enough, because every time an act of terrorism is carried out, our governments stick together, make strong statements and promise action at European level, as well as effective political measures."
"Several weeks, several months later, what is the result: nothing, zero."
"The wonderful words have been forgotten, the political projects lie dormant in drawers."
"Parliament has had enough of beautiful rhetoric."
"It would like to see materialise at last all this activity which is essential for combatting, beyond national frontiers, the scourge of organised crime and terrorism."
"To do this, it is essential that the elements of national sovereignty are shared."
"This shared sovereignty will not be a minus for national interests, but on the contrary, it will safeguard national interests."
"Because, do not let us deceive ourselves, the European market for organised crime does exist, but the activity of those who should be fighting these criminals is blocked by artificial barriers at national frontiers."
"This is inefficient and it is ridiculous."
"It is high time our governments understood that if they do not create a true European legal area, if they do not allow their police to collaborate actively and effectively across national borders, they are in danger of losing the sovereignty which is so dear to them, because it will not be them, the politicians, who are making the law, but all kinds of criminals."
"What is true for crime in general is all the more true for the extreme and specific type which is terrorism."
"Firstly, how do we define terrorism?"
"We deem terrorist all acts committed by individuals or groups which resort to violence or which threaten violence against a nation, its institutions, its population and which are motivated by separatist objectives, extreme ideological conceptions or religious fanaticism, or even by irrational and incomprehensible motives and which aim to subject the authorities of individuals or groups to a climate of terror."
"That is the definition."
"Now for our interpretation."
"Since Europe is founded upon legal States which allow every citizen, or group of citizens, to use its democratic structures to be heard and to put its ideas into practice, no ideology, nor any motive, can provide the slightest justification for terrorist actions."
"It is clear from our point of view, therefore, that terrorism is a criminal act which should be treated as such."
"So there should be no exceptional laws or procedures for combatting terrorism, so that we do not grant it a particular importance which by this very fact would involuntarily increase its value."
"How do we combat terrorism physically on the ground?"
"Firstly, there is the preventive aspect."
"Political prevention, to begin with."
"The promotion of democratic dialogue to contribute to the resolution by political means of political, ethnic, national, social and ecological conflicts, and to prevent these conflicts becoming an alibi for terrorism and obtaining a certain condonation within sections of the population."
"And then, technical prevention: airport controls, improvement of systems for the detection of explosives, implementation of efficient and coordinated computerised systems, prevention of the abuse of data communication networks, control of the manufacture, storage, trade, transportation, importation and exportation of arms and explosive substances."
"Regarding cooperation of police and legal systems, we would like to see Europol up and running at last, because, there too, after each session of the Council, we hear fine words, saying: we need Europol."
"And in practice, the convention is not even ratified."
"When will it be ratified?"
"We cannot commence any serious work until such time as we have a convention."
"We would also like Member States to classify acts of terrorism in their respective criminal laws as serious, extraditable crimes; where an act of terrorism is committed, to prosecute everyone involved in its organisation, preparation or commission; and to define an apologia for terrorism, under their legislation, as a criminal offence."
"We would also like to step up police cooperation in combatting terrorism, to enable the exchange of information even if there is no specific link with criminal proceedings, to promote direct exchanges of opinions and experiences between the officers of the different Member States responsible for combatting terrorism, to see the Convention on extradition, signed on 27 September 1996, ratified and to see the necessary decisions made and measures taken so that nationals of one Member State accused of terrorist crimes or collaboration with armed groups cannot obtain political asylum or refugee status in another Member State."
"Of course, we wish to harmonise legislation on the matter, but until this is done, we would ask that Member States make specific decisions and apply them by means of conventions."
"And we would also like victims of terrorism to be looked after, along with their families, materially and psychologically, not only at the time of the act of terrorism, but during the years through which the ill done them endures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is standard practice in this House to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports."
"Sometimes it's just a polite formula, but in congratulating Mrs Reding today I mean every word I say."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mrs Reding, may I say that over this whole period - the writing of the report, the debate, the negotiations on the amendments, right through to today - it has been a pleasure to work with you on an extremely sensitive question."
"You, as rapporteur, showed a degree of cooperativeness on that question that could serve as a model for other debates in this House."
"And so, as I say, we offer not only our congratulations but our most sincere thanks."
"In the report, you made very significant progress towards a precise definition, or an attempt at a precise definition, of what terrorism is - something very difficult to achieve, because the terrorism debate in the Member States of the European Union is still an extremely difficult one, one that tugs at the emotions, as was evident in our discussions right up to the very last day - I shall come to an example shortly."
"There are three things we must do, a point which Mrs Reding made very clearly."
"First, an unambiguous statement: there can be no acceptance in a democratic, rule-of-law State for any kind of terrorist activity, whether it be violence against property or violence against individuals."
"Nothing, in a democratic legal system, can legitimize terror and violence."
"That must be made clear to the terrorists, across every shade of political opinion - they cannot expect acceptance and assistance anywhere, however ostensibly political their motives may be!"
"As a consequence of this, we need a definition: what is terrorism?"
"Is it just directed against property, or against individuals and property, or against institutions, or with a view to destabilizing the body politic?"
"Does terrorism acquire any kind of legitimacy if preceded by a long period of injustice - whether ethnic or economic or otherwise motivated?"
"We were actually unanimous in reaching a clear decision here."
"We must commit ourselves, in the political acts of governments and States and their institutions, to ensuring that the danger areas in which terrorism can germinate are identified at an early stage - that prompt action is taken and prompt efforts are made to eliminate focal points of resentment, even justified resentment, by bringing the problems out into the open for democratic debate, by attempting to bring about reconciliation, and by never giving up hope of resolving conflicts by peaceful means."
"If we can do that, we ourselves will acquire the legitimate right consistently to reject any other way of resolving conflicts and so, logically, we shall also acquire the right to say, in the terrorism debate: any person who resorts to individual terror or group terror, or resorts to terror tactics against individual people or individual groups, cannot hope to find any sympathy within the democratic legal structure, whether in the Member States of our Union that are governed by the rule of law, or in the Union itself."
"Above all, he must expect to be the subject of criminal proceedings, pursued with the utmost rigour, as a perpetrator of criminal acts - and, I repeat, with no consideration whatever being given to any alleged political motive."
"The reason why it is so important to say this is because terrorist organizations in the European Union have, in the past, repeatedly been able to create a spurious political legitimacy for their actions."
"Our group hopes that this report will enable us to reject that legitimacy unambiguously and to make a contribution to an expert, efficient joint campaign against the cancer of terrorism!"
"A blue bond, Mr President. The sky over the European Union today is an immense blue bond stretching from Las Palmas to Malmo, from Rhodes to Dublin."
"A blue bond which is the silent witness of a daily struggle, of social rejection of terrorism in the Basque Country of Spain, an area particularly scarred by this social ulcer."
"Echoing the rapporteur, the citizens of Europe, represented in this chamber, raise their voices loud and clear today. They have had enough, they are all united against terrorism, and they are drawing a line in the sand: democrats on this side, terrorists, who are common criminals, on the other."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an important vote."
"I have no doubt that the resolution before us will receive the support of the house by an overwhelming majority, and I now have the honour to announce, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, our group's commitment to the resolution as well as to the various amendments, especially Nos 2, 4, 5, 6 and 11."
"And echoing Mr Schulz, I also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Reding, on her laudable work."
"Mr President, this is an important and symbolic vote."
"All Europe is united in the determination to repel terrorist acts and committed to this fight against terrorism - and not just against terrorism in itself, but against all the paraphernalia that surrounds it, its frontmen, activists and sympathizers."
"As Mrs Reding said, and it is important, the European Union is founded on the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms. So there can certainly be no protection for terrorism and terrorist acts, and not even the barest understanding of them."
"Any ideological or political position must be channelled within the bounds of the law, and those who place themselves outside that channel should be called what they are: dangerous common criminals, to be dealt with by the law."
"And again I associate myself with the full force and rigour of Mrs Reding's comments."
"This resolution also moves from the general to the particular and calls for measures the citizens of Europe are demanding here and now to fight this social ulcer."
"Mrs Reding has enumerated them. I shall just take up the most symbolic and outstanding of them."
"European citizens are calling on the governments to cooperate more."
"They are calling for Europe to have powers against terrorism at an early date, for an apologia for terrorism to be prosecuted throughout the European Union as a criminal offence, and for no Member State to grant asylum or refugee status to any EU citizen who has committed or is accused of terrorist acts in the European Union."
"And, of course, unconditional support for victims of terrorism."
"This resolution brings hope and encouragement."
"Hope because, in a troubled world, the European Union is once again raising the banner of justice and human rights."
"Today, this banner is the blue flag which brings all the citizens of Europe together, torn by terrorism but with their gaze fixed on a future of social peace. It is a tribute from us all to the victims of terrorism, past and present, to those two Spanish citizens - Jos√© Antonio Ortega Lara and Cosme Delclaux - who currently encapsulate all the horror and grief of terrorism, and to their families and relatives."
"And Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today this banner of fundamental rights, this European flag, is a blue standard symbolizing the bond which extends across the European Union, from Las Palmas to Malmo and from Rhodes to Dublin."
"Mr President, congratulations on your re-election, it is nice to see you back in the Chair."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her in-depth report on combatting terrorism in the European Union."
"This issue was raised at the recent Dublin summit where the European Council condemned unreservedly all terrorist attacks and stated its intention to pay closer attention to the threat posed by terrorism, both internally and externally; a clear statement which I fully endorse and welcome."
"As the rapporteur says, acts of terrorism violate numerous fundamental rights of the individual, particularly the right to life, the right to physical integrity and the right to personal freedom."
"Acts of terrorism have tragically ended the lives of innocent people; men, women and children."
"Those who have suffered injury by being in the wrong place at the wrong time bear permanent scars and are witness to be evil consequences of those who seek to achieve their aims by terrorist rather than democratic means."
"No one can be above the democratic process."
"Democracy and the law of fundamental freedoms in our society must be upheld at every level and this includes the forces of law and order of the state."
"In this regard, I seek here your support for our Amendment No 7 which calls on governments and the forces of law and order to show a common understanding and respect for human rights and to remain within the rule of law in the common fight against terrorism."
"It will come as no surprise to Members if I take this opportunity, provided by today's debate, to raise the question of the situation of certain Irish prisoners in two British jails."
"Last Monday with my colleagues, Mr Gallagher and Mr Crowley we visited Rois√≠n McAliskey who is a remand prisoner in Holloway womens' prison in London facing charges not in Britain but in Germany."
"She is wanted for extradition in connection with a terrorist incident and has been convicted of nothing."
"Rois√≠n, in my view, should not be subject to this kind of treatment."
"She has been convicted of nothing and nonetheless is in the highest category of security prison."
"She is six months pregnant."
"Her condition is extremely frail and she does not have full-time access to medical attention and treatment."
"She is subject to strip-searching twice a day and sometimes, in certain circumstances, as often as six times a day."
"She is locked in a cell, where she is under constant watch by television camera monitoring and special guards."
"She has no contact in the prison with other inmates."
"I have to say in fairness that the Governor of Holloway prison listened carefully to the case we made and said he would try to improve her situation within the prison regime in so far as his remit was concerned."
"All we are seeking is for dignity in her treatment and a transfer back to Northern Ireland while she awaits extradition proceedings."
"It seems to me that her treatment is not dissimilar to the treatment of prisoners in Whitemoor where I believe a major cover-up and collusion between the judiciary and politicians has taken place."
"Mr President, it is indeed most important that we as the European Parliament, as members elected directly by the voters, should be discussing terrorism here."
"It is intolerable that innocent people are the victims of violence, even politically motivated violence."
"That is not on and we cannot have it."
"Terrorism is a difficult concept, though. because there is also such a thing as the fight for freedom."
"Take the freedom fighter Mandela, now President of South Africa."
"But clearly there can be no misunderstanding: in a democracy which has universal suffrage there is never any place for terrorism, the use of violence."
"It is a serious crime."
"We of the Liberal Group also like this report of Mrs Reding's."
"We are happy to agree with most of it."
"I think we have to be clear and establish the rule that terrorists who are nationals of a Member State of the European Union are not entitled to claim asylum."
"I am thinking of Spain, of Ireland; we cannot allow it."
"We have to be very clear on that."
"Such things are not admissible."
"And there is more."
"We must be tough on third countries, the rest of the world outside the European Union, which backs terrorist movements."
"Lastly, I would make the point that we should be careful in our dealings with the media."
"The right to freedom of expression in this context must be upheld."
"Mr President, we congratulate Mrs Reding on her report, which represents an important instrument against terrorism and raises the need to build a genuine European legal area where the legal decisions of Member States are recognized and standardized."
"Terrorist acts inside the European Union cannot be justified in any way because they appeal to ideologies or religious, cultural or national identities."
"Regardless of any political motivation, they must be treated as criminal acts and subject to criminal prosecution."
"Terrorist acts violate many fundamental rights, in particular the right to life, physical integrity and individual freedom, and in many cases they destabilize peace and economic and social development in local and regional communities, and undermine their democratic institutions."
"Some Member States of the Union - and this has to be said very clearly - are having to cope with cross-border terrorist action."
"Because of this, we need a consistent, Europe-wide group of measures on the prevention and prosecution of terrorism."
"So our group firmly supports the amendment calling on the Council to adopt the necessary measures to prevent any national of a Member State accused of terrorism or collaboration with an armed group obtaining refugee status in another Member State."
"Asylum policy can only apply to nationals of third countries who do not live in a democracy."
"Because we are democrats and live in democracy, our anti-terrorist measures must always be shown to comply with the rule of law. Even terrorists are entitled to due process and protection, and their human rights must be respected at all times."
"That is the great strength of democracy and the rule of law that we are upholding here today."
"And when we call for ratification of the Europol Convention, we are saying there must be no discrimination against any group and there must be clear definition of the information Europol will use and the way it will handle files."
"Mr President, if we consider the rights of those accused of terrorism, how much more do we remember and share the suffering and anguish of victims of terrorism, their families and friends, and their communities! In my country, Spain, those victims of terrorism may be decent members of the national or regional armed forces or security forces, representatives of democratic institutions, or citizens indiscriminately murdered en masse in public places."
"The men, women and children who die like that only make the news once they are dead."
"We remember with sadness the 1, 000 or so fatal victims of terrorism in Spain, including Enrique Casas, Gregorio Ord√≥√±ez, Fernando M√∫gica and Francismo Tom√°s y Valiente, who were active in the democratic institutions, and the Captain General of Madrid, Quintana Lacaci, who defended Spanish democracy so firmly against the attempted coup d'√©tat of 1981."
"We also remember the many people who have been mutilated, like Irene Villa, and especially those currently held captive and subjected to cruel physical torture, Jos√© Antonio Ortega Lara and Cosme Delclaux."
"I will end there, Mr President, but in remembering them, I want to call for real, and effective moral and material aid under the law, for them and their families, and we also call on Parliament and the European institutions to make a greater and better joint effort to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that the admirable work done by Mrs Reding is a source of controversy, but that is because of the controversial nature of its subject: terrorism."
"Next, I have two positive comments to make on the report: first, the opening of borders does not increase the danger of terrorist activities, because - as Mrs Reding rightly says - the traditional border controls virtually never result in the arrest of a terrorist; secondly, Mrs Reding pertinently remarks that a great many terrorist acts are organized and financed by certain States."
"However, I should also like to raise a point which confuses me."
"I resolutely, absolutely resolutely, condemn any form of violence."
"Having said that, I cannot understand why, in Recital A and Recital H, we are told that in the Member States of the Union we cannot talk about terrorism but only about crime, and that therefore - the conclusion is - political asylum must be confined solely to citizens of third countries."
"I believe there is a leap of logic here."
"It is self-referential and excessively ideological, in the proposed revision of the treaty, to rule out - not just in practice and for the present but actually in theory and for the future - the possibility that there could ever be a case where political asylum is justified for political citizens of Member States."
"In this context, I quote and endorse the concern expressed by the Italian section of Amnesty International - the concern that Europe, the home of democracy, may become a neutral zone for the purposes of the fundamental right of asylum, whatever the State to which the asylum seeker belongs."
"That is unacceptable, at least while Europe remains, as it is at present, a diversity of States, of legal systems and of police forces."
"Mr President, firstly, our thanks to Mrs Reding for the intelligent and realistic things she has put in her text."
"It is regrettable, however, that it is a report of initiative which has no binding power, but we must be glad for what we have."
"I personally experienced a childhood in which those who struggled against Nazi oppression were shot, or deported as terrorists."
"Thank heavens and the action of our parents that, today, within the European Union, we have a constitutional state and the democratic rule of law governing our institutions."
"The political violence which attempts to overthrow these institutions actually finds no justification and it must be fought on all sides without weakness."
"There are several very positive, very courageous and very truthful aspects of this text which deserve to be highlighted, and the first is the fact that the measures implemented for combatting terrorism must in no way be founded upon laws of exception."
"I think that this is a case of extreme political courage, to which I subscribe entirely."
"The second element is the fact that the opening of borders has in no way increased the risk of acts of terrorism."
"In this respect, and here slightly I am referring back to the fringes of the previous debate, we must be a bit careful that the image of terrorism, as carried by the media, does not strengthen the case of the most mentally deficient, some of whom are even seated within this house."
"Terrorism in Europe is not a foreign secretion."
"It is not an imported commodity, as people would have us believe."
"It does not come to us only from Iran, Libya, Algeria, Afghanistan or elsewhere, it is born and it grows comfortably on our own soil, nurtured by the scorn of democratic institutions, by intolerance and by the waywardness of certain nationalistic claims."
"Let there be no mistake about it."
"This waywardness is in no way obligatory."
"And our Scottish and some of our Catalan colleagues, right here, can demonstrate that it is possible to nurture nationalist aspirations and promote a scrupulous respect for the institution of democracy."
"On this point they are, I think, an exemplary defence."
"The third item which it seems to me important to highlight is the fact of qualifying, or having qualified as a criminal offence the apologia of terrorism."
"This is a necessary step in the breaking up not only of terrorism, but of the political demagoguery which often surrounds it."
"Finally, an appeal should be made to the courage of citizens to combat terrorism and to participate actively in the reinsertion into society and a professional and political life of those who, at one time, might have succumbed to the temptation of terrorism."
"Mr President, first of all I welcome the report and would like to congratulate the rapporteur; she quite clearly has put a lot of time and effort into its preparation."
"Terrorism is one of the scourges of our modern society."
"It operates in different areas, it uses different means and tactics depending on where it happens to raise its ugly head."
"There are always a small number of people - and we have to recognise that this normally is a very small number of people - holding the vast majority to ransom at the barrel of a gun or the threat of the bomb."
"In Northern Ireland where I come from we have suffered sustained terrorism."
"It has strained the people of the province and has created a very deep division in the population which continues to this day."
"Terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed."
"We have to recognise that we must be prepared to protect the general population and the rule of law must always prevail."
"On extradition, the European Union has shown to have a very serious weakness."
"It has not covered itself with great glory because some countries have not been prepared to face up to their responsibilities."
"There have been many experiences of Member States ducking out of those responsibilities and not doing what they should do."
"This is only encouragement to the terrorist."
"The terrorist feeds on this type of propaganda; this is what he needs to survive, it is grist to his mill."
"No one has the right to take another life, no one at all and I will never defend anyone for doing so."
"Common criminals should be treated as common criminals and it should not be forgotten that a lot of the people under the guise of terrorism are actively involved in the trafficking of drugs, protection rackets and are making vast amounts of money under the name of particular letters of the alphabet."
"I have had personal experience in Northern Ireland of terrorism; it is something I would never wish on any part of the human race."
"I look forward to the time when there will be no terrorism and we will not in any way featherbed them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the end of the Cold War we have seen a resurgence of terrorism, associated in particular with the intensification of regional, religious and ethnic conflict."
"Many of these phenomena already existed before the Cold War, even though, particularly in the eastern countries, they were formerly hidden beneath the ruins of the Communist system."
"This terrorism is ideological in form, created to attack dissidents. It can be subdivided, as I see it, into religious terrorism and fanatical terrorism and thrives on the differences between national legislations, prospering in those countries which best guarantee freedom of movement and assembly."
"The European area represents the ideal soil for this, the appropriate fuel for the flame."
"To combat terrorism, of whatever kind, effectively we must - and here I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Reding - smash the vicious circle that has been created by preventing the proliferation of those subcultures that feed it; we must depoliticize - if you will excuse the word - the terrorist act, reducing it to the mere status of a common crime; we must use technical resources for combating terrorism, such as infiltration and disinformation, ensuring that the struggle is equipped with appropriate human and technical resources; we must apply simplified extradition procedures and train up a class of judges and police officers as experts in the legal systems of the various Member States; we must communitize the powers of the European Union to deal with terrorism, because an open Community must ensure that it has common legislation to combat this extremely serious problem; we must improve international investigative cooperation, which must also include improving cooperation between judicial authorities; and, finally, we must harmonize the European Union's criminal laws."
"This is the only way in which we can try to defeat the terrorist phenomenon: it is one of the great challenges of our times."
"Mr President, just a few days ago books were burned in my country."
"There was an attack on the window of a bookshop which suffered similar acts during the black years of the dictatorship."
"Books were burned in the Basque Country by terrorist sympathizers who justify violence on grounds of 'identity' and/or ideology."
"In the name of these things, they assassinate, kidnap, torture, and end people's lives indiscriminately - as Mr Alonso Puerta mentioned - people like Enrique Casas, a politician, Tom√°s y Valiente and so many other members of the security forces, and ordinary citizens whose lives have been destroyed just by chance."
"The effect this has on the people affected is not easy to convey to others."
"Even talking to my comrades in my own political group, I sometimes find it hard not to stray into the realms of demagoguery, but I have to recognize and I do recognize that it is difficult to understand what has not been experienced."
"I am Catalan, as Bernard Pradier said, and I live in a land which struggled for its own identity for years and years, but I have to say I never understood violence in politics and, of course, we have never practised it."
"My own emotional attitude was radically changed by a terrorist act in a workers' quarter of my town, when I saw the corpses of people who had been out shopping quietly on a Friday evening being carried out of a hypermarket, and when I saw the silent grief of the community."
"Mr President, the European Union was created so that no more books would be burned, no more dead would lie beneath any flag, no more violence would be justified by any cause, and conflicts would be solved peacefully and through dialogue. In our democracies that is perfectly possible."
"With this report, the European Parliament is getting closer to the citizens who trust the European Union to give us greater freedom, ensure that we live in peace, and defend us."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on that. I congratulate her because I really do think the work she has done is excellent, I hope this house will pass her report by a large majority, and I urge it to do so."
"Our citizens would not understand why there could not be more active cooperation in a Union policy constructed by democratic countries or why every possible effort might not be made to fight terrorism actively and firmly."
"I believe Parliament will take another step in that direction tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first words must be of congratulation to Mrs Reding for her excellent report."
"We hoped against hope that this report would not have to be written but unfortunately there are still people in the European Union today who do not respect coexistence, human rights and democratic principles."
"Previous speakers have already covered many of the points in the report, like terrorism, prevention, police and court cooperation, criminal prosecution, the need for swift ratification of the Europol Convention and, above all, regarding any terrorist act as a criminal act to be prosecuted under the criminal law."
"But let me highlight two points in this report which I consider fundamental."
"The first is classification of an apologia for terrorism as a criminal offence in the legislation of Member States as a crime and the second is effective aid to victims of terrorism."
"On the first, we cannot, as democrats, allow articles and statements justifying, defending or praising terrorist acts to be disseminated with impunity."
"Any act or demonstration of that kind increases confusion and uncertainty in the fight against terrorism, and any encouragement of the phenomenon should not only be banned, but should also be prosecuted under the criminal law."
"There can be no justification for violence and any such argument loses its force when reason acknowledges death and suffering."
"It is precisely the victims of terrorism and their relatives who suffer and that is why I want to highlight the crucial need to establish a European Union solidarity fund for victims of terrorism."
"In a Europe where we talk about European citizenship, democracy, freedom and solidarity, we must show solidarity with citizens affected by a social ulcer like terrorism, with victims of terror, intolerance and oppression."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to fight terrorism properly, it is essential that Member States bring criminal prosecutions not only against the actual perpetrators of terrorist acts, but also against any person, group or structure which has participated in their organization, preparation or execution."
"Without adequate infrastructure, many terrorist acts might not come about and, that is why we need to extend criminal responsibility to those who collaborate with terror."
"As long as democrats are united against terrorism, as repeatedly demonstrated in this Parliament, freedom, peaceful coexistence and democracy will overcome."
"Because it represents the will of all the citizens of the European Union, this Parliament's stand against terrorism is of vital importance amongst the many others."
"Mr President, my final words must be to remember the people still held captive by the oppressors of freedom and call for their release."
"Mr. President, terrorism cannot be tolerated in a society governed by the rule of law."
"It must be fought at every level, using legitimate means."
"The creation of a democratic society, open towards its people and the world about it, is the best way of destroying the breeding grounds of terrorism."
"Measures which prevent the escalation of ethnic, national, social and economic conflicts are also important."
"Practical and technical improvements can be made."
"Controls at airports, baggage checks and data and telecommunications systems are all important and they can all be improved in an attempt to put a stop to terrorist activity."
"But, in my opinion, it is not absolutely clear-cut that effective action is the same as supranational decision."
"A great deal can be achieved through cooperation."
"Europol must cooperate more with Interpol and such cooperation must be based on the wishes of the individual Member States."
"One point which has not come up in this discussion is that neither Europol, the EU nor any other institution can gag the free press."
"The proposal that we should advise the press on how to report terrorist actions cannot, in my view, be accepted."
"Mr President, my dear colleagues, this report is, quite obviously, full of good intentions and also of good sense measures which must necessarily win unanimous support."
"We do not set ourselves apart in this respect."
"But it seems right to add, however, that the analysis of terrorism made in this report is, all the same, very superficial."
"In Europe there are, it seems, some mad cows, but there are also some sacred cows which the rapporteur, quite obviously, has not dared to tackle."
"Terrorism does not seed itself on any social soil any more than violence in general, and that subject has not been broached."
"Many anthropologists and sociologists, such as Arnold Gehlen, have shown that man needs to be surrounded by strong traditions and institutions."
"Otherwise, his violent nature resurfaces extremely quickly."
"That is why uprooting, whether national or social, is therefore an essential cause of violence, but also of terrorism."
"Now, massive immigration from third world countries, as well as the marginalisation of growing sectors of society, caused by globalisation of the economy causing unemployment, are creating a new proletariat."
"This may constitute in the future a veritable reserve army for future terrorism."
"Preventing the constitution of this potential sociological phenomenon would mean combatting the various forms of uprootal caused precisely by European policy."
"We should fight immigration and restore growth within the context of honest competition, against the grain of the current unbridled free-trade policy."
"Finally, we should favour the values of adherence to family, national or religious roots which enable a reduction in violence by channelling behaviour."
"But all this, it seems, is a tabou subject."
"Another tabou, of course: nobody will admit that the fight against terrorism is necessarily a form of war itself and we cannot make war without reintroducing capital punishment."
"It is undoubtedly preferred, as by certain Federal States, Member States, that terrorists commit suicide in prison."
"This also casts a shadow over the democratic legal system."
"This is all hypocritical."
"I think it would be more just, more worthy and more democratic to reintroduce capital punishment for acts of terrorism, when they really do kill."
"These are several tabou subjects which are, I think, also worth mentioning."
"Mr. President, this is not the first time that Parliament has discussed the issue of terrorism, and it is easy to understand why it has been discussed so many times."
"Firstly, this is because a Parliament which has received its mandate through the democratic process naturally finds it unacceptable that anyone should use violence as a means of promoting their aims in a democratic society."
"A second reason is that, for a Parliament which daily discusses its citizens' security and safety, it is a tragedy when an act of terrorism affects ordinary citizens who are not involved in any way in the demands of the terrorist."
"It is meaningless, unjust and totally inhuman."
"Thirdly, terrorism, together with organised crime, forms the greatest barrier to the free movement of European citizens within the Common Market."
"Mr. President, it could easily be said that the task of the Union is to allow the forces of good in Europe to work for peace, a better environment and the health and safety of our people."
"If this is the case, we could never accept the view that evil forces should sabotage this cooperation."
"This is why the fight against organised crime in all its forms is one of the Union's most important joint tasks."
"It is totally incomprehensible to me that Member States are not fully engaged in this task and that we do not fully utilise the available capacity through a better organised cooperation in matters of justice and in the deployment of the police. Instead, we delay the most important first step, which is to ratify the Europol Convention."
"I share Mrs. Reding's irritation over this and I also share the other conclusions drawn in this excellent report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say a few words to express my support and that of my parliamentary group for the report on combating terrorism drafted by Mrs Reding."
"I think it is an excellent report which deals with, assesses and proposes all of the causes and practices and all ways of combating terrorism."
"I should like just highlight four points from this report."
"First of all, the fact that we should not and cannot deal with or look upon terrorist acts as something requiring exceptional procedures or legislation."
"Acts of terrorism in all of their forms should be dealt with by normal judicial processes, like all criminal acts."
"To look upon terrorist acts as crimes which should be dealt with by exceptional legislation means enhancing those acts, going some way to meeting the objectives of those who carry them out."
"That means that we should in these cases harmonise the criminal codes of our States so that there can be no exceptions in any State."
"Secondly, similarly, the highlighting which the media often give to terrorist acts is a very powerful contribution to enhancing and amplifying the intended effects of the terrorists themselves."
"Self-control, I repeat self-control, by the media should lessen the negative effects of giving too much publicity to terrorist activities."
"Thirdly, we should all make a contribution to preventing and combating terrorism worldwide."
"The active defence of human rights, one of main aims of the European Union, would be our best way of contributing to that."
"In that framework it is our prime obligation to defend the European Union against terrorist acts."
"The causes, even when regarded as fully justified, of terrorist acts have always existed and still exist."
"It will always be best to try and find political solutions to deal with any conflicts, however serious they are, since radicalizing positions always leads to violence."
"But if violence is imposed on us then we have to have appropriate means, not just preventive ones, in order effectively to combat terrorist activities."
"In this respect, the objective proposals made in this report should be approved by the European Parliament."
"Fourthly, I should like to point out to Mr Blot that we have the strongest institutions of any political regime existing on earth."
"The institutions are strong, they are very strong, because they are free, built on solidarity and fairness and they work in a democratic way."
"Mr President, I fully endorse the loud condemnation by this House of terrorist activity, all forms of violence and xenophobia, and underhand attempts by governments to colonize peoples and territorial entities or to strangle their legitimate aspirations to freedom, independence and self-determination."
"All the organizational forces of Europe must be set in motion to prevent the spread of terrorism, crime and violence at every level, and to ensure that our new, integrated Europe is based on democracy and individual freedoms."
"This House must be careful to avoid any intentional confusion between legitimate demands for independence - which, in any case, are internationally sanctioned by the Helsinki agreements - and movements or groups or ideologies which have nothing whatever to do with such demands."
"It would be a grave breach of the spirit and letter of the Treaties if this Parliament were to lend itself to dubious manoeuverings designed solely to prevent the birth of a Europe of regions and a Europe of nations."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Reding on a report which has tried to strike a fair balance between the perfectly correct approach of condemning all forms of violence and terrorism but recognizes that in doing so we must not allow our civil rights to be eroded so that the terrorists have, in effect, achieved their objectives."
"It is sometimes said that one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter."
"We can all think of instances in our own lifetimes in certain countries where certain people have been regarded in one light by one group and in another light by another group."
"But we have to draw a distinction - as the report does - between what might have been the case fifty years ago when people were fighting against the horrors of Nazism, for example, or resisting brutal and oppressive regimes, and the use of terrorist activities in open and democratic societies."
"There is no justification whatsoever, as everyone has been saying, for the use of terrorist action in free, open and democratic societies and certainly not acts of terrorism which lead to suffering by innocent people as they so frequently do."
"I also want to emphasize the need in whatever we do to ensure that we do not fall into the error of allowing the terrorists to achieve their objectives."
"Acts of terrorism in the European Union are primarily driven by the desire to disrupt normal society."
"If we introduce security measures of such oppressiveness that normal democratic life is undermined, we are playing into the hands of the terrorists and enabling them to achieve their objectives."
"We must avoid this at all costs."
"It is a difficult balance to keep but I think this report has got it generally right."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Reding for her valuable study of the difficult issue of terrorism which, in view of the wide variety of forms it takes and the general seriousness of the threat it presents, calls for rapidly deepening cooperation throughout Europe and the world at large."
"I am pleased that Finland has shown the will and preparedness to engage in multilateral cooperation in this field, which is covered by the Maastricht Third Pillar."
"Cooperation within Europol on the basis of the Treaty, coordination of asylum policy and wider use of the latest technology to improve the safety of public places and, for example, public transport such as aircraft and trains, as well as to obtain information, are important in preserving the security of Europe's citizens."
"I should like to mention the point stressed by Mrs Reding concerning agreement on the application of a coordinated asylum policy on third country nationals."
"It is worth asking whether it is sensible for endless resources to be spent on processing asylum applications in each Member State even when the applicant may already have been refused asylum in another Member State."
"Given that the central idea of European integration is the creation of a safe living environment and securing freedom of movement for Europe's people, it is essential that the Union should be able to demonstrate credibly that it has the will and the means to defend the right of European citizens to enjoy the fruits of those principles without the threat of terrorism."
"Terrorism is a wide-ranging threat to the security of the civil population, which often increases the sense of insecurity in Europe much more than traditional narrower, mostly military security problems."
"Recent terrorist acts show that the EU must concentrate particularly on eliminating terrorism by Islamic extremists and on obtaining and training experts in this field."
"On the subject of computer terrorism, we may note that ease of information flow has great practical advantages for society, but is also its Achilles' heel because of the difficulty of preventing its use for criminal purposes."
"In terms of Internet connections per head of population, Finland is one of the world leaders, and I believe that my country in particular, given its involvement in high technology, has much to offer in terms of know-how in the use of technology in the joint European effort to destroy terrorism."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Reding for her balanced and comprehensive statement on the problem of terrorism."
"Recital H of the preamble points out that because of the level of democracy we have achieved in this European Union, acts of terrorism cannot be remotely justified on any political or ideological grounds and whatever the motivation may be they are still criminal acts and have to be punished as such."
"She rightly points out that penalties should be in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I live on the border with Northern Ireland and this recital has a particular application to the situation in Northern Ireland where the motivation, in particular for nationalist violence, is political."
"If the people responsible would only stop and think, they would see that within the framework of the European Union, most of the grievances which provoked recourse to violence twenty-five years ago have been or are being redressed at the present time."
"All the citizens of the European Union, wherever they live, enjoy freedoms today that were denied to citizens in many Member States in the past."
"The IRA violence, in particular in Northern Ireland, is solving no problem and is actually preventing the communities in Northern Ireland and the two parts of Ireland from developing and achieving the integration and the removal of borders and barriers that the European Union has made possible."
"In paragraph 9 attention is drawn to the fact that economic, social and cultural exclusion can be a contributing factor to violence."
"In his history of the Northern Ireland problems, an Irish historian, Tim Pat Coogan, supports this thesis, pointing out that most of the young people who have sustained the campaign of violence over the last twenty-five years have come from a small number of ghettos where people are poor and deprived, and the same is true of the violence on the Loyalist side."
"It comes from people brought up in working-class areas with over-crowded and poor conditions."
"Whatever the origin of the violence, the basic right of the citizens of this Union is to be protected from it and it is the duty of this Parliament to ensure that people who commit criminal acts, in particular against the person, will not find refuge in any Member State of this European Union."
"At this point in the development of the Union surely we have developed sufficient common trust in each other to harmonize the legal provisions that are necessary to match the increasing mobility of criminals and the technology that is available to them."
"We must give this task our priority."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Reding for her excellent report."
"There is no justification for terrorism and violence perpetrated by organized groups to obtain political, social or other objectives."
"It is morally and politically unacceptable."
"In a democratic society like Europe, all projects must be lawful and defensible, and progress peacefully with popular support."
"So our rejection of the use of violence to achieve such ends must be absolute."
"We need weapons to fight these violent and organized groups, even more so when we have created a common area without frontiers in the European Union and when we are encouraging free movement of persons."
"Precisely because of this we need to provide ourselves with two additional tools in the fight against violence."
"First, we must create a common police and judicial area where, as stated in the resolution, all the relevant authorities of Member States cooperate, including the police forces responsible, either for the whole country or part of it, for instance the Basque police force itself, the Ertzaintza, which has jurisdiction there."
"And second, legislation must be approximated so that the perpetrators of violent acts cannot find protection and shelter in other Member States."
"Those are the routes to police cooperation."
"To that we add scrupulous respect for human rights in the struggle against violent men and violent acts, and in this way we legitimize our democratic systems."
"As the text of the resolution emphasizes, police action is not enough to resolve deep-seated conflicts in our society."
"Democratic dialogue is necessary, and that is why, in this resolution, the European Parliament calls on the States of the European Union to promote it as a contribution to resolving political conflicts."
"Police action is needed, but in turn, we are creating conditions for inclusive dialogue so that all individuals and groups are clearly aware that their political objectives can be put into practice in a framework of democracy, on one condition: that they have the support of the people, through a democratic majority."
"Mr President, I welcome Mrs Reding's report which illustrates the scars of terror our civilized Europe still bears."
"Many Members of the European Parliament are aware of terrorism in their constituencies as the most flagrant transgression of human rights, and some Members can even testify to suffering it within their own family circle."
"What use is state sovereignty?"
"It is time we recognized that we can only defend life and liberty by pooling all our weapons and one of them is implementing the Europol Convention which will give us the formula to achieve an objective so vital in this day and age."
"In Spain two citizens are being held captive at this very moment by the terrorist group ETA."
"One of them is a civil servant, Mr Ortega Lara, and his wife came to the European Parliament in November to call for the solidarity and support of the President of Parliament and all its Members, which she obtained."
"It is time we left the fine words behind us, as Mrs Reding said, and time we recognized that terrorism thrives in a culture medium which must be destroyed and which we can destroy with political and legal arguments, like the ones Parliament will, I hope, approve by a majority tomorrow."
"It is time to go further than words and recognize that the Europe of the future must be built on respect for the most fundamental rights, like the right to life and the right to freedom."
"So thank you, Mrs Reding, and we hope that tomorrow your report will be passed by a unanimous Parliament."
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last decade, Europe has experienced a wave of terrorist acts."
"The perpetrators have included both local groups and organisations based outside Europe."
"We all have memories of the many hijacks, bombs, murders and kidnappings."
"The reaction to them was an immediate international mobilisation in the fight against terrorism."
"For some of this period, as the Swedish Secretary of State, I was responsible for terrorist issues."
"I was able to see at close quarters the considerable improvements made in our approach to public security throughout Europe."
"Improvements were made in aircraft safety."
"Embassies and other vulnerable buildings also received better protection."
"Decision makers and a variety of people in key positions had to learn to live with personal bodyguards."
"We trained our police and gave our authorities greater resources and power."
"Most important of all was the intensive international anti-terrorist cooperation which was quickly established."
"I am referring to the TREVI agreement for example, which in many respects was the forerunner of current police cooperation within the Union."
"This cooperation has led to the imprisonment of a number of terrorists and the breaking-up of their organisations."
"It has become considerably more difficult for new groups to establish themselves."
"The fight against terrorism is perhaps one of the best examples of how important and successful close international cooperation can be in the fight against organised crime."
"Naturally, the positive political developments which have taken place in recent years in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union and in Eastern and Central Europe have also played a large part in this."
"I completely agree with Mrs. Reding when she stresses, in her report, the importance of finding political solutions to the conflicts which feed terrorism."
"We must also tackle the fundamental causes of terrorism."
"But terrorism is still a very serious concern both within and outside Europe."
"It is true that the number of international terrorist acts has decreased during the last decade but the number of victims has tended to increase."
"We could say that the trend is for fewer, but more serious international terrorist acts."
"The subject of terrorism has been raised on a number of occasions as part of the EU's cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mrs. Reding's report mentions the La Gomera declaration against terrorism which the Council of Ministers adopted in October 1995."
"Like Mrs. Reding's report, this declaration underlines the importance of a joint initiative in the fight against terrorism."
"The most important current issue is that terrorism be included as part of Europol's area of responsibility once the Convention comes into force."
"I noted with satisfaction that Mrs. Reding, together with many other speakers in this assembly, is urging Member States to ratify the Europol Convention as soon as possible."
"So far only Great Britain has ratified."
"The Irish Presidency urged all Member States to ratify the Convention during 1997."
"I would like to add that I consider it extremely important that we work on the Extradition Convention in parallel with the Europol Convention as this is also important if we wish to tackle the issue of terrorism in its entirety."
"The Reding report is therefore both timely and important."
"The fight against terrorism must continue to be a matter of high priority in the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"Progress of the EU in 1995"
"The next item is the report (A4-0396/96) by Mr Valverde Lopez, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the report of the European Council to the European Parliament on the progress of the European Union in 1995 (pursuant to Article D of the Treaty on European Union) (C4-0409/96)."
"Mr President, this annual debate on the progress of the European Union in 1995 is pursuant to article D of the Treaty of Maastricht. One of its principal innovations was to make the European Council responsible for providing the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and defining its general political guidelines."
"Furthermore the treaty requirement that the European Council present an annual report on the progress of the Union clearly indicates an obligation of dialogue between the European Council and Parliament."
"For this dialogue to be effective in the future, the European Council must undertake to complete its annual report at the December summit and the European Parliament must show the political flexibility and awareness to organize a major general debate in its February or March part-session every year."
"In yet another year the European Council has to be reminded here and now that its functions are clearly different from those of the Council of the European Union and its annual report cannot therefore be a mere catalogue of the year's activities but should assess the political action taken and set out the political objectives and key ideas to be communicated to the public."
"There must be an open dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council to discuss the general political guidelines for the year in progress."
"The political action of the Union would emerge from this dialogue strengthened and doubly legitimized."
"At this crucial time of consolidation of the European Union it is very important for clear, precise and definite messages to reach the citizens about the great political objectives of the Union."
"As in any enterprise, the stability of a clearly defined horizon is essential."
"The major problem for the construction of Europe at this time, above all vis-√†-vis public opinion, lies in the nationalist way some Heads of Government are interpreting it for their respective electorates, frequently obfuscating and undermining the institutional agreements."
"A clear message of support for many of the agreements made in the European Councils must go out from this Parliament, together with criticism and condemnation of those Heads of Government who are failing to show due loyalty to the institutional agreements, hence conveying confusion and insecurity to the public."
"Furthermore, Mr President, these slanted and partial interpretations are unfortunately becoming the favourite issue for much of the media, because some of the ideas being expressed are scandalous and destabilizing."
"Debates like this one on the state of the Union should send hopeful messages about the future to the citizens, stressing that while the European Council and Parliament may differ on occasion and on specific points, they are united on the great objectives of political union."
"It should be made clear here and now that both institutions support the various objectives set out in the motion for a resolution drafted by the Committee on Institutional Affairs with wide agreement between all the political groups - and I thank the members for their contributions and support."
"It summarizes the current position of the European Parliament on the essential challenges facing the Union in the area of economic and monetary union, employment, the internal market, citizenship, common foreign policy, justice and internal affairs, enlargement and the great issue of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Briefly, Parliament's proposals can be described as coinciding with the objectives approved at the Madrid European Council, which drew up 'Agenda 2000' , and we consider it of the utmost benefit to fulfil each and every one of its goals, as well as the specific aims added later by the Florence and Dublin European Councils."
"This Parliament believes it is essential to confirm to the public that it shares in the great objectives established by the European Council, supports compliance with the deadlines and conditions laid down for overcoming the various problems at each stage, and condemns any attempt by any Head of State or of Government to reverse decisions already agreed or confuse issues already settled with issues at the planning stage."
"To sum up, Mr President, the European Parliament supports the agreement on the single currency, and supports the enlargement - which it regards as an historic opportunity to unify Europe politically - but reminds the European Council that the Intergovernmental Conference must give the Union the tools needed to complete the enlargement successfully."
"It is also essential to make justice and internal policy a Community policy, as we have stressed repeatedly in this Parliament, and to create a European legal area as part of a vital strategy to fight terrorism and the drug traffic. That was made very clear in the previous debate."
"There must be emphasis, too, on the common foreign and security policy so that it advances along the lines laid down in the Maastricht Treaty."
"The European Council must take on board the fact that existing cooperation mechanisms have been a failure and decisive progress needs to be made in the process of integration."
"Finally, Mr President, the citizens need to be reassured that the European Council is determined to extend European citizenship rights, and - just in passing - the European Commission's current information campaign deserves our praise."
"There are other issues, but colleagues will be dealing with them, so I shall not dwell on them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the written report by the Council is laid down in the EU Treaty."
"However, the annual debate on that report in the European Parliament must not be allowed to degenerate into a formality."
"I should therefore like to use today's debate as an opportunity to talk about specific prospects for our shared European future, taking my cue from important events of the year 1995."
"First, the enlargement to 15 Member States."
"This successful advance also served as a signal, highlighting the need to restructure our Community and the changed political conditions."
"As we know, these subjects are now being discussed by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Secondly, the activities of the Reflection Group, chaired by Carlos Westendorp, with two members of the European Parliament."
"This gave a clear signal that the reconstruction in question can no longer be achieved without the participation of the peoples of the European Union and their democratically elected representatives."
"That is why the results of the Intergovernmental Conference must also meet the requirements of the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, the resolute commitment of the European Council in Madrid that monetary union should become a reality."
"We are following with careful, though not uncritical, attention what the Council is now doing to implement those resolutions."
"Fourthly, the setting of a political agenda for future years - Intergovernmental Conference, monetary union, negotiations on enlargement and the revision of the financial forecast and own resources."
"In the light of this agenda, the Amsterdam summit in mid-June must bring fundamental reforms for the European Union."
"However, 1995 has also left a legacy of problems that are still completely unresolved."
"One of them is the weakness of Europe's external policy, which is really rooted in the inability of 15 governments to take joint action - think about Yugoslavia."
"Another, the biggest of all, is the social disaster of unemployment."
"In 1995, as indeed in 1996, unemployment was a priority topic for the European Council, yet no tangible successes were achieved."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must, therefore, come up with improvements - a new chapter on employment policy and an end to the United Kingdom's social opt-out."
"But that will not be enough. As part of our Community-wide coordination, the Member States must accept their responsibility for an upturn in the employment market."
"Political democracy and the welfare state are still inseparable foundations of further European integration."
"Mr President, I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for having written a critical report."
"I have nothing to add to his criticism except to say that I shall be unreservedly voting in favour."
"I would however like to single out one point, contained in Section 34 of the report, where the rapporteur deplores the lack of goodwill manifested by the Council during the Intergovernmental Conference."
"My view is that this lack of goodwill is based on a fundamental confusion, a lack of clarity regarding the objective which the European Union adopted as its own at Maastricht: eliminating the division of the European continent by laying the foundations of the future European structure."
"The Maastricht Treaty itself states the principles on which those foundations are based: the United Nations Charter, the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, and the Paris Charter."
"To adopt those foundations has serious consequences, because they can no longer be implemented in the form of a traditional foreign and security policy, although attempts are still being made to do so, but only in the creation of a domain of peace, something that does not yet exist, even if only in the form of the Europe of the future."
"I am sorry to say - and I will say it, even in the Commissioner's presence - that I looked in vain in the Dublin II Council documents for any hint of awareness of this mighty challenge!"
"Mr President, the report on the progress of the Union in 1995 which we are examining today analyses European policy according to a rather distorted reading detectable right from the first preamble. The Union should rest upon both democratic legitimacy, expressed in the European Parliament, and on the legitimacy of the States, expressed in the Council."
"This presentation, as standard as it is, still hides the essence."
"A primary legitimacy exists which goes before the two others but which is not cited often enough, that of the national parliaments."
"It constitutes now and will for a long time to come, really until a European people exists, the principal legitimacy, as the decree of the German Constitutional Court given in October 1993 on the Treaty of Maastricht recalls."
"This primary legitimacy does not only have an indirect effect on the Union through the repsonsibility of national governments, it also has a direct effect, since it is the national parliaments and often the people themselves who ratify the Treaty to which the European Parliament is subject, like all other institutions of the Union."
"This subordinated role has to be recalled to explain why it is perfectly logical, contrary to the assertions of the report, for the European Parliament to be distanced from the negociating table at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is also necessary to contest the request expressed by the report to extend the European Parliament's power of codecision for all acts of a legislative nature."
"Indeed, although elected by universal suffrage, our Assembly represents people taken as a whole and not citizens considered in an equal manner."
"Furthermore, it only has a secondary legitimacy compared with that of national parliaments, and in no way could it substitute them."
"One wonders whether the fact that this primary truth and this primary legitimacy have been forgotten is one of the principal causes of the democratic deficit in the Union."
"Mr President, this is a moving moment for me as it is my maiden speech in the European Parliament, the first time I have taken the floor in a debate."
"It is with great pleasure that I take part in a debate on the future development of the European Union."
"I have always been strongly committed to the development of the European Union."
"When I was a student I was one of those coordinating the campaign for a Yes vote in the United Kingdom referendum on its continued membership of the European Union."
"Indeed, I led a delegation of students all the way to Rome to demonstrate in 1975 outside a European Council meeting in favour of holding direct elections to this very Parliament which was under consideration at that meeting."
"Later I spoke at the big demonstration which took place outside the European Parliament at the first ever sitting of the directly elected Parliament in Strasbourg in 1979 and later still I had the privilege of working for Parliament, indeed for the very committee - the Committee on Institutional Affairs - which has produced the report we are considering tonight."
"At that time it was drawing up the Spinelli report with the draft Treaty of European Union."
"It is not that many years ago but we have come a long way since then."
"This report looks at how far we came in one particular year - in 1995."
"If I have one reservation about participating in this debate, it is that I do not believe we should be having this particular debate in this particular format."
"We are after all discussing the events of 1995 and it is now the beginning of 1997."
"Furthermore, we are discussing a report on a report."
"We are discussing a report of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on the report of the European Council on the events of 1995 which is quite some time ago."
"I do not think this is a very sensible procedure for Parliament."
"It would make much more sense simply to discuss the European Council's report as such in plenary when we receive it, presented perhaps by the Council or the European Council at that time and wind up the debate with a resolution to close the debate on the subject then, not draw up a report on a report and debate it a year later when the issues are long since forgotten."
"If I look at the beginning of this report, it refers to the fact that we already have an annual report on the common foreign and security policy with a resolution, an annual report on justice and home affairs with a resolution, and at every European Council meeting we have a debate which tends to be a general debate on the state of the Union."
"We have an annual debate on the state of the Union as such."
"We have a debate at the beginning of every Council presidency which is generally on where we are now and where we should go and we have a debate on the Commission's programme at the beginning of each year."
"This seems to me to be an excessive number of general debates on the state of the Union and with an additional one now on what happened almost two years ago, despite the hard work put in - and I pay tribute to the rapporteur in doing this every year, it is no criticism of the rapporteur's hard work - it seems to me that we should be reviewing our procedures on this point."
"I will be tabling an amendment to the Rules of Procedure to try to tighten our procedures on this point."
"Thank you Mr Corbett and congratulations on your maiden speech."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Richard Corbett on his maiden speech."
"Perhaps surprisingly, I agreed with all his substantive remarks and I hope he will agree with mine."
"I agree with much of this resolution but perhaps I could depart from the polite conventions of this House by concentrating on what I disagree with."
"I have no difficulties with the first line of the resolution."
"The problems start in the second line which talks of the 'progress' of the European Union, as if the Union must always be moving forward."
"We have to ask: ' Progress toward what?' and 'Who is driving this movement?'"
"Many more matters are already resolved at European level than most people in Europe realize."
"The process of integration is overwhelmingly driven by an elite of politicians, including those represented in the Council of Ministers."
"But for all the talk in the resolution about strengthening democratic legitimacy, it is not clear that this pace of integration has the consent of the vast majority of EU citizens."
"It certainly seems to me bizarre to state in Recital F that 'the sole appropriate response' to nationalism and economic and social uncertainty is 'to move ahead with European integration' ."
"This seems to me to be theology not politics and derives from faith and not reason."
"Such talk makes a nonsense of the frequent protestations of European politicians from all institutions since Maastricht that the EU should not attempt to take on new powers but should simply strive to do what it does now better."
"We know that the pace of European integration will grow a good deal faster with economic and monetary union, something that is uncritically welcomed in the resolution."
"In 1995 the fiscal and political implications of EMU seem hardly to have been considered."
"We heard earlier from Commissioner Oreja that the Commission is only just beginning to think about its implications."
"EMU represents a serious ratcheting up of European powers in all areas."
"We know that EU citizens have serious reservations about EMU but they are sleep-walking into it without a proper debate."
"They are simply told that there is no need for a debate because the decision was taken years ago by a few politicians in Maastricht."
"I know that my views are in the minority in my group and in Parliament but people who care seriously about the success of the EU - as I do - in reviewing the Council's performance in 1995, or when we come to review its performance in 1997 on the eve of the next millennium, should be saying very clearly that Europe must slow down."
"If the Euro-elite continues to gallop down the road of 'ever closer union' , which inevitably must end in a single European state, without carrying the peoples of Europe with it, I very much fear that it will all end in tears."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Valverde, on his excellent work. He especially deserves congratulation for making a political assessment of the main issues the European Union institutions are confronting today."
"And I was delighted to be able to hear Mr Corbett's first speech, because I had the pleasure of working with him for many years in the Parliament and I am very glad to see him here today making a speech of such political purpose and clear vision about the way reports of this kind should be dealt with in the future."
"I entirely share Mr Valverde's position on the purpose of the exercise provided for under article D of the Treaty on European Union."
"We should not be unnecessarily duplicating Community publications which already cover all the activities of the Union."
"I refer to the general report on the business of the European Union, the 1996 edition of which will be available as from 11 February, and the monthly bulletin of the European Union."
"Instead, the European Council report should, as the rapporteur said, make a political assessment of the Union's progress and its difficulties and define some general political guidelines on that basis."
"Mr Valverde has set all this out very clearly and, fundamentally, the Commission associates itself with the broad lines of his report."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission in fact takes the view that specific employment provisions should be included in the treaty, that the promotion of public services, a key element in the European model of society, should be one of the objectives of the treaty, and that the Union should provide itself with the appropriate legal basis so that it can combat fraud against the financial interests of the Communities effectively."
"Locating citizenship at the heart of the European Union is also a constant concern of the Commission, in line with its statement of 28 February 1996 on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And Mr Sch√§fer is absolutely right to mention the work of the Westendorp Group in this connection, because that was indeed the starting point and that group specifically dwelt on what is meant by the status and role of citizen."
"It is vitally important to eliminate obstacles to free movement of persons, and to bring cooperation in a wide range of justice and internal affairs issues under Community responsibility, as well as strengthening the Union's ability to act in other areas of the third pillar."
"The Commission also believes the Union's decision-making process needs to become simpler and more democratic, and more transparent and intelligible to the citizen."
"With this in mind, the Commission recommended extending the scope of codecision to all Community legislation in its report of last June."
"I think there are two kinds of legitimacy and I wanted to mention that to Mr Berthu when he was talking about legitimacy. There is the legitimacy of the States and the legitimacy of the people."
"And because of this twofold legitimacy, the national parliaments have a very important function and so does the European Parliament."
"The construction of a strong external identity is another aim shared by the European Parliament and the Commission, and Mr Ullman referred to it in his speech."
"Some common objectives need to be set for this purpose, but that may not be easy to negotiate."
"More coherent external action must be guaranteed - and I want to stress that particularly."
"The Union's resources for action must be strengthened, especially in trade policy."
"And our common foreign and security policy must be developed by creating a common analysis unit and extending qualified majority voting to this area."
"Finally, we must gradually build up a security and defence identity."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the Commission fully shares the rapporteur's view that the future of the European Union, including economic and monetary union and the success of the enlargement depends above all on some good results at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Serious reform is not a luxury that institutions indulge in to boost their own importance."
"It is the only way the Union can obtain the resources it needs to defend its interests in the world, to respond to the aspirations of its citizens and to welcome in the candidate countries."
"And I am delighted to say, Mr Valverde, that your report sustains and encourages the Commission in its daily endeavours to achieve these objectives at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, as we are discussing a Council report should we not receive a response from the Council?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"Traditionally they do not respond to this debate."
"I do not know why this tradition exists but it does."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"Cultural aspects in European Community action"
"The next item is the report (A4-0410/96) by Mr Escudero, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the first report by the Commission on the consideration of cultural aspects in European Community action (COM(96)0160 - C4-0249/96)."
"Mr President, the starting point of this report is the affirmation of interdependence between cultural action and political action in the European Union, and I would like to set out its general lines."
"It is well-known that the integration process was originally built on economic interests, but since the Treaty of Maastricht the achievement of European citizenship has become a fundamental and highly significant objective."
"Throughout the political history of the West, the acquisition of citizenship has always been linked to existence of an ideological and cultural community."
"So the cultural reference in the text is not some intellectual adornment, but the very core and raison d'√™tre of the European citizenship we are seeking."
"If no cultural and ideological framework exists, there is no Community policy, and if there is no Community policy, there is no European citizenship."
"The Treaty on Union refers to culture in article 3, article 92 and, above all, the important article 128, which constitutes the new Title IX devoted to culture."
"This article provides that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national diversity, encouraging cooperation between Member States, supporting and supplementing their action in a number of areas and fostering cooperation with third countries on these issues."
"Now, Community action in all those areas which are not within its exclusive competence, as culture obviously is not, remains subject, under article 3 b of the treaty, to the principle of subsidiarity, so that it can only intervene in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States."
"This means Community action must be geared to the principle of subsidiarity and as that principle does not have empirical form but is a conceptual construction, Community action must consequently be geared to the interpretation applied to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Here we recognize a flexible interpretation because a rooted and rigid one would actually make participation impossible in practice, while in any case it must keep to the limits laid down in the said article 128."
"Finally, examination of Community cultural action goes beyond existing direct programmes - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael, which certainly deserve praise and encouragement - and involves any administrative and financial act which has any repercussions on culture."
"Sustained Community action must be promoted to benefit the cultures of Europe, respecting the initiative of the Member States and also respecting the historical and linguistic identity of the peoples."
"So the establishment of a clause whereby all Community acts and actions which may have a cultural impact must be compatible with cultural objectives, as proposed in this report, makes sense, as does the Community entering into constructive dialogue with all the bodies - universities, academies, foundations, etc, concerned with culture."
"Historical anomalies and misunderstandings would thus be overcome, creating a social climate of harmony, freedom, tolerance and respect on which it will be possible to consolidate the democratic values of political coexistence."
"In conclusion, Mr President, during examination in committee this report was particularly open to the suggestions, comments and amendments of members of the various political groups, and it was approved unanimously."
"Three amendments have been tabled in the meantime: one by Mrs Pack restored some words which accidentally vanished from my text, on eradicating illiteracy and promoting appropriate policy on books."
"Obviously I am very much in agreement with this amendment which restores the original text."
"I also agree with Mr Perry's amendment to the proposal for the Commission to have experts draw up a school textbook on the history of Europe, in that it should be recommended for, rather than imposed on, the educational programmes of Member States."
"But I do not subscribe to the new text that Mr Perry proposes for paragraph 18, which deals with investment in works of art to adorn public construction projects and is the result of an intelligent amendment by Mr Aparicio. It is very ambitious and attainable in time, as part of the task we have set ourselves of restoring the role of culture in the life of Europe."
"Mr President, many citizens and Members of Parliament believe in the existence of European culture."
"This land enjoys the spiritual heritage of Aristotle and the Greeks, then came the Roman Empire and Christianity, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Romantic Movement, the Scientific Movement, the liberating ideas of the Eighteenth Century and the egalitarian ideas of the Nineteenth Century. This land has more in common than geography and trade."
"Many of us believe in the existence of European culture and we are not ashamed to say so."
"But we are on the defensive, Mr President."
"You will not hear European culture mentioned without someone immediately adding 'based on diversity and respect for the plurality of cultures' ."
"Obviously no culture is worthy of the name if it does not respect the diversity of cultures."
"But equally obviously, in our view, we should be talking about European culture, something which - as I said - represents more than shared geography and trade."
"Why are we on the defensive when we talk about it?"
"Because terrible atrocities have been committed in our own century, in the name of culture, along with uniformity and authoritarianism."
"Obviously the European Union could not be further away from that kind of thing."
"But in that connection, I believe Europeans are united by a system of knowledge, belief, and thought, covering morality, history, customs, everything that shapes culture, and we would not have come this far from the bloodstained and divided Europe of the 'forties if that European culture did not exist."
"So I think Mr Escudero's report is admirable. His rigorous and erudite approach, demonstrated in his five minute summary before I spoke, exemplifies European thought."
"A report like this can hardly fail to achieve the virtual unanimity that Mr Escudero has achieved."
"I particularly like point 18 of the motion for a resolution, and point 23 about a school textbook."
"When will the flame be lighted which makes the process of European Union irreversible?"
"When children no longer think of Europe as 'an organization my country belongs to' but think of Europe as 'my country' ."
"When a Danish child thinks of Mozart as 'one of my country's geniuses' , when a Spaniard thinks of Goethe as 'one of my country's philosophers' or when a Greek thinks of Picasso or an English child thinks of Pasteur as 'distinguished figures from my country: Europe' ."
"This can be achieved through teaching methods and this common history textbook which would additional to national history textbooks, and recommended for inclusion in the curriculum."
"So in my opinion the whole report is excellent."
"Mr President, the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Union for the first time a competence in cultural issues and we would all agree that European culture not only merits but needs our support."
"European culture is under siege from Atlanticist values."
"We can admire America and things American but it still remains vital to protect and promote our own cultures here in Europe."
"I was very struck when former French Culture Minister Mr Toubon addressed the European Parliament back in 1995 and said that we were in danger of rearing a Nintendo generation."
"He was right and I share his concerns."
"We should also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Commissioner Oreja and the former DirectorGeneral of DG XX, Miss Flesch, for the work they have done in protecting and promoting Europe's culture."
"While I broadly support Mr Escudero's report, I have some slight reservations."
"For instance, I am not convinced that cultural policy should be by majority voting in Council."
"It is our individual national cultures that make the rich patchwork of Europe's culture."
"National interests should have the right to protect their own cultures as they see fit."
"The distinctive feature of Europe's culture is its national diversity."
"Similarly I do not believe that a school textbook on the history of Europe should be made a compulsory subject for study in all the Member States."
"I recognize it might be useful for instance for English pupils at long last to learn how, despite winning all the critical battles in the Hundred Years War such as Agincourt and Crecy, somehow or other we managed to lose the war."
"But that should not be done by compulsory textbooks drawn up by the Commission."
"I appreciate the remarks that Mr Escudero made and I believe he was accepting the amendment."
"The report also urges that 1 % of EU expenditure on public works should go on works of art to adorn the said public work."
"I do not say that we should never have works of art in public places at public expense but I do not think it is always appropriate and I have proposed an amendment that would limit it to only where appropriate."
"Where I totally agree with my colleague - and I say this as budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media - is that we need to increase the overall funding allocated to the culture sector."
"Europe's cultural heritage not only needs and deserves more funding in its own right but because the culture sector is additionally an important generator of economic growth and employment throughout our continent."
"That is a message that must be heard not only by the Commission but by the Council and - I am sorry to say - by this Parliament as well."
"I have to announce that I shall be calling the Commissioner after we have heard the group representatives and he will be the last speaker before the break."
"The debate will continue after the break."
"I apologise in particular to Mr Evans who will be the first speaker affected by this."
"Mr President, as my colleagues have done already, I am also keen to congratulate rapporteur Escudero for his work, with which the UPE group is in perfect agreement."
"Indeed we can only be delighted at the fact that the cultural dimension and the definition of increasingly specific European cultural objectives are being taken into consideration, among European policies as a whole."
"The road is long, and if we already have positive results to show in the domain of artistic and historic heritage, in that of the protection of authors, the circulation of works of art, the development of reading and many other areas, we must be vigilant and increasingly determined."
"Access to culture and the notion of cultural membership are essential conditions for the full participation of citizens in the life of society."
"But be warned, the very rapid evolution towards the information society demands increased vigilance of the Community to promote this European cultural identity as much through the networks as through the services offered."
"Personally, I am delighted at the fact that finally the economic impact, particularly on employment, of the cultural action of the Union, is beginning to be considered."
"If the environmental dimension is omnipresent in references to European policy, let us also introduce the cultural dimension wherever possible and let us evaluate regularly the effect of this dimension."
"Let us be concerned for the safeguarding and protection of our European languages, let us export our literary, musical and audiovisual works outside the Union."
"Let us act favourably towards the promotion of those cultural activities, which increase the value of our European style."
"Let us share our cultural objectives with countries asking for entry into Europe now."
"Do not be afraid of broadcasting our cultures. They are the origins of the life of our civilisations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the EU is not able to improve the effectiveness of its cultural policy within the terms of the Maastricht Treaty and in the manner intended by the Treaty's articles on culture, the best objectives and values of the Union will fail to be realized."
"We need data from economic research to convince doubters of the close link between culture and the economy and the stimulating effect which culture has on the economy."
"The most important support for culture comes from the structural funds through the regional development programmes."
"If regional decision-makers have a coherent overall vision of the prerequisites for development, they will include cultural and educational projects as an essential part of development programmes."
"In this way new jobs will be created, the quality of life and of the environment will be improved and exclusion will be prevented"
"The basis of the EU's cultural policy is still the protection and enhancement of cultural and linguistic diversity."
"A rich diversity is at the core of the European identity."
"We do not need any standardizing Euro-culture."
"Instead we need a better understanding of culture, knowledge of each other and the acceptance of difference."
"In terms of the EU's cultural and educational policy, respecting the subsidiarity principle means striving towards common objectives on the basis of our own cultural identity and in the framework of our own structures."
"For this reason we cannot approve the proposal contained in the draft resolution for a common European history textbook as a compulsory subject for study in schools."
"On the other hand the underlying idea of the great importance of teaching European history in the interest of promoting mutual understanding and tolerance is a good one."
"Mr. President, I am a great advocate of cultural initiatives and international cultural exchanges."
"For this reason, there are many sections in this report which I can support."
"But there are also sections which are totally alien to me."
"Europe has many cultures."
"This report talks about a European culture and a European cultural identity , but there is no such thing."
"There is no basis for the belief that the EU boundary also forms a natural cultural boundary."
"Why should we have more in common with someone from an EU country than we do with someone from Hungary, or Argentina for that matter?"
"To uphold the view that there is special European culture is one way of evoking an artificial basis for 'Euronationalism' and a European State."
"I believe that such attempts are doomed to failure."
"Culture in an open democratic society is not created by decree."
"This is why the view, discussed in the report, that we should create a European culture through majority decision making in the Council of Ministers came as such a surprise and shock to me."
"For me this is an absurd idea."
"Equally absurd are the plans to introduce common, obligatory material for schools covering European history."
"The peoples of Europe do not have one common history."
"What is more, the production of teaching aids is not a matter for the EU, but one for the Member States."
"The thought that the EU's Council of Ministers should sit down and decide in detail what each pupil should learn at school is, for me, totally incompatible with the diversity, openness and democracy which represents the best of Europe."
"Mr President, many, many times, we have recalled our wish to see the European Union's competence strengthened regarding culture."
"This wish, expressed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and written by our Parliament into its resolution regarding the IGC, appears not to have been honoured today by negotiators from the Member States."
"The idea is nevertheless gaining ground and this first report by the Commission on the consideration of cultural aspects can give us the hope that one day we will see culture given recognition as a structural element in the construction of Europe."
"And even if we are not there yet, we should nevertheless congratulate the European Commission on this initiative."
"I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner, but I would also like to include Mr Escudero, our rapporteur, in these congratulations, for the quality of his work."
"It is a matter of taking our bearings from Article 128 which marks the establishment of a legal basis specific to culture in the Treaty of Union."
"However, and we are sorry for this, the subject of this report does not concern the whole of Article 128, but only paragraph 4."
"It is not, then, a question of evaluating the activities carried out by all the specific cultural programmes, but of seeing how far Community policy takes account of cultural aspects in its action in the name of other arrangements."
"Starting from the evolving notion of the concept of culture, the Commission is drawing up a precise, though partial, inventory of the impact of culture in all the spheres of activity of the Union."
"We could mention for the record those of basic freedoms, taxation, competition policy, the circulation of property, and that's not all."
"Of course, we should add to these the consideration of culture in the structural fund, which is a fundamental matter."
"Concerning this, we have been pleased to learn that most Community policies have a cultural dimension."
"Nevertheless, I would like make my own several criticisms of Mr Escudero."
"Can we really confine ourselves to these too generous comments and to the oft reiterated principle of considering the coherence of internal policies and their compatibility."
"I also think that, as our rapporteur recommends, Article 128 should be considered in its entirety and the demand should be made that it is better applied, in particular by the introduction of the vote by a qualified majority in Council."
"In other respects, consideration of cultural aspects is still not sufficient and it would be appropriate to retain the legal basis of Article 128 for any legislative act relating to culture."
"To conclude, I would like to make a more personal comment."
"As I said, I recognise the praiseworthy efforts of the Commission towards imposing respect for culture, for our culture."
"Nevertheless, I think that we should, before all else, think about what we mean by this word."
"By trying to see everything through cultural eyes, I am afraid that we are emptying it little by little of its substance."
"Nowadays, everything is culture, and since culture should be the opposite of nature, culture should therefore characterise all human activity."
"I fear that reality forces a little more modesty upon us."
"If you cast your net too wide, you risk catching too many sprats, as the saying goes."
"I would like our efforts essentially to be focused upon creation, genuine creation. Of course we must safeguard our heritage."
"But we must also aid artistic creation in Europe."
"In this world of the ephemeral, the virtual, in which the production of events takes precedence over the completion of a work, it is perhaps time also that we help creators, that we favour the practice of culture."
"And we know how many people are excluded from it."
"We could thereby reconcile culture and education, culture and society, culture and economics, and labour effectively towards extending the influence of European culture."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"There are few if any people in this House who have greater respect for you than I do but perhaps you could clarify a point for me."
"Unless he possess psychic powers or is telepathic, how is the Commissioner going to reply to the debate before he has heard all the speakers and all the hard-hitting arguments which will be made after he has spoken?"
"It may be that I have misunderstood the situation but I am sure you will clear things up for me."
"It is a fair comment."
"I am sure the Commission will read the speeches of those who speak after he replies and if there are points he wants to respond to I am sure he will do so in writing."
"Unfortunately that is the only way we can proceed."
"It is always unsatisfactory to split a debate but in view of the time we have no option but to do so."
"We cannot keep the interpreters and other staff here indefinitely and the debate would have to run on for another twenty minutes if we took all the speakers."
"I am very sorry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work and also on the speech he made here, which was clear, concise and comprehensive, and very helpful to our work."
"And I also want to say that I concur in recognizing the importance of this debate which represents an important stage in establishing the cultural policy of the European Community."
"I also want to thank him for having highlighted the quality of the Commission's work."
"The Commission has been occupied for some time in drawing up the report relating to article 128.4, but in reality that work is merely a first attempt to assess the magnitude of the Community's commitment in the cultural area."
"The Commission's objective was to initiate a debate on the scope of new article 128 of the treaty and then draw the conclusions, exercising its right of initiative."
"We are delighted both with this motion for a resolution from Parliament and for the resolution recently approved by the Council of Ministers."
"And I want to say to Mr Escudero that the Commission agrees with the majority of the considerations that appear in his report, that is, the considerations on cultural aspects, which now constitute an obligation on the Community."
"Obviously the principle of subsidiarity must be respected, but not used to put a brake on Community action in the cultural field."
"Culture should also fulfil an important function in European integration."
"We cannot claim that the citizen should be at the heart of the construction of Europe and then leave out culture and all the values - humanism, democracy, human rights, tolerance - on which the European model of society is based."
"Culture is also a factor in social cohesion and can contribute to the fight against unemployment and social exclusion, as Mr Perry mentioned when he said culture plays a role in creating jobs."
"And I have specifically asked my staff to prepare a Green Paper on the relationship between culture and employment, which I hope to be in a position to present towards the end of the year."
"The Commission notes with the greatest interest the rapporteur's proposals on the application of paragraph 4 of article 128, and I can assure you I will take them very much into account in exercising the right of initiative and executing Community policies."
"And in this sense, we think that any action with repercussions on culture should reconcile its own objectives with the cultural objectives of the Community."
"For example, a structural funds operation with cultural impact should contribute to regional development, respect the specific cultural aspects in the processes of education and distribution. and have European scope and visibility."
"Community cultural action should demonstrate to Europeans the importance of their common roots and the role played by educational exchanges on our cultural heritage, as highlighted by Mr Aparicio in his splendid speech."
"It should also encourage the formation of cultural cooperation networks, called for by the rapporteur, which can make real achievements possible."
"And here I think you are absolutely right to talk about the role of the universities."
"The idea of creating Jean Monnet Chairs of comparative European cultural history is an initiative which must be carried through to a conclusion."
"Furthermore, the proposal to convert future cultural programmes into integrated programmes, in other words, associate measures taken in the framework of the cohesion, training and technology policies with cultural action as such, also deserves to be taken fully into account."
"Mr President, the Commission takes note of the invitation from Parliament and the Council to adopt internal mechanisms to guarantee fulfilment of the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 128 through a cultural compatibility clause. This clause will facilitate greater coordination between all Community measures which may have repercussions in the cultural sphere and, hence, better integration of culture into Community action."
"I will soon be proposing a mechanism of this kind to the Commission and it will be inspired by what has already been achieved in a similar way in the environmental sphere."
"Finally, the Commission takes note of the call by Parliament and the Council for an annual report on how cultural aspects have been taken into consideration in Community actions."
"And to end, I want to congratulate Mr Escudero again on his excellent work, and tell you that the Commission's report and the resolutions from the Council and Parliament represent an important stage in what the rapporteur called the recognition and consecration of the role of culture in the construction of Europe."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 8.10 p.m and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I should like to welcome you to the debate."
"I am sorry you missed the first part of it and also that the rapporteur is not here to hear the continuation."
"Nevertheless, I wish to speak in support of the report by Mr Escudero."
"While many people believe that the European Union is only about business, about making money and about international trade, there are many of us who believe that there is more to it than that."
"Certainly in the UK but also in other countries, there are serious doubts at the moment and murmurings about the whole concept of the European Union."
"While it is always the politicians and the industrialists who think they make the decisions, it is the people who make the real decisions and if we are to carry the citizens of Europe with us we have to involve them and make them feel part of the European Union."
"We do not do this by highlighting our differences."
"Of course I accept and respect the differences - our different languages, our individual histories, the various religions of Europe and our separate cultures."
"But we must highlight and build on the similarities."
"Europe as a continent has a common history shaped by the Romans, the ancient Greeks, modern wars, etc. but we also share a cultural history and we must recognize this."
"Most of the European languages share words, phrases, grammar and other similarities."
"It is the similarities that bind us together and ultimately will be the key to Europe's success."
"When the sample designs of the single currency notes were released last year, many people were unhappy."
"Never mind that the individual designs on the banknotes are irrelevant to the real debate about European Union, the artists had recognized and acknowledged our common European architectural heritage, something we all try to preserve and protect."
"Therefore I believe, as does this report, that it is important that we take increased and coordinated action in this field."
"It is what the report calls for."
"We must teach our children and young people about other languages and other cultures."
"By doing this, we can counter the very strong and negative forces that exist."
"These forces, if unchecked, will lead to a further rise in racism, fascism and xenophobia."
"This was evident recently in the British press with some of the ill-informed and unhelpful coverage of paragraph 23 of Mr Escudero's report."
"My group will be supporting Amendment No 3 to tidy up this part and to remove any ambiguities but the principle is still a strong one."
"It is important in a union of fifteen countries that we teach our children about our common history and heritage."
"Sometimes, but not always, this will mean looking at arguments from both sides."
"It means also that we must learn something of the history and the struggles of people in other lands."
"My group will also be support Amendment No 1 calling for zero rating for VAT on books and newspapers - a strong principle."
"A country or society that taxes the printed word is leaning in a dangerous direction and it is one that must be challenged."
"This is a comprehensive and powerful report and the Socialist Group is happy to support it, as I hope Parliament will."
"Mr President, not having had previous parliamentary experience I stood for election to the European Parliament because I believed in the European dream."
"I came here in order to be closer to the source, closer to the place where decisions are made which could shape - for better or for worse - our own lives."
"From my point of view this is one of the most important reports being debated this year in the European Parliament."
"But how many people will agree with me?"
"In any case, dear colleagues, I myself have no doubts about that fact."
"At this decisive stage in the life of the European Union, strengthening its cultural dimension will bring about decisive responses, which only it can bring about, in a sensitive area such as the economic and social cohesion of the European Union and citizenship."
"In recent times there have been more and more signals from inside the three main European Union institutions of desires to bring culture into the centre of the European project."
"This is a great challenge which all of us must take up and try to meet."
"The European Parliament has included in the Dury-Maij-Weggen Report on the Intergovernmental Conference innovative points which the first Commission report on the cultural impact of the European Union's policies complements and clarifies."
"But I should like to pick out for its importance the recent resolution which the Irish Presidency had signed at the last 'Culture' Council held in December, which for the first time enshrines a consensus between the Member States around the new attitude to the dynamic role of culture in the European Union opening the way to strengthened inter-institutional co-operation which has been expected and hoped for for a long time."
"The Escudero report - and I should like to thank him for accepting nearly all of my proposals - clearly points in the direction in which we have to advance."
"Article 128 has to be changed so that we can have a legal basis for all actions which have a cultural dimension."
"It is urgent to put into application an integrated vision of cooperation between the Commission's departments and programmes but not to create a common cultural fund, which would mean a step backwards in terms of the new vision defended by this report."
"Above all we must have a compulsory cultural aspect in the projects of other areas funded by the Structural Funds."
"Finally, we must carry out a cultural impact study when dealing with all projects, not only in a negative sense, i.e. analysing the harm that could be done to heritage, but above all in a positive sense, in other words assessing how culture could enhance regional development, urban reconstruction, tourism and employment."
"Mr President, this has to be done sooner or later."
"And it would be better if it were done sooner."
"Mr President, even if culture is taken into consideration in directives, in the credits of the structural fund, and by the granting of direct aid, this is all rather disparate."
"Mr Escudero's excellent report quite rightly poses the basic problem, which is that of allowing the Union, while taking account of the principle of subsidiarity, to adopt additional, yet coordinated and universal, measures regarding culture, and to do so by removing the rule of unanimity which is leading to the obstruction of several programmes, a fact which is being criticised by more and more cultural organisations."
"By giving the European Union the right to implement a cultural policy which respects the national and regional diversity of Member States, while at the same time highlighting the common cultural heritage, by making decisions relating to the cultural sector subject to a qualified majority, with codecision of Parliament, culture really would become one of the basic preoccupations of Europe."
"The revision of Article 128 of the Treaty would be, to paraphrase a speech from history, a small step for modifications to texts, but a great step for the destiny of cultural creation."
"To conclude, I am sorry in this respect that the European Commissioner, who has not stayed for the whole debate, though it has not been a long one, has not stated clearly whether he is for or against the modification of Article 128, a modification which, for my part, I support entirely."
"Mr President, the fact that two speakers are not present at the end of the debate just shows the unfortunate and unsatisfactory nature of splitting a debate."
"The Commissioner replied to points and the debate continued afterwards."
"It is unfortunate and unfair."
"Perhaps the services could look at this in future."
"It is not a satisfactory way of working."
"Thank you, Mr Evans."
"Note has been taken of your complaint, but of course you will understand why - that was already explained previously - we had to proceed in precisely this way: we had to structure the debate in accordance with the particular competences of the Commissioner present."
"In any case, your remark is quite sensible and we will have to try and work at finding ways of changing things so that this kind of situation does not repeat itself."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Cost of transport"
"The next item is the report (A4-0012/97) by Mrs Schmidbauer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Commission Green Paper 'Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport - policy options for internalizing the external costs of transport in the European Union' (COM(95)0691 - C40610/95)."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we Members of this Parliament have long been waiting for a Commission initiative directed towards a juster distribution of the cost of transport."
"I should like to express my appreciation of the fact that Commissioner Kinnock, at the very beginning of his term of office, did dedicate himself to this very difficult task and produce the Green Paper on the internalization of the external costs of transport."
"That was a step in the right direction, a step towards solving the problems of transport and achieving sustainable mobility combined with due respect for the environment."
"Increasing mobility constantly adds to the problems of transport."
"In the last 20 years, the average daily mileage covered by individual members of the public has doubled, as has the number of vehicles."
"Our present system of taxes and charges, which varies greatly from one Member State to another, ignores the real costs and passes them on to non-users."
"This creates an illusion of relatively cheap transport by car, but what is happening is that each and every transport user is subsidizing the journeys made by others, and everyone - even non-owners of cars - is paying for the external costs: infrastructures, congestion, accidents and environmental pollution."
"The Green Paper is a discussion document, not a finished piece of legislation."
"I must keep stressing that point, because critics of the concept behave as if the Green Paper meant that everything was already enshrined in law."
"In principle, the Green Paper is applicable to all sectors of transport: road, rail, waterways and air."
"In practice, it concentrates on road traffic, and within road traffic it concentrates on the costs caused by heavy lorries."
"But that is not to say that the measures proposed in the Green Paper are designed to banish freight transport from the roads, as is constantly asserted by interested parties."
"I cannot find a single reference in the Green Paper that lends any weight to that assertion."
"The carriage of goods by road is and will remain an essential part of all economic activity, but it must accept an assessment based on the 'polluter pays' principle"
"Another untenable argument is that not only should the external costs be charged on but the external benefits should be credited."
"Clearly, road transport brings advantages for most people."
"But those advantages are not an external benefit, because the suppliers of transport services do not offer those services free of charge."
"The users are already paying for them."
"So this has already been taken into account when the costs are charged."
"(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski) That is why, Mr Jarzembowski, I am also against the PPE Group's Amendment No 2."
"The Green Paper does not invent any additional costs which make transport more expensive."
"It merely exposes the previously hidden costs and proposes a more efficient and fair redistribution of those costs."
"The intention is that internalization should lead to a reduction in costs, so that both businesses and the public have to spend less on transport costs, and above all: those costs must be reliably quantifiable."
"In order for the external costs to be fairly apportioned in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, principles need to be developed which will ensure that charges are linked as closely as possible to actual use."
"In other words, the charges must not be abused as an additional source of tax revenue."
"Let me recall the current controversy in Germany, about a possible increase in the petroleum tax to enable the Finance Minister to plug the financial leaks in the budget."
"That must not be allowed to happen."
"If internalization is implemented on the basis of actual use, overall transport costs will be reduced, even if charges for individual journeys are higher."
"Now I come to the various categories of external costs - first, infrastructure costs."
"The use of roads causes damage to them."
"A key factor here is the axle weight of vehicles, and the heavier the vehicle, the greater the road damage."
"Even though, in some Member States, charges are levied for road use, individual road users often do not pay for the damage which they cause; instead, as a rule, heavy goods vehicles are subsidized by private cars."
"The costs of congestion, too, are already borne in part by those involved in it, but only in part."
"On the one hand, every road user does cause every other road user to be as late as he is himself, and he pays for his decision to travel at peak times by having to spend longer doing it."
"However, this concept takes no account at all of the differing economic value of each individual journey."
"The introduction of differentiated road pricing, varying according to the region, the time and the damage caused, is intended to reduce unnecessary journeys and so improve traffic flow."
"Accident costs are nowhere near covered by the widely varying insurance systems within the Union."
"The taxpayers have to make good the shortfall, and not every taxpayer drives a motor vehicle."
"There is also the difference between safe and unsafe vehicles and/or drivers."
"In accordance with the principle whereby the responsible party pays, however, it would be logical for each driver to pay in proportion to the risks to which he gives rise."
"Even so, the method of calculation currently proposed in the Green Paper fails to convince me."
"The fact that traffic pollutes the environment is beyond dispute."
"Road transport accounts for 62 % of carbon monoxide emissions, 50 % of nitrogen oxide, 33 % of hydrocarbon and 17 % of carbon dioxide emissions."
"According to one fairly recent study, more than 20 % of the EU's population are exposed to traffic noise which is higher than the noise level that people can reasonably be expected to tolerate."
"I also note the absence in the Green Paper of any statement or study in connection with CO2 emissions."
"Some of today's environmental pollution could be cut simply by Member States doing more than they are to monitor compliance with the existing European rules and requirements."
"In order to be able to internalize the external costs, the Commission is proposing the introduction of an electronic road pricing system."
"I believe this is appropriate in principle, although rules will have to be developed to ensure data protection, and the whole thing must not be allowed to lead to social distortions."
"But it will be some time yet before a telematic road pricing system becomes practicable."
"In the meantime, as a first step, road fund taxes, petroleum taxes, licence fees and tolls should be harmonized throughout Europe, and then some or all of them can later be replaced by the road pricing system."
"Let me once again emphasize this point: the proposal in the Green Paper is not designed to make transport more expensive, simply to distribute the costs more equitably."
"There are still a few points in the Green Paper that have not been fully clarified, and indeed the Commission itself has listed them."
"It has noted which studies are still needed, because certain comments have yet to be pursued in greater breadth or depth."
"As a whole, though, the Green Paper does provide a basis for the opening-up of new avenues in transport policy."
"Those new avenues may help to solve the increasingly difficult problems of transport, and I hope that together, despite all our differences of opinion, we shall be able to bring in and continue developing this new transport policy."
"Mr President, the idea of efficient transport pricing makes this a very interesting Green Paper."
"I can only congratulate the Commission on giving thought to how transport is to continue to function in the next millennium."
"Mobility is an everyday need, and people do not always act in accordance with what politicians think should be the priorities, but take what they think is the most favourable and best option for getting where they want to go."
"Something I like in the Green Paper is the general subdivision into three essential areas: first the 'polluter pays' principle, secondly the application of market forces, and thirdly the redistribution of taxation - not a tax increase, quite the reverse, if the objectives of achieving a more cost-effective transport and mobility system are attained."
"A very brief word on the 'polluter pays' principle."
"The principle that people should pay the real costs of the miles they cover is a very good one."
"I believe that it will actually enable road users to realize what the costs are, and so behave more flexibly."
"A second essential principle is equality of treatment for all transport and mobility providers."
"As far as the market forces are concerned, it can be said that the issue is to guarantee ecologically acceptable, fair and efficient market prices, with the primary aim of reducing the cost of transport for all by improving the infrastructure and achieving those objectives that are listed in the Green Paper."
"A critical point is that when electronic pricing comes it should come to the whole of Europe, and it should allow a variety of systems - in other words, not just a single, monopolistic system that allows no competition but an arrangement that allows the best system to emerge over the course of time."
"Consequently, electronic pricing should be dependent on the damage caused to the infrastructure, it should allow time-dependent charging in sensitive, overcongested areas, and should allow differentiated petroleum taxes, depending on environmental properties, and equal fiscal treatment of all fuels and noise categories - in other words, carriers should be classified into noise categories so that relief can be given to quiet carriers."
"Safety categories should also be introduced for safe cars, together with pollutant categories, service life categories and, quite simply, scrap premiums too, so that a driver who can prove that he has scrapped a car benefits from it."
"There are possibilities, too, in the area of driving safety: falling asleep at the wheel, defective vision, slow reaction times, inadequate practical and theoretical knowledge - all these give rise to heavy costs."
"So any such instrument should also include bonus points for advanced training."
"A final point on the redistribution of taxation: all taxes should benefit the transport sector, with a view to solving its problems."
"There must be no cross-subsidization of the various types of transport."
"Regional solutions should be offered, and attempts made to guarantee the financing of research and development, telematic security systems, environmental information systems and basic and advanced training."
"Mr President, in addition to thanking you, I would also like to thank the commissioner and the Commission for the Green Paper."
"I also thank Mrs Schmidbauer for her comments."
"This is a good contribution to the debate, and it marks the first step along the way."
"The close links between the transport policy and many other areas of policy means there is a great deal to take into account."
"We must therefore tackle the matter more pragmatically, otherwise there will be the risk of losing everything."
"What we have in mind here is competition, the environment, the internal market, national cultural differences or differences in general terms, and there are many factors to bear in mind when producing a report."
"The report is therefore a compromise, but of a high quality."
"It is in fact part of the political Europe we inhabit and recognises that we have both left-wing and right-wing tendencies, and that we have special interests in the transport sector."
"The most important thing is that the debate provides a forum for the exchange of ideas the quality of which is of a high level."
"The alternative would be for the policy to stagnate, so that transport did not develop, which means transport would also stagnate."
"We are all against unfair competition in the areas of tax, energy consumption, pollution, working hours, etc. We are thinking in terms of a European vignette here."
"We are discussing the problems in the Alps."
"Let us consider these aspects first."
"But let us also agree that pollution is increasing, and it is well documented that transport's share in this pollution is also increasing."
"When in the autumn the Commission comes to deal with the problems surrounding the internalising of external costs, as they are referred to, it will be important that the Commission and the commissioner come up with a timetable for the way ahead in Europe."
"It must be more than just talk."
"In the meantime the national parliaments could be involved in the process, giving thought to the problems and taking an active part in this area."
"It would also be good if, for once, we could find a basis for co-operation rather than confrontation, so that we have a Commission able to present a product to a Council of Ministers that was able to work in the same direction."
"I support this development, and I support it in as much as it will not only mean competition between those providing transport, but also competition between forms of transport."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner and colleagues, we have a common task."
"When we come to vote tomorrow, it will not so much be legislation, as the first part of legislation."
"Mr President, like the previous speaker I must express my sincere thanks to Mrs Schmidbauer, first for presenting her report and secondly for her willingness to spend time working out sensible compromises to enable this entire House to adopt a common position on this Green Paper."
"It is very important that, on such an important question as fair or efficient pricing, there should be no trivial squabbling among the members of this House but that we should adopt a common line in dealing with the Council, and also in dealing with the Commission, Mr Kinnock."
"We Christian Democrats support the Green Paper as a first attempt to analyse the external costs which are caused by transport and should also be paid for by transport."
"But, Commissioner, I must be honest and say that I find the analysis very incomplete."
"Thus, the external costs of transport by rail, inland waterway and air are not analysed, though they are in great detail for lorries, nor are any proposals made for charging on the external costs caused by those carriers."
"To give one example, not even the effective costs incurred on the Rhine are borne by the inland waterway users."
"To that extent, you still have some homework to do."
"Parliament must insist that the same competitive conditions are introduced for all types of carrier."
"At this point in time, we must reject any unilateral scheme to make heavy goods vehicles pay the external costs, and call upon you to charge those costs on to all carriers simultaneously, so as not to create further distortions of the competition between the various carriers."
"Commissioner, the fundamentally sound idea of charging on the external costs to those who cause them must - as Mrs Schmidbauer has rightly said - not result in simply making transport more expensive and filling the coffers of the Finance Ministers."
"That cannot be what we should be doing!"
"Those funds must be used on a dedicated basis to compensate for the damage caused by transport."
"Steps must be taken in the Member States, therefore, to ensure that we do not increase the costs for lorries or other carriers, referring to general fiscal principles, and then spend the money on the fine arts in the Member States."
"That cannot be the purpose of your Green Paper or your proposals, and that is what we must ensure!"
"As a final point on long-range goods transport, this is an area where - without incurring any financial burden - we can already take effective steps to protect the environment, improve traffic safety and safeguard the competitive situation."
"Let me mention just three. We can, finally, harmonize the road tax or petroleum tax within the Union in order to ensure that contractors from different Member States compete on the same terms."
"And, when determining road tax rates, we can take into account pollution, noise and road damage, thus using the road tax classification to create incentives for reducing environmental pollution."
"Another point has already been mentioned by other members. If the Member States were to ensure - and I fear they will not do so without pressure from you, Commissioner - that driving times and rest periods are complied with and that lorries which exceed the pollution and noise thresholds are taken out of commission, if the Member States were to implement entirely practical supervisory measures, we would already be in a position to do a great deal to reduce noise, protect the environment and increase road safety, and I should be very interested to hear from you whether you will indeed adopt these practical measures."
"On the question of payment for the use of roads, I should prefer to say nothing at present, because I shall be presenting a separate report on this."
"But there are two brief comments I should like to add."
"I must tell Mrs Schmidbauer and Mr R√ºbig that I think nothing of schemes for scrapping older motor vehicles."
"All it achieves is a burden on national budgets and spectacular short-lived effects with no lasting benefit. And making manufacturers liable for the service life of engines is also plain nonsense!"
"In conclusion, Commissioner, let me ask you one more question: are you willing to do as the Committee, by a great majority, recommends and commission a comprehensive study which compiles and analyses the external costs of all transport carriers and demonstrates, so that we know exactly where we stand, that if we do take action then the external costs will be charged on to all carriers, on a reliable basis?"
"Commissioner, on 27 March last year, addressing this House on the subject of the appropriate relationship between the costs of maintaining motorways and the tolls charged for using them, you recalled the case of the Brenner Highway, where the tolls are so high, for the stretch from the Brenner to Innsbruck, as to be three times as great as the maintenance cost on which they are supposed to be based - which is a violation of the Community Treaties and of the accession agreements."
"The motive, in Austria's case, is the attempt to discourage large vehicles from using the road, especially at night, by charging a really heavy toll: over those 35 km, the charge is ECU 90 per day, and twice that from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m."
"I should make it clear that the desire to protect the integrity of the environment highly laudable, but it does not seem objectively fair that virtually the entire price of doing so has to be borne by the road-haulage contractors, just as it seems unfair that it happens only on one sector of road, at the initiative of a single State, no attempt having been made to coordinate arrangements with the neighbouring State, on whose territory the same problems exist."
"On this point, I believe the rapporteur is on dangerous ground when she proposes, in section 18, paragraph 4, that 'substantially higher' - those are her words - road charges should be authorized for corridors in which the environment is particularly badly degraded, allowing alternative solutions to be financed."
"In the present case, the issue would be to finance the tunnel under the Brenner and the entire highway from Munich to Verona which, according to a 1992 estimate, would cost MECU 13, 000, equivalent to 25, 000 billion lire."
"I cannot help wondering how much of this sum can be raised by the motorway tolls."
"So let us beware of authorizing any easy alibis for arbitrary hikes in the motorway tolls."
"This cost, too, is going to have a deadly impact on the overall make-up of transport costs and help to create worrying imbalances between different areas, between different States and even between different enterprises in the same State."
"On 5 December last year, here in Brussels, I organized a seminar entitled 'Harmonization of transport costs within the European Union' ."
"The seminar was attended by representatives of road-haulage organizations from five nations, and the first point that arose was the great desire they all felt to hold talks on this subject."
"Hence the need for a common set of rules which will take account of mileage, certainly, and of technical costs and external costs but also of the impact of the cost of labour; a report on this latter subject is to be presented in the near future."
"A trend that must be avoided is that of passing on to the transport operators all the external costs."
"And let us not forget a primary concern for the whole of Europe: the safeguarding of jobs, and more than that, the creation of new jobs, because excessive costs and new tax burdens could bring about the collapse of those small road-haulage businesses that account for 85 % of European transport."
"Mr President, we endorse the objectives of the Green Paper: a reduction of harmful effects, objective costing of all forms of transport."
"So, Commissioner, that means that the Green Paper's proposal of zero percent for inland waterways just is not possible if we want sustainable mobility."
"Are there alternatives to road transport?"
"In most cases not really."
"So we certainly do not want measures which dictate the choices which shippers have to make."
"We think that the new technologies should be encouraged."
"This needs pull-and-push measures."
"So we think that state-of-the-art technology should be rewarded rather than penalized and that the least damaging modes of transport should be charged a zero tariff."
"Certainly, and the rapporteur, whom we compliment, has made the point, we must make sure that an industry which is already structurally weak is not burdened further."
"We agree that a transition is needed from fixed to variable costs."
"To that end we support paragraphs 7, 8, 11, 12 and 15 and these together make the report acceptable as a whole."
"I have two specific questions for the Commissioner."
"A study commissioned from the firm Tebodin by the Dutch Minister of Transport and Public Works, currently president of the Council of Ministers, revealed that in freight transport more than 100 % of the costs are met."
"Does the Commissioner share that view and will he take account of this report in his further deliberations?"
"Secondly, a change from 40-tonne trucks to 44-tonners with 5 axles means a saving of 214.3 million litres and 18.4 million kg of toxic emissions."
"Will the Commissioner not bear this in mind for the sake of the environment, as Parliament recommended in our report on dimensions and weights?"
"Mr President, it is a good thing that we have the Green Paper and it is good that we have Mrs Schmidbauer's report too, because there has been an awful lot of talk about internalizing external costs in the transport sector but very little to show for it."
"I have to say that if you take a long hard look at Mrs Schmidbauer's report and compare it with the Commission's Green Paper, which has the grand title of  ºTowards fair and efficient pricing in transport: policy options for internalizing the external costs of transport in the European Union', regretfully I have to conclude that actually Mrs Schmidbauer's report is even less interesting than the Green Paper itself."
"So it seems evident that the Transport Committee has rather lost heart."
"The report concludes that internalization will not push up the cost of transport."
"But how on earth is environmentally unfriendly transport to be discouraged if it cannot be made more expensive?"
"The report says that it is not the intention to get freight transport off the roads."
"But my intention is to do precisely that, as far as possible."
"Because this freight can be carried by rail and by water in a manner far kinder to the environment."
"It was nice to hear Mr Wijsenbeek say just now that modern technology should enable the least environmentally damaging means of transport to be charged at a zero tariff."
"Mr Kinnock is right to apply a zero tariff to inland waterway transport even without modern technology."
"Because water transport is indubitably the cleanest motorized form of transport."
"Better still are other methods which as you know are not motorized, but they do not enter into it since we are talking about Europe here."
"If we really want sustainable mobility I fear the report is not tough enough on the various forms of transport and this is especially apparent from the fact that despite the rapporteur's best intentions, air transport is excluded here."
"The environment ministers concluded in December 1994 that there was no longer any reason to exempt aviation fuel from excise duty."
"The European Commission makes no mention of this in the Green Paper."
"For fear of triggering a debate which might cause problems."
"But air transport is the least friendly form of transport for the environment."
"So it is imperative to have the normal rates of duty charged on aviation fuel as speedily as possible."
"But my colleagues are all too ready to say in their own countries yes, of course we want that, but it has to be done internationally."
"And then here in the European Parliament, in the European Union, we say no, we don't want that because it is bad for competition."
"Every effort in that direction is thwarted."
"It is not so much the rapporteur but those on the right of the House who are to blame for the very mediocre quality of this report."
"Mr President, the Green Paper on the charging of external costs in transport focuses on the so-called  ºunpaid account' of transport."
"The amount and composition of this account is open to debate, but we have to get it into our heads that the movement of people and goods harms the environment and entails a cost to society."
"At present this cost is not sufficiently reflected in the price of transport."
"So I think the Green Paper is a useful starting point for further discussion based on the principle that the user pays and the polluter pays."
"In a number of respects the Green Paper fails to convince me."
"In contrast to what it claims, the costs of congestion caused by inadequate infrastructure cannot be passed on to the hauliers."
"They themselves are already the ones hardest hit."
"In order to prevent delays and make better use of our overstretched infrastructure it is better to favour economically important traffic using a system of road pricing."
"In this context I am sorry that my amendment which blames private cars for the worst of the traffic jams in urban areas was rejected."
"I am pleased to see that view expressed in the Environment Committee's report."
"I was also surprised to hear Commissioner Kinnock say in a speech that the charging of external costs was not designed to change the modal shift, and I wonder why then they are charged exclusively to road transport?"
"Does the Commissioner not believe that ultimately external costs should be charged to all transport operators?"
"And does he have any idea what that will mean for reciprocal competitiveness?"
"I am afraid that the railways will then be disadvantaged still further compared to the roads."
"I should like to hear from the Commissioner on this."
"But above all I should like to know if he favours a modal shift and what measures he has in store to that end."
"Freight transport is bound to become more expensive."
"And then I am disappointed by the Commission's position on a limited rise in fuel prices."
"Increasing duty is of course a generic measure which differentiates little according to time and place but an increase in duty can be imposed quickly and simply."
"It also sits well with the policy of greater variability and encourages economic use and the development of clean engines."
"This in contrast to raising the price of the inflexible Euro-vignette which does nothing to reduce mobility."
"In conclusion my compliments to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unlike certain other Members I have been impressed by the accuracy of the work done by the rapporteur and by the committee: it is particularly accurate as regards data, not only as regards the ECU 250 billion that represent external costs, of which congestion accounts for 120, but also as regards the accident rate, which contributes 1.5 % of the costs: more than 50, 000 people are involved in accidents, which means we are talking about ECU 166 billion."
"We should certainly give thought to another type of development, and also to ways of readjusting the transport balance in a manner that is compatible with the environment, placing great emphasis on sustainable mobility."
"From this point of view, a substantial impact has been produced by market forces, which have increased flexibility, and the disincentive to use public transport, which factors, in some ways, have represented a negative model."
"Let me give you a few figures on CO2 ."
"If we consider the problem of transporting 2000 tonnes over 1000 kilometres, CO2 emissions amount to 7 tonnes for transport by sea, 11 tonnes by rail and 60 tonnes by road."
"These are matters which cause us serious concern, as of course does the change in the modal split over recent years, which has been seriously against rail transport."
"We need only recall that in 1970 transport by road accounted for 48.6 %, whereas today it accounts for 71.7 %; in 1970 31.7 % of shipments were carried by rail, whereas the figure today, unhappily, is a mere 14.9 %; in the same period, transport by inland waterway has declined from 12.3 % to 7.7 %."
"As can be seen, the intermodal aspects are important."
"The accurate calculation of external costs should also help in encouraging a change in the modal split."
"From this point of view, Commissioner, I believe much more practical steps need to be taken: I believe it is important to take swift legislative action - in other words, not to dwell on the investigatory phase - and to take action regarding sensitive routes;"
"I am particularly convinced by the argument in favour of Europe-wide harmonization of the factors currently guiding transport policy, as regards the road tax, the excise duty on petroleum, and the registration tax and associated tolls."
"These, it seems to me, are specific areas on which we need to work in order to give effective force to this scheme of yours, which is timely and which also looks to a different culture of transport."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposals towards a fair and efficient pricing as a means of establishing fairer competition between transport modes."
"I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and his staff for the document and also our rapporteur on the excellent work she has done."
"Our purpose in this exercise is to price external costs of transport use."
"It is asserted that transport users - principally road users - do not pay the costs imposed on them by their travel decisions and that this leads to a mismatch between the price paid by users and underlying costs to society as a whole."
"It is a laudable objective."
"If we link transport policy as directly as possible to the costs incurred for making a journey this would be good for the environment and give a fairer, more efficient use of transport."
"So far, so good."
"However, the external costs have to be evaluated - pollution, noise, congestion and others. My first question to the Commissioner this evening is: How do we establish what these costs are?"
"How can the Commission evaluate them?"
"How do you then pass them on to individual users?"
"What would the role of technology be and how would the Commission envisage the use of telematics, satellites and other modern technology?"
"We need proper data and empirical evidence on these costings."
"My message to the Commission this evening is that the paper is very short on such empirical evidence and data."
"It will come as no surprise to the Commissioner that the UK is already putting increasing emphasis on the need for pricing structures in transport to reflect full costs including environmental costs."
"How certain can we be about the environmental external factors and how to cost them and then transfer this into pricing measures?"
"Both the Commission Green Paper and the rapporteur's report put great emphasis on fiscal measures."
"My point to both the Commissioner and rapporteur is very clear and positive."
"We must not disregard the principle of subsidiarity."
"Can the Commissioner here tonight prove an overriding case for action at Community level?"
"Otherwise I would argue that tax measures are best left for Member States to decide."
"One thing we can all agree on is that this is a complex issue which requires further study and debate."
"One final thought for the Commissioner and the rapporteur: public transport could and should be a major beneficiary from fair and efficient pricing in transport."
"Yet public transport today only accounts for between 10 and 15 % of the total mobility market."
"I should like to request the Commissioner to pledge the support of other Commissioners and himself to fund research and development programmes, in particular through the fourth and fifth framework programmes, for public transport as part of a general transport policy."
"I also hope that we can ask the Commission to support R & D for telematics through the fourth and fifth framework programmes."
"I look forward to the Commissioner's replies and to thoughts from the rapporteur on these points."
"Regardless of these provisos, I commend both the Commission document and the rapporteur's text to the House."
"Mr President, I thought we were here to debate Mrs Schmidbauer's report."
"The many questions Anne McIntosh has just put to the Commission relate to quite a different theme, and I do not feel the Commission should respond to them this evening."
"They have nothing to do with Mrs Schmidbauer's report."
"Mr Sindal, that is not a point of order."
"Please forgive me but I cannot hold up the debate."
"Mr. President, first let me thank Mrs. Schmidbauer for the excellent work that she has put into this report."
"As I see it, it is important that we, here in Parliament, try to find ways to promote the internal market."
"My vision of the internal market is that all countries, irrespective of the distance between them and the centre of Europe, should be able to compete on equal terms."
"The transport sector is one of the most important sectors in this respect."
"It is also one of the most appropriate sectors on which to apply our vision of the free internal market."
"There are many examples of how we can make progress in this area."
"The Transeuropean Networks are an excellent current example, when they are finally completed, distances will become shorter and transport more effective as a result."
"As a Swede, I see the long distances between Sweden and the large continental markets as a great disadvantage to competition."
"Essentially, every time we sell something abroad, we have an export disadvantage of approximately 70-100 miles."
"This does not only apply to Sweden of course, but also to countries such as Finland, Greece, Spain and Portugal."
"It affects all 'peripheral' countries or, in other words, all those countries with long distances between them and Europe's large markets."
"It is therefore important that we take this into account when we talk about loading external costs on to transport."
"I am not highlighting this aspect in order to be negative to the proposed motion."
"On the contrary, there are a lot of positive factors in the report."
"But the factors which I have pointed out must also be included in any future action for this sector."
"The same applies to the discussions on tax harmonisation."
"I do not think that we should be aiming for an 'all European' tax system but a balanced harmonisation of tax in European countries for this sector is perhaps necessary to create equal conditions for competition."
"With this in mind, I think that if we take environmental effects into account in the tax rate we will be moving in the right direction."
"Europe has serious environmental problems and of course the transport sector contributes a great deal to them."
"We must tackle these problems somehow, but not in a way which threatens the fundamental principles of the internal market."
"Mrs. Schmidbauer's report on the internalisation of external transport costs in the European Union is largely a good report."
"The proposal contains the desire to progress towards harmonisation, and the proposed harmonisation is well thought out in view of the problems which can arise."
"But, I would have liked to have seen some mention of the problem of distance which I have mentioned."
"We ought at least to keep it in mind when the proposal is implemented."
"We are not proposing these measures purely from an environmental point of view but also in order to strengthen the internal market and protect free competition within the European Union."
"Let me conclude by asking Commissioner Kinnock the following question: Is the Commission prepared to consider the problem of distance in its future work in this field?"
"Mr President, I wish to exercise my right under the Rules to make a personal statement."
"I apologise to Commissioner Kinnock that Mr Sindal has been in a particularly petulant mood this evening."
"Perhaps if I had spoken in Danish he would have followed the thrust of my comments."
"I am perfectly entitled to put questions to the Commissioner and he is perfectly entitled to reply."
"Mrs McIntosh, you will be fully entitled to make your statement after the Commissioner has spoken."
"Mr President, I hate to intervene on what is obviously a domestic quarrel but I am certain that Mr Sindal was not in the slightest petulant."
"This is a characteristic which would be entirely unfamiliar to him."
"In the free exchange of opinions in this democratic House, I am certain that everyone understands the relevance of his intervention and indeed the validity of Miss McIntosh's response."
"It just demonstrates how far I have distanced myself from real politics these days."
"As the House will know, in the year since I presented the Commission Green Paper on fair and efficient pricing in transport, the debate has been lively, as we have witnessed again tonight, and the consultation has been wide."
"I have had the opportunity to discuss the issue in all its forms and implications with a very broad range of people and organizations including those who attended our conference on the subject in this city last November."
"The quality of the sustained interest highlights the importance of the issue and the draft resolution in this House on the Green Paper adds to that."
"I would, therefore like to compliment Mrs Schmidbauer for the thorough approach she has taken and for the results she has produced on what is obviously a very complex subject."
"In particular, I welcome the conviction which she clearly expressed again tonight on two central matters."
"First, that pricing should form an integral part of comprehensive transport policies in all modes of transport."
"I would point out to Mr Jarzembowski, amongst others, as I am sure he understands, that the extent of the reference to road transport in the Green Paper is entirely the result of the fact that it produces 90 % of the external costs of transport."
"But on closer examination of the Green Paper everyone will observe very clearly that extensive reference is made to all modes."
"Not only is reference made in passive form but there are specific proposals now being implemented for further examinations and studies relating to the variety of modes of transport."
"This is something which Mrs Schmidbauer and many other colleagues clearly and rightly recognize."
"Secondly, the view expressed in this House is clear on another matter."
"The objectives of applying charges in line with costs is to ensure equal conditions of competition, as Miss McIntosh pointed out, to increase users' awareness and thereby to contribute to increased overall efficiency and sustainability of the European transport system."
"Having gone through this initial exercise of identifying the hidden costs which transport activities generate, we must now move on to the development of conceptual thinking and to the practical task of compiling proposals for workable and productive Community policies and, where appropriate, legislation."
"I would point out to one or two contributors to the debate tonight that Community action is appropriate, simply because we have a Community, because we have a single market, because transport in all of its modes is interrelated and integrated and in the name of equity, fair competitive conditions and the need universally to safeguard the environment, there is a very strong case for Community activity, based entirely on the willingness of democratically elected governments of the Member States to endorse or to modify proposals that come from the Commission and from this House."
"The first tangible move in the direction of the development of workable policies, as the House already knows, comes in the Commission proposal for revision of the directive on road charges for heavy goods vehicles."
"Judging from the discussions and conclusions on the Green Paper, I hope I am right in thinking that the House will once again give its valued support for that initiative."
"I would, however, like to comment on the suggestion in the report before the House that when harmonizing rates of vehicle taxes, account should be taken of the materials from which a vehicle is made."
"Although I can see the clear rationale for that idea I should, nevertheless, stress, that this and equally valid ideas can be treated more effectively in the context of other Community policies, in this case those relating to industrial materials and processes."
"A similar view led us to limit the discussion on abatement of carbon dioxide emissions in the Green Paper since that has been, and still is considered to be, a cross-sectoral issue."
"As the House may know, the Commission is currently finalizing a proposal on updating the Community's minimum excise duty on energy products in which we will ensure that CO2 emission limitation is deal with in all its relevant sectors, including transport."
"I should now like briefly to go through a few points where I feel some further clarification or information on the Commission's views or activities could add to the understanding between us in our different institutions and enhance the constructive cooperation between us."
"What comes to mind first is our common position concerning the need to secure the development of a well-balanced transport system where all transport modes realize their full potential."
"While we are in the process of working to establish such a balance, however, it is clear that even as we respect the principle that all modes should pay their real costs, some modes need to be particularly fostered in one way or another."
"In this context, I should like to mention for instance our proposal to extend the pilot actions for combined transport - the PACT programme - for five years with an increased budget and broader scope."
"In addition, the Commission's White Paper on a rail strategy which seeks to promote access to rail freight markets is expect to improve the attractiveness of this mode and to complement our pricing policy."
"Finally, as a follow-up to last November's conference and in response to a proposal put forward by industry representatives, I will be launching a tripartite initiative on best environmental practice and I will be inviting industry, transport operators and environmental organizations to participate."
"There will of course be invitations to Members of this House."
"I believe that will further advance the idea of differentiated environmental charges and result in the implementation of practical measures."
"I will also be launching a workshop on best practice in local solutions to urban transport problems where research on telematics, the citizens' network and fair and efficient pricing will be discussed together as they should be."
"In the Commission we will continue our work on the various issues raised in the Green Paper through specific studies and research as some in the debate have asked for tonight and we will be including in our considerations the crucial matter of interoperability of road pricing systems."
"We will be developing work obviously through measures to improve transport infrastructure and through legislation for both regulatory and fiscal instruments."
"The most practical way to achieve the best, overall results is to mobilize all forces to act on the variety of aspects of the complex problem of improving our transport system in an environmentally compatible way."
"I consider this House to be one of the most persuasive forces in this debate and that is just one of the reasons for me to welcome the favourable opinion on our Green Paper on fair and efficient pricing and to commend Mrs Schmidbauer's excellent report to this House."
"I would conclude by expressing my regret that because of time constraints, I cannot respond at this juncture to the variety of questions."
"Doubtlessly we shall return to this issue in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I look forward to that event very eagerly."
"Thank you, Mr Kinnock for the explanations you have given us and for your sense of humour which, at this time of night, is very welcome."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Research and sustainable development"
"The next item is the report (A4-0382/96) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Community policy for research and sustainable development."
"The rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, has asked to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, in line with Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, and together with the Confederal Group of the European Unitarian Left - Nordic Green Left, I propose what in effect was decided in the Committee on Investigation, Technological Development and Energy last week, on 21 January, because it recognized the value of debating this report again in more depth, giving all the groups time to introduce amendments and contribute to improving the report."
"So I ask that the report be referred back to committee."
"Mr Marset Campos, your request has been made on behalf of a political group and is perfectly in keeping with Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure."
"We shall now go into the usual procedure: a Member of the European Parliament will call for a fresh referral to committee and another Member will speak against, and then we shall have a vote on this basic question."
"Mr President, I wish to support the request by Mr Marset Campos for a referral back to the Research and Energy Committee."
"It is very important that we get this right; it is a preliminary to our discussions on the Fifth Research Framework Programme and it will inform our discussions on that programme."
"It is essential, therefore, in view of the new documents coming from the Commission that we have this back in committee in order to adjust it as may be necessary to meet the needs of our forthcoming discussions on the Fifth Framework Programme."
"So we would like to support the reference back to committee."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you not to refer this report back to committee."
"We have had a hearing."
"We have had lengthy discussions in the Research and Energy Committee, and we reached agreement in committee."
"The PSE and the PPE tabled amendments, and we dealt with those amendments at length, wanting this important report on sustainable development, with our proposed amendments, to have the chance to be adopted as soon as possible."
"So I ask that this report should be dealt with today, as intended."
"(Parliament voted to refer the report back to Committee)"
"Development of statistics on R and D"
"The next item is the report (A4-0383/96) by Mr Izquierdo Collado, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on an interim Commission report according to Article 8 of the Council Decision (94/78/CE, Euratom) establishing a multiannual programme for the development of Community statistics on research, development and innovation (COM(96)0042 - C4-0247/96)."
"Mr President, I want to begin my speech by announcing the clear and decided support of the Committee on Research for this multiannual programme presented to us by the Commission."
"So we are not dealing with completed work, but with an intermediate stage."
"Our analysis of the Commission's work is positive."
"We think the procedures and deadlines are being adequately kept to and we hope everything can be finally concluded to produce a new situation in scientific statistics in Europe."
"We therefore await the culmination of the work and we encourage the Commission to continue with the effort logically required by any attempt to transform habits which are still very deep-rooted in the various countries, and to establish a clear Community standard."
"But no-one should interpret our attitude as uncritical."
"We think a great deal remains to be done, perhaps the most difficult part, the part that will dignify the quality of the Commission's work."
"But primarily we consider that we are on the right road and that this should culminate in the presentation of the Commission's final report."
"Assuming we can maintain the same criterion then that we are applying now, it will mean that substantial progress has been made in a really important area for the European Union."
"Mr President, we are talking about scientific statistics in a Europe which is a giant in basic research, but not in technology and innovation."
"The reasons for this gap are being analysed."
"How is it possible for Europe to have the capacity for investment in basic research at this exceptional level, and lack that capacity when it comes to market applications, technological development, the innovation which, logically, provides the market basic research needs to become profitable?"
"Of course, there are many causes."
"But it seems to me that having inadequate statistics is likely to be one of the reasons why European research is not as successful as it ought to be."
"We need to move towards this European statistical system for research, technological development and innovation, because without such statistics we will not have all the data necessary for producing a definition of research and development, which is vital for the Union."
"And we want to involve the citizens in it, gathering their opinions and avoiding 'enlightened despotism' , aware that they can make a major contribution."
"Mr President, we need a legal basis for carrying out scientific surveys, and this is proposed in the report."
"The current situation is unsatisfactory."
"The States collaborate voluntarily as best they can because they want to, in some cases, but without the ingredient of compulsion that is needed for all the States to unify and harmonize their statistics and the legal basis the European Union needs to demand collaboration and not just urge collaboration."
"We believe the databases must include qualitative ingredients, as well as quantitative ones, because they are fundamental to clear statistical diagnosis."
"We consider these European databases, this European 'bibliometry' , essential now unless we want to end up running a branch office of the United States and have no identity of our own."
"We are calling for the statistics to be regionally based."
"The scientific infrastructure must be put on a regional basis and our regional surveys should provide basic indicators for carrying out regional policy."
"And finally, Mr President, the new information society should cover all the components of collection and presentation of scientific statistics, because we certainly cannot stand outside this new model of society which is going to be designed, at the scientific level, by the information society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just how important statistics are is something of which we shall have evidence enough once again this year."
"The debate about participation in monetary union is almost exclusively concerned with the satisfying of the indebtedness criteria, and in principle that is simply a matter of data which were obtained by means of statistical techniques."
"This example also shows, incidentally, how difficult it often is to obtain comparable data."
"But our debate today is not concerned with economics - it is concerned with the interim Commission report on research and innovation."
"It is a common European problem that we are faced with bringing together fifteen different systems in ten different languages."
"As a result, we often have to find different solutions from, for example, the USA or Japan - our biggest competitors in research and development."
"To enable us to optimize the results of the common research policy, we need to create the optimum conditions, and this is where the Community statistics come into play."
"It is absolutely essential to have up-to-date data from all Member States, acquired on the same basis, when planning research programmes."
"In addition, the decision-takers in science, research, economics and politics must have access to the data they need for their decisions, in comprehensible form."
"This is why I welcome the Commission's action plan, with its proposals to close loopholes, eliminate differences in methodology and make the contents of databases accessible to the public."
"It is also important to avoid duplication of effort, so as to prevent data from being obtained from different levels."
"Subsidiarity is a major issue in statistics: we should prefer to cause as little inconvenience as possible to those questions, and at the same time to make the data as user-friendly as possible."
"I can only support the report by my colleague Juan Izquierdo: this rather dry subject is not going to get him any newspaper headlines, but he has done his job conscientiously even so, and I thank him for it."
"The time available to me is too short for detailed consideration of all the relevant points Juan has made."
"So I shall confine myself to one point - the point which, in my view, is lacking."
"It is essential that we should make a start now on making our knowledge regarding the production of statistics available to the States of central and eastern Europe."
"For a start, this will guarantee that we get reliable data on those States' capacities, and we shall also be helping them to become competitive."
"I know, too, how difficult it has been in the former GDR, since reunification, to obtain reliable data, even if only on such matters as chocolate consumption or the stock of X-ray equipment."
"This has been an unacceptable and even intolerable situation as far as industry and innovation are concerned, and we must ensure that nothing of the kind happens again."
"So I should like to take this opportunity of pointing out the importance of involving the associated States in the action plan."
"Mr President, may I first express my pleasure at the presence here of Commissioner Kinnock and his sharing our interest in statistics."
"May I extend my compliments to Mr. Izquierdo Collado on his report in dealing with a subject which is not exactly electrifying."
"His report has done it more than full justice."
"I cannot resist reference to that old politicians' adage about lies, damn lies and statistics; indeed I am reminded of the story that statistics are the things that gentlemen use rather as a drunk does a lamp post, i.e. more for support than for illumination."
"The important point here is the need for dissemination of results of research in the European Union and without statistics it is very difficult to disseminate results."
"We must share the results of research as widely as possible in order to stimulate and encourage more research."
"We must note the importance of networks in research and a high level of participation of different partners in the research of the fourth framework."
"Again, without a record of the work that has been undertaken, it is extremely difficult to encourage new participants."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado in his report makes reference to the debate between applied research and basic research."
"May I confess my preference for applied research because we need research which is closer to the customer, closer to the market-place."
"May I just give some credit to the contribution that the United Kingdom makes as I believe a partner in the largest number of research projects in the European Union."
"This is a vital contribution, a positive contribution that we make."
"In this day and age it is quite nice to record that the UK does make a positive contribution."
"May I close on a constituency note in commending the participants from the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth and the small and medium-size enterprises in my constituency in Devon for their participation in the research work of the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's report on the establishment of a multiannual programme for the development of Community statistics on research, development and innovation provides a useful opportunity to argue in favour of harmonizing the structures of statistical databases in the European Union."
"The creation of a European system of research statistics is an invaluable tool for evaluating and measuring the progress of the research programmes, and thus for providing a more solid basis for the guidelines and investment decisions of Community research policy."
"I am in agreement with this initiative by the Commission, and I am in agreement with the rapporteur on the need also to take public opinion into account."
"If there is one thing about this initiative that concerns and puzzles me, it is this: will the statistics programme simply be applied by the Commission to Community research which, taking everything in context, is already well coordinated?"
"It will also be adopted by a number of leading organizations in the European field, but I do wonder, with a degree of scepticism, whether the introduction of these new statistical methods in the context of the activity, research and development programmes of the Member States, will in itself be sufficient to bring order, to cast light on a mass of activities, sometimes coordinated by ministers and sundry bodies - I refer here to the Italian situation, with which I am rather more familiar - which often do not even succeed in avoiding duplication of programmes, not to mention research programmes in industry which have little desire to provide a record of their activities for outsiders."
"Finally, we must not forget that the research undertaken by the Member States is precisely what constitutes the greater part of Europe's research investment."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's initiative and I hope, even though I have my doubts, that it will rapidly bring concrete results."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the welcome extended to me in this debate by Mr Chichester."
"Perhaps he did not suspect my fascinated interest in matters statistical but I know it is one that I share with a very large number of people associated with this Parliament, which is why they are clearly flocking into this debate tonight."
"The House will be well aware that the formulation, monitoring and evaluation of a policy on research, development and innovation all obviously necessitate high-quality and harmonized statistical information."
"It is equally clear that it is only possible to introduce such an information system with common standards and with synchronization of data collection and data dissemination exercises."
"When in 1994 the Council adopted its decision to establish a multi-annual programme for achieving these objectives, it therefore asked for an interim report."
"The report produced last year provides an inventory of the situation and also indicated that the work mentioned in Article 4 of the decision is well advanced."
"The Commission is pleased that the report has been welcomed by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and thanks the rapporteur, Mr. Izquierdo Collado, for his very detailed study of the Commission's text and for the interest that he and his colleagues have shown in these proposals."
"As the report before the House sensibly notes, organizational changes and the growing importance of the knowledge industry make adaptations to the traditional statistical framework necessary."
"Conceptional studies are now being carried out in order to determine the changes to be made in our statistical systems and to propose new indicators."
"A second Community survey on innovation will consequently be launched this year in the Member States which should encompass some of these aspects."
"The search for a detailed breakdown of the data by sector, by geographical level and by type of research, for example, is also an ongoing activity of the Commission services."
"Whilst recognising the need for comprehensive information, it is generally felt that we should not demand too much from replies provided by those taking part in the statistical surveys."
"Meanwhile, the proposed extension of harmonization in cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean basin will be closely examined by the Commission."
"The Commission has already expanded the existing range of science and technology indicators by extending the geographical cover, by mobilizing information sources such as patent and bibliometric databases and by incorporating statistics on public awareness of science and technology."
"We will continue in this direction, with the work already under way, on compiling information on human resources, science and technology and on the mobility of scientists and students."
"In order to achieve these objectives more effectively, the Commission plans to promote the role of statistics in the Fifth Framework Research and Development Programme and to include it in statistical initiatives."
"The establishment of a legal framework for the regular collection of information on R & D and innovation is, as the House may know, being examined."
"I have to inform the House, however, that some Member States have expressed strong reservations about this suggestion."
"In their view, the current budgetary constraints and the need to avoid over-burdening firms taking part in statistical surveys reduce the attractiveness of such an initiative."
"However, there are other Member States which consider that a legal framework would be desirable to ensure the provision of high-quality statistics at European level."
"Account will, obviously, have to be taken of these diverse views and of any changes made during the InterGovernmental Conference to the Treaty article that relates to statistics."
"The Commission is grateful to this Parliament for its support for the development of a system of harmonized statistical information on science and technology."
"Such a system plainly provides an instrument for public monitoring and therefore for effective policy formulation and conduct."
"Parliament's role in the evolution of that system is valued and the Commission thanks those who have been directly involved like tonight's rapporteur."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Application of Community law"
"The next item is the report (A4-0001/97) by Mrs Schaffner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Commission's Thirteenth Annual Report to Parliament on monitoring the application of Community law - 1995 - (COM(96)0600 - C4-0363/96)."
"Mr President, this thirteenth annual report on the application of Community law which the Commission is proposing to us fulfils, in accordance with a now well-established attitude, two essential functions. On the one hand, to establish the state of transposition of directives by the Member States, and on the other to give an account of the use which the Commission has made of its discretionary power to initiate infringement proceedings against States."
"But beyond this record made in the thirteenth report, in a very analytical way, we have a chance to reflect in depth upon the ways of getting to know better the day to day reality of Community law in the Member States and, from this thirteenth report, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has drawn three principal approaches."
"Firstly, as the Committee on Legal Affairs has shown many times over and for all institutions of the Union, what is true for some must also be true for others."
"In the domain of the implementation of Community law, the Commission needs to demonstrate greater transparency when it uses its discretionary power to initiate infringement proceedings, in particular in the pre-litigation stage provided for by Article 169 of the Treaty."
"Rather than knowing how many times it has acted, it would be interesting to know why it acted and even more, why it did not act."
"In deciding, by means of a press release, to make known the criteria of application of Article 171 of the Treaty, and to define the method it uses to calculate financial penalties imposed upon States, the Commission is moving in the direction of greater transparency."
"There is just one matter for regret: that none of this information was addressed to Parliament."
"Next, it is obvious that it is necessary to maintain, as much at the level of the Commission as at that of its colegislators, the will to draw up clear, concise directives and to allow for the principle of subsidiarity."
"These conditions are imperative if directives are to be transposed into national law as effectively as possible."
"For even if 90 % of applicable directives are transposed, with a very good rate among the last three States to join the Union, it should be noted that it is in crucial areas such as agriculture, transport and the environment that the greatest number of problems can be observed."
"Beyond the responsibility of the States, and because of the diversity and sometimes the complexity of the internal organisation of the various States, it seems that it would be of interest to establish a permanent dialogue at various levels, between the Commission and national legislators, in order to create a true legal Community."
"This might even encourage them to ask for technical assistence, as needed, in order that the essential aim, that of the correct application of Community law, be achieved."
"If cooperation with national authorities concerning information is important at this stage, the role of citizens and national courts in the application of Community law should not be ignored."
"They are the ones who demand, on the one hand, and who judge on the other, the right to reparation in cases of faulty application, and even of nontransposition of directives."
"This depends in the first instance upon national law, regarding the conditions of form and content."
"It is particularly important, therefore, that the parliaments of Member States, which are the origin of national law, should be conscious of the fact that they have a role to play in this very specific area of the right to reparation."
"The fact that the condition of content may vary from one Member State to another lies in contradiction with the basic requirement for homogeneous and uniform application of citizens' rights."
"An effective application, a uniform application of Community law therefore requires at last that there is an increase in the amount of information conveyed both to specialised audiences and to those who practice the law."
"The Grotius and Schuman programmes are concerned with all citizens thanks to the Citizens of Europe programme."
"By responding to this expectation, which has already been formulated by our Assembly, the Council and the Commission must be saluted for these initiatives."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs just hopes strongly that sufficient financial support will be made available for these activities."
"In the same way, in the domain of information, it hopes for several things: that thanks to the financial participation of the Community, national courts might be given access to the Celex system in a user-friendly format; that law students in the Union might have a sufficient knowledge of Community law, even if they are not aiming for the legal or judicial professions, for example administrative, careers, journalism, etc.; that professionals in legal and judicial disciplines might receive, themselves, tuition and training in Community law, before embarking on their professions."
"These proposals are in the interest of all, in the interest of Member States, in the interest of the Union and in the interest of citizens."
"A transparent system of Community law which is simple, well-known, and which meets the expectations of citizens would thus be the best means of eradicating the current feeling of doubt affecting public opinion with respect to the construction of Europe."
"The role of us, the Parliament, as the representative of all the citizens of the Union, is to be conscious of this lack of enthusiasm, but our role as an institution is to act in such a way as to reverse this drift."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen who are still here - because the audience at this late hour is fairly sparse, but of high quality - I would first like to congratulate Mrs Schaffner on her report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"The concerns set out in the explanatory statement coincide, in general, with those of the Committee on Petitions."
"What separates the two committees is that our working system is based on direct contact with hundreds of citizens and groups, and that obliges us to sharpen some of our criticism of the Commission."
"The demoralization of the citizens, and indeed their defencelessness against the slow progress of the procedures, does nothing either for European construction or the extension of the sense of citizenship which ought to accompany the magnificent adventure of sharing such a wide, rich and plural common area."
"The Committee on Petitions is a key structure in the institutional framework."
"The petitions presented have made it possible to detect numerous failures in the transposition and application of Community law."
"Cooperation with the European Commission has been excellent and will continue to be so."
"But we are surprised that her report should be so critical and mysterious about the total number of violations the parliamentary institution has detected."
"Secondly, we reiterate - with little hope, because we have been insisting on this for seven years - the need to accelerate the procedure under article 169."
"And we must also insist on the unhesitating use of article 171 because it is scandalous how many decisions are ignored by those - the governments, of course -who participate in drawing up the legislation."
"On the 'package meetings' , we do think they are a good idea, but we reject their use for under-cover transactions or pacts for extended periods to transpose correctly what has been done badly or inadequately in the periods provided."
"The Commission is the guardian of the treaty, but the governments are responsible for applying the law and monitoring its strict fulfilment."
"The principle of equality must always be present, and so must transparency, the essential element for the credibility of the system."
"The Commission's efforts on transparency are very positive and we applaud them, because we must always remember that the citizens are fundamental to the construction of Europe, and only the sceptics and anti-Europeans favour opacity."
"To sum up, Mr President, we call for strict application of article 169, and no hesitation in applying article 171, and we urge the Commission to be more transparent in presenting its annual report."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party I, too, would like to commend Mrs Schaffner for the difficult work that she has undertaken on this very important subject. I am sorry that the debate is taking place at this hour of the day in clear disregard of the subject's importance."
"This year again, Mr President, we are forced, on the basis of the report by Mrs Schaffner on the Commission's report on monitoring the application of Community law, to repeat several of the observations that we have had to make year after year."
"The need to do so is a cause of sorrow to me, but I am consoled by one thing at least: by continuing to draw attention to the shortcomings and the problems we do ensure that some of them are eventually tackled; very late in the day perhaps, and perhaps inadequately - but it is something."
"Let me say it again: another year has gone by and the citizens of the European Union still find Community law exceptionally complex and difficult to comprehend."
"The Commission needs to gather together the manpower that will enable it to make much faster progress in that direction."
"Everyone should understand that codification will at the same time facilitate better application of the Community's rules and make Community law more accessible and more comprehensible to Europe's citizens."
"The proper working of the internal market depends to a large extent on the degree to which its rules are as familiar and comprehensible and applied in the same manner as the rules of national law."
"As far as the transposition of Community law into national law is concerned, the situation in most sectors does appear, after a great deal of effort, to have improved, as Mrs Schaffner herself has said. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain, particularly in the transport, environment and energy sectors and in the agriculture sector as regards implementation of the White Paper."
"It is important, therefore, that directives adopted should be clear, concise and consistent with the subsidiarity principle so as to avoid problems of all kinds when they are transposed."
"Like the two previous speakers, I wish to stress the importance of using the procedures of Articles 169 and 171 and of imposing penalties as a means to achieving better results."
"Having said all that, Mr President, there are also several encouraging things that deserve mention."
"I think, firstly, of the Karolus and Mathaeus programmes dealing with exchanges of national civil servants and, more generally, I believe, with cooperation and exchange of information between the Commission and the national authorities, both at the pre-legislative stage and at the stage when Community acts are implemented."
"There is also the Grotius programme. I hope that this Commission initiative does indeed lead to a Council decision on a joint action on a programme of incentives and exchanges for practitioners in the justice area."
"However, we should remember also to point out once more to the Member States that it is absolutely essential that they ensure that lawyers acquire a knowledge of Community law during their university studies."
"I should also mention the Commission's initiative in putting forward the Robert Schuman action."
"The proposed action has been designed to provide temporary financial support for initiatives by institutions in the Member States responsible for the training of judges and lawyers or for supplying them with information and, as such, will be very helpful."
"It offers an additional means of assisting the 100, 000 judges and 450, 000 lawyers of the Union to perform their role more effectively."
"Another thing that deserves full mention is the 'Citizens of Europe - Citizens First' initiative launched jointly by the Commission and Parliament in November 1996 for the purpose of making citizens aware of their rights."
"This answers a call that I myself made in my capacity as the rapporteur of last year's report by the Legal Affairs Committee on the Commission report on monitoring the application of Community law."
"As a Community based on the rule of law, the European Community law must never become neglectful of the quality of the application of the rules that it adopts."
"It must always seek to ensure that its rules are given correct and effective application."
"Mr President, allow me to say in concluding that I believe that the points highlighted in Mrs Schaffner's report and her observations and demands are a useful addition to the huge endeavour that Parliament has been making in concert with the Commission over the years and will take us a step further down the road of improvement."
"There have been some elements of progress this year. I have mentioned them in order that we should not appear always to be carping, always to be grumblers."
"Some things have been done. Now we need to press on and do more, even more quickly, even more effectively, so as to achieve the target that has been set."
"I too welcome Mrs Schaffner's report and I am glad to see Mr Kinnock here with us."
"Because what I have to say concerns him directly, I think."
"We have just received the annual report for 1992/1993 and for the past six months we have been told that we will be getting the 1993/1994 report any time now."
"We now find that for all these years figures simply are not available for a number of Member States; the Commission just does not chase them up but says yes, we don't have the figures, they do not provide them."
"This is what this report is about."
"Whilst there are Member States which quite simply flout Community legislation, at the same time summum ius can mean summa iniuria , extreme law can create extreme injustice."
"It means a new inequality for our citizens which the Commission must not tolerate."
"A second point."
"Article 177, the obtaining of a preliminary ruling."
"Together with another honourable member who recently moved from the EPP to Mrs Schaffner's Group I instituted proceedings before the Court in Rotterdam, where the chief public prosecutor there said: sorry, Sir, you know that a preliminary ruling can only be requested by the highest judicial body in the land."
"A flagrant error in the application of Community law."
"It also shows that in all Member States of the Community one can become a judge or public prosecutor without knowing anything at all about Community law."
"I and others have been pressing for five years at least for European law to be made a compulsory part of the syllabus at all Europe's law faculties."
"We would like to see that done at last."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must begin by thanking the rapporteur for providing us with so many practical suggestions on study and exchange programmes, training in Community law, as has just been emphasized, breach-of-contract proceedings and many other aspects."
"I believe these are all practical and reasonable suggestions which this House should support, and no doubt will support."
"One aspect I regard as particularly important is the 'Citizens of Europe' initiative mentioned in Section 16 of the report, a guide to citizens' rights and duties with regard to the application of Community law."
"This seems particularly important to me when I read this passage of the report in the light of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions."
"There is another point, however, which strikes me."
"Citizens' rights are considered here with reference to possible malfunctions of the single market - a clear reference to the lack of substance of Union citizenship."
"But, of course, I find it even more remarkable that while we talk about Union citizenship we also talk about Community law."
"Are the Union's citizens really just Community citizens, or will we eventually succeed in shaping Community law into Union law and, perhaps, rescuing something from the approach of the witching hour and bringing it out into the light of day - the everyday light of the European Union?"
"Mr President, I shall begin by thanking Mrs Schaffner for the excellent report she has made on the Commission's thirteenth annual report on monitoring the application of Community law."
"The thoroughness of the analysis, the quality of the criticism and the relevance of the suggestions she has made are worthy of particular commendation."
"As the House will know, the annual report on the monitoring of Community law which was first produced in 1983 at Parliament's request, relates to the first of the tasks assigned to the Commission by Article 155 of the Community Treaty which is to ensure, and I quote the Treaty: ' that the provisions of this Treaty and the measures taken by the institution pursuant thereto are applied' ."
"The Commission's report is very much the result of a productive exchange between Parliament and the Commission."
"As Members will know very well, when preparing a new report the Commission naturally refers carefully to Parliament's resolutions and recommendations on the previous year's report and as we have heard during the course of tonight's debate from Mr. Anastassopoulos, there is always room for further improvement."
"This instrument already owes a great deal to Parliament's careful scrutiny."
"The first objective of the Annual Report is for the Commission to give an account of its own action and the Thirteenth Report noted an improvement in the handling of infringement proceedings, with a start being made on reducing the time that they take."
"This trend continued in 1996, when the Commission gave strong emphasis to speeding up consideration of infringements and to rationalizing its internal procedures."
"In July last year, a number of measures were adopted which are already having some beneficial effect."
"For instance, it was decided that in future the one year time limit between the registration of a complaint and the Commission's decision on the substance, the closure of a case or the dispatch of an Article 169 letter would be strictly applied."
"That has subsequently been the case."
"There are three main concerns evident throughout Mrs Schaffner's report."
"Firstly, the lack of transparency in Commission decisions on infringements."
"Secondly, the excessive number of Court judgments that have not been complied with."
"Thirdly, the inadequate diffusion of Community law."
"I report to the House with some satisfaction but without any complacency that in 1996 the Commission was particularly active in all three of those areas."
"First on transparency, since July 1996 the rule has been to publish press releases on Commission decisions, to issue reasoned opinions and to refer cases to the Court."
"The House will recall that until then the opposite rule applied."
"There could be no press release unless the Commission decided specifically that there should be."
"The Commission has already moved in the direction requested by Parliament."
"Instead of confidentiality which could, on occasion, be a source of mistakes and misunderstandings, the Commission has opted for openness in making its decisions public."
"I can report to the House that from my recall of the discussions in the Commission, this was unanimously and enthusiastically embraced."
"Similarly, in response to remarks made by the Ombudsman, the Commission always endeavours to secure the opinion of the complainant before deciding to close a case."
"Secondly, on the issue of penalties for failure to comply with Court judgments."
"As requested by this Parliament, the Commission has taken all the necessary steps to apply the second sub-paragraph of Article 171 and consequently to propose penalties against Member States which fail to comply with Court judgments."
"Following the publication in August last year of a communication on the application of this article, the Commission recently adopted a method for calculating the amount of penalty payments."
"The procedure can now, therefore, be considered to be operational."
"This should make for improved application of Community law in the Member States."
"As the rapporteur correctly points out, the Court's new ruling, allowing individuals to bring actions for damages against Member States that infringe Community law, offers citizens a new means of regress."
"Mrs Schaffner is also quite right to regard this as significant progress and application of this ruling in the Member States has already begun."
"Obviously, it is still too early to try to analyze the impact but the Commission is naturally taking a close interest in developments."
"Finally, on the subject of diffusion of Community law."
"Throughout 1996, the Commission continued its effort to improve the diffusion of Community law in the Member States by developing a number of programmes, in particular for the legal professions, programmes that have already been referred to in the course of the debate."
"Even though the diffusion of Community law is clearly a matter first and foremost for the Member States, the Commission seeks to provide the necessary impetus obviously within its competence."
"These references demonstrate, I hope, that the Commission regards the monitoring of the application of Community law to be a very important and useful activity and my colleagues and I warmly welcome the support for that activity given by this House."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise a matter with you."
"Today is the 25th anniversary of what is known as Bloody Sunday in Derry in Ireland."
"It is known as such because of the killing of 30 innocent civilians by the security forces."
"I have in my hand a resolution which is going before the House of Commons today on the issue of Bloody Sunday."
"Mr Andrews, I am sorry, but although your point is a very important one it has nothing to do with the Minutes."
"Mr President, I would merely like to ask the House to support Mr Hume's resolution."
"All right, Mr Andrews, the House has heard your advice and I imagine it will follow it."
"In any case, I say again, however important the matter may be it does not have very much to do with the Minutes."
"(Parliament approved the minutes)"
"Article K.9 of the Treaty on European Union"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lambraki (A4-0349/96), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the possible application of Article K.9 of the Treaty on European Union (COM(95)0566 - C4-0560/95)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lambraki's production of her report on the application of Article K9 comes at an interesting time."
"Discussion of the report in our committee took place at the same time as the Intergovernmental Conference was discussing the following questions: what is happening with the third pillar?"
"What is happening with the subjects covered by the third pillar?"
"How are they to be dealt with in future in the revised Treaty?"
"What is to be transferred to the first pillar, and what must on no account be transferred to it?"
"If transfers are made to the first pillar, what is to be democratically structured, and how?"
"So instead of turning immediately to a topic covered in the report, I shall begin with a question."
"We have heard several reports in recent weeks - it would be very interesting if Parliament's observers at the Intergovernmental Conference occasionally had an opportunity to comment on it - about plans to transfer certain fundamental areas of Community policy which Mrs Lambraki has touched on, such as the campaign against drugs or problems of immigration and asylum law, to a new pillar - 1a), as it were - meaning transferring them from the third pillar to the first, but using a kind of separate structure, whose purpose will be that although the result is Community law it lies outside the jurisdiction of the European Parliament."
"Let me repeat that: pillar 1a) - given that structure - transfers fundamental, absolutely necessary areas of policy to the level of Community law, to Community policy excluding the democratic public."
"That seems to me constantly to be the ideological background in the whole debate about Article K9 as well."
"The issue is that inexpensive declarations are made, that we naturally need a common asylum strategy."
"The term 'race to dishonour' has already been used here; I shall not adopt it, because it seems to me rather too harsh."
"But the constant levelling down of asylum standards to a lowest common denominator, which ultimately amounts to plugging the leaks, is a strategy which is more pronounced in some governments than in others, although it is always present."
"As far as the influence of the European Parliament is concerned - or at any rate this has been the case in our committee - both as regards Mrs d'Ancona's report on asylum policy and as regards the debate on Mrs Lambraki's report - the reaction of the Commission and the Council to parliamentary involvement is zero."
"In the case of the Commission, though, I will make an exception for Commissioner Gradin, who personally takes a very different view and deals very aggressively with Parliament."
"I particularly emphasize that, Commissioner: if I am going to tear a strip off the Commission as a whole, I must make a specific exception for the democratically inclined Commissioners."
"When we come to immigration and the drugs control policy, we have virtually the same situation: our debate always takes the same form."
"We need joint action, nobody disputes that."
"Situations exist which are no longer within the power of the Nation States of the European Union to control, nobody disputes that."
"The European Union is the level, the organizational form, within which we can cooperate most efficiently and come to grips with the problems most effectively."
"Nobody disputes that, either."
"The phenomenon whereby, in the course of the communitization of these areas of policy, the national parliaments are increasingly being excluded from the legislative process and from the process of control over the new organizations arising in this area is one side of the coin; and the non-transfer of democratic control and legislative powers to the European Parliament is the other side."
"This is creating a democracy shortfall in the European Union, which will take on dangerous dimensions unless swift and energetic action is taken to put a stop to it."
"Well, unfortunately, we have to say that we would gladly do that, but we don't have the power."
"So Mrs Lambraki's report comes at a very interesting time."
"We are now considering a report which, we know, describes machinery - the machinery of Article K9 - which, in conjunction with Article 110 of the Community Treaty could result in all these areas of policy - asylum, immigration, third-country nationals, the campaign against drugs and international fraud - all being transferred to the first pillar."
"But the trouble is that the report we are adopting here today may, at the time we adopt it, already have been overtaken by other considerations at the Intergovernmental Conference and the Council of Ministers."
"We may have our suspicions of that, though officially we know nothing at all, because this circumstance is the best proof that the question of the organization of policy around the subject areas can really only be described now as a bigger and bigger, more and more dangerous dedemocratization of policy in the European Union."
"Mrs Lambraki's report points out these phenomena and highlights ways in which things could be changed, but comes at a time when things may already have moved on and, to some extent, bypassed the European Parliament."
"That is the really regrettable feature of today's debate."
"Mr. President, Article K.9, the so called 'Bridge' for Article 100c only gives Parliament consultative powers in matters of legislation."
"From a democratic point of view, this is an absurd situation as neither the European Parliament nor the National Parliaments have control."
"The fact that Article K.9 is set out in this way is one example of the so called 'democratic shortcomings' ."
"The Danish problem illustrated in Edinburgh and so clearly shown by Mrs. Lambraki is another such problem."
"Article K.9 has been applied only once, in connection with schoolchildren going on school trips. This is not a particularly important matter considering the serious concerns that we have in Europe."
"For K.9 to apply, there must be a unanimous vote in the Council, a situation which is more or less impossible to achieve."
"The whole concept falls as a result of its own absurdity."
"The Commission shares this view."
"This legal, or more correctly, illegal state of affairs is a serious matter as it concerns the security of our people, an issue which becomes more important by the day. We also need to remember that this has a great impact on the fundamental attitude which our people have towards 'Europe' ."
"Quite simply, Article K.9 is serious proof of the need to simplify the Treaty and also the need for decision making by a qualified majority."
"The more areas which are brought within the Community Pillar, the fewer problems we will have in the Third Pillar."
"It is therefore important that all the forces in Europe strive towards this aim."
"Unfortunately, the report on K.9 has been presented so late that nothing new can be added and there is no room for manoeuvre before the Intergovernmental Conference revises the Treaty."
"But, there has been a positive development, despite the problems with the Treaty, in that Commissioner Gradin has initiated several good proposals on asylum, ' burden sharing' , immigration, corruption and synthetic drugs."
"Perhaps we can also hope to see a document on organised crime."
"Future developments will very likely prove the inadequacy of Article K.9."
"Raising problems on a report ought to be a matter for committee."
"Amendment proposals should first be discussed and then voted on by committee."
"Only then if no agreement can be reached should amendment proposals be put to the plenary session."
"To do this anyway, by including points which do not add anything new to the discussion cannot, in my view, be justified."
"Parliament needs to upgrade its methods of working by discouraging such action."
"It is partly for this reason that we are rejecting all amendment proposals apart from No. 5, which we would particularly like to include, as it refers to something which was not discussed in the report but which is worthy of support and emphasis."
"The Intergovernmental Conference should consider resolving the problems of internal security and making the appropriate amendments to K.9 as one of its most important tasks."
"The responsibility now lies with the governments of the Member States and we in the European Parliament, nota bene, ought to consider a thorough evaluation of K.9 after the Intergovernmental Conference and should not introduce a proposal which is inadequate to the task of promoting the safety, freedom and security of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my dear colleagues, prior to the summit in Dublin of 13 and 14 December 1996, President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl jointly signed a letter to the Irish president. In this letter they pointed out that current dispositions and procedures provided for by the Treaty on the European Union and governing cooperation in justice and home affairs are insufficient."
"Such a point of view seems to be shared by our Parliament, and in particular by you, Madam Rapporteur."
"This state of affairs, as Mrs Lambraki demonstrates, is reinforced by the technical and legal problems associated with the application of Article K9 of the Treaty, an article which currently constitutes a real passerelle between two possible political choices relating to the third pillar: communitarisation, on the one hand, and intergovernmental decision-making, on the other."
"This situation, which is characterised by the notable inadequacies of Article K9, is a matter of concern to all European constitutional decision-makers, from our Assembly, via the Council, to the Commission."
"However, if we share an identical diagnosis as to the organisational malaise of the third pillar, our group is not totally in agreement as to the method of cure."
"Allow me to express a few doubts on the matter."
"Indeed, the conclusions of this report make no mystery about arriving as quickly as possible at the total communitarisation of the third pillar."
"My group rejects this choice of 'going all the way' ."
"As far as we are concerned, we prefer to adopt a pragmatic strategy of giving Member States responsibility in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Wherever communitarisation appears useful for strengthening the security of European citizens, let us apply it."
"Wherever a platform common to the States is enough, there is no need to weigh the procedure down."
"It is in this spirit that the Council of Dublin set up, in a concrete way, a working group on judicial cooperation, in order to establish a practical point of view, an ad hoc list of dispositions for combatting cross-border crime, drugtrafficking, etc. This working group will give its conclusions next March, which will provide the IGC with a sort of data bank for the reconstruction of a more effective third pillar."
"This is the condition sine qua non for a Union in closer touch with its citizens, and therefore a more popular Union."
"Mr President, I will begin by giving our support to the Lambraki report."
"The procedure provided for by the Maastricht Treaty, and in particular in its Article K9, does raise problems which must cry out to us greatly as parliamentarians."
"Indeed, for the deficit of security for European citizens, which Europe is undertaking to reduce, within the framework of the European Union, a democratic deficit has been substituted, which results from the application of texts currently in force."
"The clumsiness of the procedure provided for by the Treaty, for just a slight communitarisation of the dispositions provided for within the framework of the third pillar, has already been mentioned."
"We share the attitude of those who pronounce themselves in favour of the communitarisation of the third pillar and a more effective parliamentary control, or in any case, one which is worthy of the name."
"I myself have had the privilege of writing a report for the Intergovernmental Conference to that effect, which I have placed in the hands of the Prime Minister of my own country. He has undertaken, furthermore, to take it to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This report highlights in particular the way in which national parliaments should be able to engage in the parliamentary follow-up of European dispositions, particularly in the discussion of conventions concluded within the framework of the third pillar."
"The difficulty lies in the fact that once the dispositions are ratified, European parliaments make an act of faith in the creation of a new European law while depriving themselves of parliamentary control."
"And if this parliamentary control, previously exercised by national parliaments, is not replaced by any disposition empowering the European parliament to monitor this procedure and to carry out its dual vocation of political control and impetus, then, for the lack of security, which we all wish to combat, is substituted a lack of democracy. And I think that is one of the points which deserves discussion within this Parliament."
"Needless to say, Mr President, we are all against the creation of a pillar 1A, the effect of which would be to deprive the European Parliament of its rights and its prerogatives in terms of control."
"Priority should be given to the communitarisation of the dispositions provided for within the context of the third pillar."
"The only way to respond to the wish shared very broadly by our Assembly is to invite the Intergovernmental Conference once again to make some serious progress on the subject."
"If the Intergovernmental Conference had to respond to our wish, expressed by a very large majority of our Parliament, we would be able to say to the citizens of Europe that we had succeeded in curbing this dual deficit of democracy and parliamentary control, for this control should be the norm in our parliamentary system."
"Mr President, I do not have the time to go into all the details, but the point I have had the chance to present here seems to us crucial."
"In the eyes of the liberals, especially, it is essential that some progress is made in the matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz, I have enjoyed listening to the various defences put forward today."
"I feel we are indulging not just in a comic opera debate, but in a comic opera debate on something which in fact is no longer on the agenda at all."
"The fact is that everyone knows - and Mr Schulz even said as much - that the question of the transition from K9 to K1 does not arise; the question that arises is to what extent the third pillar is or is not, for practical purposes, being absorbed in the first."
"All Members have said the same thing: all that is happening, the way we are dealing with things and negotiating at present, is that we get more and more intergovernmental agreements and intercontinental agreements and less communitization, meaning less European debate that can be monitored both by the European Parliament and by the European Court of Justice."
"This is fatal!"
"This is an abandonment of the ideal of a European institution which is also required to monitor sovereign institutions."
"That is why I believe that we must do more, be more aggressive in attacking governments when the issue is developing the role of Parliament."
"But we must also resolutely attack the philosophy of this debate."
"We always say that Europe means more freedom for its citizens."
"But we are catering for a security phobia and at the same time driving out freedom."
"Because we say: more security and less and less freedom."
"The classic example is Schengen, the argument about freedom of movement and the implementation of Article 7a. We have decided in favour of freedom of movement."
"We cannot implement it, so all we do is conclude intergovernmental agreements to safeguard security."
"That is why I believe that this report has simply come too late."
"That is why I call this a comic opera debate."
"It is no longer on the agenda."
"What is on the agenda is the debate about the freedom of the citizen, and I would ask all those who rightly believe that Europe has security problems not to confuse the protection of the citizen with the abolition of the necessary freedoms."
"The citizen wants security in his life, but he also wants more freedom, and at present we are providing that only in a limited way and to a limited extent."
"That is why our group will be abstaining in the vote on this report, because the report serves no purpose."
"That is the simple, unvarnished fact today: it no longer serves any purpose at all!"
"Instead, we must argue about the third pillar when it becomes a pillar 1a, as it is really communitized, so that we have European controls exerted by the Parliament and the European Court of Justice."
"To that extent, I agree with the remarks made by a previous speaker, Mr Schulz."
"Mr President, on the occasion of a technical debate on the use of Article K9, the Lambraki report sends a resounding cry to the Intergovernmental Conference to integrate into the competence of the Community many matters associated with the security of individuals, for example policies on asylum, crossing external borders, immigration and many others."
"But as much as it seems to us justified to deal with these policies as subjects of common interest, that is to coordinate our efforts better at European level, it would also seem absurd to remove them from the competence of the nations and national parliaments, because that is what the demand for communitarisation means in reality."
"What the Lambraki report is asking for, like all other reports by this Assembly which have tackled the subject previously, is that the nations should not have the last word on these matters, which would be dealt with by a majority in Council, with the right of codecision by the European Parliament, the monopoly of initiative of the Commission and jurisdiction of the Court of Justice."
"This bypassing of national parliaments is totally unacceptable, for even with the formula involving codecision of the European Parliament, it would amount to a weakening of democracy, a distancing of the decision-making centres from citizens, and also, incidentally, to the unappealing prospect of seeing all of these sensitive matters dealt with in a lax manner at European level."
"Cooperation, yes; the dispossession of national democracies, no."
"This should be our line of conduct."
"Mr President, the problems of asylum, of immigration, of external border crossings, and of drug trafficking are a great cause for concern to the citizens of the European nations."
"This is why there are two reasons for not communitarising them."
"The first is that conditions and traditions are very different from one country to another."
"The second is that people, the electorate, must be able to express and assert their point of view."
"Now, by communitarising these sectors, control by the people would be made even more difficult."
"This, moreover, is probably the objective sought by those who are wanting communitarisation."
"What is needed, on the contrary, is to make it easier for the people, for peoples, for the electorate, to exercise control, by making it possible at the level of States - over and above the role of the national parliaments - as is the case with the Swiss version of democracy, to resort to referendum, and referendum initiated by the people."
"It is on this condition, and this condition alone, that democracy will be alive and not, as is too often the case today, hijacked by technocratic and decadent elites."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying that I give my complete approval to the content of the report by Mrs Lambraki."
"Its pragmatic position bearing the hallmark of wisdom is completely justified, for the Commission's communication itself bears the stamp of common sense."
"We are not going to embark upon a heavy and uncertain procedure, and to be quite frank, one destined to fail, at this point in time, just when possibilities for improving the operation of Union policies relating to justice and home affairs are being considered in the negotiations of the IGC."
"What is more, the application of Article K9 would have fallen far short of the resolution of all the problems encountered in this domain, particularly with respect to the powers of the European Parliament."
"On the other hand, it is about the progress of the work done at the IGC that we must be vigilant."
"The Irish presidency has tried to give a positive impetus by putting Member States to work on a concrete proposal which tries to provide responses to the many criticisms made thus far about the operation of the third pillar."
"Indeed, whether we are talking about application of K9, communitarising the third pillar, or adopting appropriate dispositions in a pillar 1A, what is actually at stake?"
"The Irish presidency has named it: it is ensuring the establishment of an effective decision-making process, founded, at least in the long term, on the qualified majority and the guarantee of democratic and jurisdictional control."
"This declaration of principles coincides with points of view expressed many times over in our Assembly, but sadly, this objective meets strong resistance from certain Member States and national parliaments, and I am thinking in particular of the French Parliament."
"And yet, with the progress of the Single Market, everyone recognises that, with regard to the freedom of movement of persons, and even if it is only partial and outside Community procedures, harmonisation of certain legislation and practices is essential, and, besides, it is already happening."
"I am thinking of asylum and immigration, for example."
"Of course, this Europeanisation in fact has the disadvantage that it strips national parliaments of a part of their prerogative."
"We might regret this, we might try to remedy it, but it is a fact."
"There is, therefore a democratic deficit at national level, which must be compensated for by progress in democratic control at European level."
"And this should be the role of the European Parliament."
"Now, currently, we know where the matter stands."
"Article K9 is a snare, because it is an instrument in the hands of the president which he can use as he pleases."
"Furthermore, the Court of Justice is deliberately distanced from cooperation in the third pillar, and this creates a jurisdictional vacuum, which is, at the very least, paradoxical in such a sensitive area, in which the rights and freedoms of the people living in the territory of the Union are at stake."
"Having pointed this out, is it possible to refuse any power to the European Parliament and the Court of Justice, as a recent report did which was put forward for vote in the French Parliament, and to be happy just to claim more power for national parliaments?"
"This last point should certainly be studied, and I would like to point out that most of the resolutions of our Assembly on the third pillar pronounce themselves in favour of an increased role for national parliaments."
"But this cannot be enough."
"How can we recognise the need for European harmonisation and, at the same time, preach renationalisation of democratic and jurisdictional controls?"
"These divergences in the appreciation of the parties who will have to pronounce themselves on the IGC are not encouraging."
"That is why Mrs Lambraki is right to demand from the Commission an evaluation of the gains of the IGC to envisage some sort of initiative for Article K9, in the event that these results are too disappointing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Bendit has described this debate as resembling a comic opera."
"Well, comic operas are often rather slight but entertaining."
"By comparison, Mr CohnBendit's remarks were, at any rate, not entertaining."
"I feel that we are conducting a ghost debate, not just because of the echoing emptiness of Parliament but mainly because Article K9 has long since become obsolete."
"It plays the same part in the Maastricht Treaty as the appendix does in the human body - it may once have been significant, but it has long since been overtaken by evolution."
"So what we have here is a ghost debate."
"Article K9 died of its own inadequacy."
"It has occasionally been described as a bridge to the first pillar, but this bridge was mined from the start."
"Partly because it required a unanimous vote in the Council - and you know how hard that is to achieve in contentious matters - and partly, too, because the agreements in question had to be ratified in accordance with the various constitutional provisions of the nation states, a process that can take forever."
"K9 has demonstrated its total inadequacy and is now the subject of discussions in the negotiations of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"But even if nothing really new arises at the Intergovernmental Conference regarding the transfer of responsibilities from the third pillar to the first, even then we cannot invoke Article K9, because it has proved unwieldy."
"Something else has become very clear, which is that we still have here an unresolved conflict between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The point is that the third pillar includes Article K6, which grants Parliament the right to be informed, and indeed regularly informed, and to be consulted on the principal aspects of the activities - to quote the somewhat laboured wording of the Treaty."
"As a general rule, the Council has failed to apply these provisions and has circumvented them."
"If the Treaty is essentially maintained in this form after the Intergovernmental Conference, there will be no way of avoiding either a severe conflict with the Council or an interinstitutional agreement which clearly regulates when Parliament is to be informed on matters relating to the third pillar and, above all, when we are to be consulted."
"The fact of the matter is that this Parliament has never been properly consulted at all."
"Consultation means that when the Council wants to adopt a decision, it submits it to us before adopting it; it means that when it has a draft which is ready for adoption it offers Parliament the opportunity to comment on it; it means that the Council considers what Parliament has to say and accepts its reasons."
"Naturally, the Council is not bound by what Parliament wants, but it is required to give careful consideration to Parliament's view."
"That has never happened yet, and in every important agreement of recent times the principle has been systematically and criminally disregarded."
"That is where the conflict lies - the conflict with which we in this House have to concern ourselves, and which we shall have to tackle as soon as the Intergovernmental Conference is at an end."
"The other bone of contention is the procedure."
"There is an astonishing degree of unanimity in this House in support of the view that at least parts of the third pillar require communitization, such as the universally mentioned areas of asylum, immigration, visas and external border controls."
"I am amazed to hear it."
"Community law on asylum would mean a uniform law on asylum throughout Europe, from Finland through Germany and France to Portugal and Spain."
"May I ask what form such an asylum law would take?"
"It amazes me to hear Mr Cohn-Bendit declaring in favour of a common law on asylum."
"I have never heard any demand from the Greens on asylum law which would have even the faintest prospect of becoming the basis of a common law on asylum, to be valid in the United Kingdom as well as in Sweden and Greece."
"Because I am absolutely convinced, for example, that other European partners would not unconditionally accept the German yardstick as a model."
"Among other things, that would require us Germans, too, to review our position on asylum with a view to harmonizing it with other countries' laws, rather than just adhering to our own standards."
"These are all examples of the implications of demanding a common law on asylum, and I doubt if it would be any easier to find common ground in other areas, either."
"First, we need to agree on procedures which will be acceptable to all and in which the role of Parliament is at least described in the same way as it is already set out in the Maastricht Treaty. Secondly, we should then turn to the question of substantive law and look for common ground, and the only way will be for there to be give and take on all sides."
"That applies to the Germans just as much as it does to the British, French and all the others."
"Mr. President, the matter now under discussion concerns a number of important subjects including immigration and asylum, visas and the fight against drugs, the traffic in people and international crime."
"It is my opinion that these are matters which we in Europe must resolve together, and that is the most important point."
"The question is how best to resolve them."
"There is a need for stronger international and European cooperation and more effective measures."
"But, this does not mean that everything be transferred from the Third to the First Pillar and that decisions shall be taken by a qualified majority."
"Let us look at drugs policy for example: in Sweden and Scandinavia we have a restrictive drugs policy."
"We are not entirely convinced that we will gain a better, more effective policy if it is moved up to a level where decisions can be taken by a qualified majority."
"It could lead to a deterioration of our policy with greater liberalisation and legalisation. Both of these measures are directly contrary to those actions we consider vital to get to grips with the drug problem."
"We also know that many of our EU citizens and other European peoples believe that drug policy and the fight against organised crime should be given high priority, and rightly so."
"We must take action."
"But many also have doubts about transferring more decisions from national level to supranational EU level."
"We must find a way of resolving this conflict."
"Transfer of all the areas mentioned in this report from the Third Pillar to the First would involve a huge shift of power from national Parliaments to EU level in matters which are considered typically internal and national by our people, for example, matters concerning the police, customs, civil rights and criminal law."
"National Parliaments will also have reduced influence of course if these decisions are transferred to EU level."
"Mr. President, the problems of immigration, asylum, narcotics and crime must be resolved."
"In my view, they are best resolved through combined action, programmes and plans rather than by amendments of a constitutional nature and the transfer of decision making from national to supranational level."
"Mr. President, it is with a sense of disappointment and sadness that I have read this report and listened to the various speeches."
"Everyone says the same, that interstate cooperation, e.g. the Third Pillar, is not working, that it is not sufficiently effective and that it must be abolished."
"Neither the rapporteur nor the committee has analysed what it is that is not functioning or defined what is meant by effective."
"Nor is the question being asked, why is it not working, which is surely the central point."
"The simplest and most obvious response is to blame the right of veto and the fact that decisions must be taken unanimously."
"Nobody is asking why it is so difficult to reach unanimous decisions."
"The obvious answer is that the people and the ministers of the Member States are not prepared, nor do they have the right, to transfer legal matters to the EU and to 'Brussels' ."
"For the majority of the peoples of Europe, the legal system adopted by their National Parliaments is a matter of identity and democracy."
"It is perhaps even more important than the matter of a national currency."
"The proposal now is 'communitarise' all or parts of the Third Pillar under the sacred flag of effectiveness."
"In plain language what this means is that we wish to give the EU a mandate, the right to trample over individual Member States and people, all in the name of increased effectiveness."
"It is even claimed that this will increase democracy and bring Europe and its peoples closer together. This is absurd."
"I strongly believe that the result will be exactly the opposite: the distance between decisions makers and citizens in the Union will increase, both metaphorically and geographically."
"Criticism against the Union and 'the rule of Brussels' will increase and there is a risk that this will feed extremist nationalist parties and organisations and thereby add to the tension and unrest in the Union."
"Is this what we want?"
"No, let us keep and develop the interstate cooperation in the Third Pillar."
"Let us proceed at a pace acceptable to our people."
"Let us not add to the contempt felt for politicians but instead respect the constitutional laws of the Member States."
"In all essential respects I agree with what my two Swedish colleagues have just said."
"We are dealing here with a theme, the third pillar, which provokes fairly predictable natural responses, and there are two main reasons for this."
"Firstly it is central to the ongoing unresolved conflict between Parliament and the Council, and secondly it concerns an area of integration, perhaps the most central of all areas of integration."
"The conclusion of this phantom debate, appendectomy, or whatever else one wishes to call it, is very simple, namely that this article K9, which is supposed to serve as a passerelle for the transfer of issues from the third pillar to Community matters, has never been used."
"It is unusable."
"Amongst other reasons, this is because of those troublesome Danes who have opposed the adoption of article K9."
"The conclusion, therefore, is that it must be removed and that it must be regarded unconditionally as a Community matter."
"What we have here is an appeal to the government conference."
"I agree with Georges Berthu who spoke on this matter earlier."
"It concerns questions which are at the heart of the right to national self-determination."
"There is no question of transfer to Community matters."
"This is perhaps the most significant undermining of a right to democratic self-determination which belongs to the individual nations."
"We cannot on any grounds support this appeal to the government conference to have it made a Community matter."
"Indeed we will strive against this."
"Mr President, in my view Mrs Lambraki has handled the very difficult issue of the transfer of areas of competence from the inter-government sphere to, effectively, the Community sphere prudently and with a sense of responsibility."
"I think we can agree with the conclusion that the third pillar is moribund."
"Perhaps the most characteristic example recently has been the total inaction of the European Union in the face of the serious revelations concerning the involvement of people in high positions in Turkey in drug trafficking. The European Union has simply not existed."
"The German courts have spoken, the European body which monitors the movement of drugs has spoken, a number of persons in positions of responsibility have spoken, but the European Union has been completely out of the frame."
"Certainly, in view of that situation, we ought to avail ourselves of the greater potential for action which the transfer of competence to the Community would offer. With great care and sensitivity, of course, in regard to the matters that previous speakers have raised, and provided that we do everything that is necessary to ensure that in giving the European Parliament and the other institutions the potential for effective intervention and monitoring we do not create a new democratic deficit."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report because her conclusions are very close to those drawn by the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Article K9, and we should be clear about this, exists in the Maastricht Treaty as a sop to those Member states who oppose the inter-governmentalization of justice and home affairs."
"It was a sop to those who lost the battle to communitarize justice and home affairs matters."
"In theory, as we have heard, K9 allows for a transfer of certain policy areas from pillar three to the Community pillar."
"In practice, it does no such thing for there is a double lock on Article K9."
"Firstly, as we have heard, the Council must act unanimously in order to transfer the powers listed in K1(1) to K1(6) and having agreed the transfer, the Council must then refer the matter to all fifteen national Parliaments so they may ratify the decision."
"Theoretically we could have other voting systems but in practice we then have unanimity for any matter transferred from the third pillar to the Community pillar."
"So it is unlikely to be used and the fact that it has never been used is an indication of just now unlikely it is."
"In addition, even if we do make the transfer, the legal base would be 100c so this Parliament would only be consulted about the matter and would have no other rights than simple consultation."
"In addition, of course, it does not cover all the matters in the third pillar."
"Issues like customs cooperation, Europol, judicial cooperation and criminal matters would not be covered by any potential transfer."
"K9 is clearly not a panacea for the problems encountered in implementing the third pillar."
"If we in this Parliament were given an example of a third world country that allowed asylum policy, border controls, the right of third country nationals, the fighting of terrorism, the combatting of fraud, the combatting of drug addiction to escape parliamentary or judicial control, we would be horrified."
"We would be so horrified that month-in month-out we would be passing urgencies in this Parliament condemning the situation."
"Yet we live with that on a daily basis in this institution."
"Why?"
"It seems to me that the operation and existence of the third pillar shows unambiguously that of the four fundamental freedoms that this Community is supposed to be based on, the freedom of movement of persons is the lesser one, even in a Union that does not tire of telling us that we now live in a citizens' Europe."
"Until we move the third pillar into the Community structure it will be clear that Europe remains overwhelmingly an economic enterprise."
"If we are to speak to the people of Europe, then the people's rights must be covered by the people's Court and the people's Parliament."
"K9 might appear on the map of the European Union as a passerelle but if it is a passerelle , it is a footpath strewn with boulders and difficulties and we want to get rid of it and move it into the Community structure."
"Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mrs. Lambraki on her excellent report concerning Article K.9."
"The issues surrounding the application of this 'passerelle' are controversial."
"The rapporteur has analysed this complicated political issue in a thorough and well balanced way."
"The Commission and the Council of Ministers have studied the possibility of applying Article K.9 on two occasions."
"The first time was just a few months after the Treaty came into force."
"At that time, both the Commission and the Council of Ministers came to the conclusion that insufficient time had elapsed to assess the situation properly."
"The second time was in November 1995, when the Commission presented a report to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which recommended that Article K.9 should not be applied."
"The reason for this was that preparation work for the Intergovernmental Conference had already commenced and more and more people were beginning to realise the need for a radical overhaul of the total cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs, in other words, the cooperation within the Third Pillar."
"Our conclusion, at that time, was that, at best it would be meaningless to propose the use of Article K.9 and at worst counterproductive."
"There was no doubt that any attempt to use this Article to transfer issues to the First Pillar was doomed to failure."
"As I have pointed out previously, and now reiterate for you, such a proposal would require either a vote in the Danish Parliament or a referendum."
"The only realistic way to achieve a more effective manner of working is to transfer once and for all as much as possible of the cooperation in the Third Pillar to the First Pillar."
"When we discussed this issue in the Commission, we were anxious that the decision should not give rise to misunderstanding in the European Parliament."
"For this reason, I have repeatedly stated the Commission's stand on this issue."
"It is with great satisfaction now that I see that the rapporteur has arrived at the same conclusion in her report."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is now moving to a decisive stage."
"This is particularly true for matters of Justice and Home Affairs."
"The draft Treaty text produced by the Irish Presidency at the conference in Dublin in December largely followed the guidelines proposed by the Commission."
"In other respects the proposal is less than ambitious."
"The Commission is presenting its views on these sections in the continuing discussions through the participation of Commissioner Oreja."
"It is our opinion that the European Parliament should have its say on all matters covered in the Third Pillar, including budget matters in which Parliament itself must play a full part."
"The remaining months before the end of the Conference will naturally be marked by intensive negotiations."
"It is important that, in these discussions, we concentrate on achieving as good a negotiated result as possible."
"This is the only way in which we can tackle the existing challenges for the cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs."
"Of course, this does not only apply to the Commission but to all the members of this house who should try to influence their own National Governments."
"It is after all particularly important that a huge effort is made to convince them of the importance of changing the cooperation within the Third Pillar so that it becomes better and more democratic and so that we can take on all those serious matters which our voters consider that we should tackle."
"Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate."
"In compiling my report on this difficult legal and political subject my intention was not so much to put forward solutions but, rather, to try to eliminate the misconceptions that have existed."
"And to assume that Article K.9 can solve the problem of the third pillar certainly is a misconception."
"I think that I have achieved that."
"We no longer have misconceptions."
"I will agree with Mrs Gradin. What we have to do now - every one of us at every level, the Commission itself and the members of this parliament and of the national parliaments - is to press the governments in the same direction."
"I believe that the time for action in this place has passed, Mrs Gradin. If the Commission had brought its thoughts to us earlier, as we wanted it to, we would perhaps have had more time to influence the discussions in the intergovernmental conference."
"As it is now, I can agree in part with Mr Cohn-Bendit that events appear to have overtaken us in terms of time."
"Madam President, today we commemorate the 25th anniversary of a horrific event in which 13 people were killed at a civil rights march in Derry in Northern Ireland."
"Yesterday in the House of Commons John Hume our colleague tabled a motion supported by many Members from different parties asking for a new international tribunal to investigate that event."
"I should like to ask this House to lend its support to my colleague John Hume in trying to find out the truth so that justice will prevail."
"Considering that we are voting on the Reding report on terrorism today, it would be appropriate for this House to commemorate and pay tribute to the victims of state terrorism, as well as all forms of paramilitary terrorism in our fight to ensure that people's lives and the right to life is secured for ever."
"Although we are not talking about a true motion of procedure, I am happy to make a note of your statement Mr Crowley, which is at one with the intervention by Mr Andrews this morning"
"Votes"
"Madam President, I just wanted to tell you and the Assembly that I have detected in the joint motion for a resolution, tabled by seven political groups, a number of significant translation errors in some versions, in particular the Spanish and English versions."
"They affect the preamble and not the main body of the motion and its sub-paragraphs."
"Could I therefore ask you to call upon the Assembly services to make sure that all versions are correctly translated on the basis of the original version presented to this body by the seven political groups."
"Mrs Fraga Est√©vez, I will undertake to ensure that this is checked as carefully as possible."
"On the subject of amendment 3:"
"There seems to be a problem regarding amendment 3."
"It is worded as follows: ' - having regard to its resolution of 25 October 1996 on the communication from the Commission on the implementation of technical measures in the common fisheries policy' ."
"I have been informed that Mr Gallagher would like this wording to be modified as follows: ' - having regard to the report by Mr Gallagher, adopted by the European Parliament, on the communication from the Commission' ."
"I must tell you frankly, this seems extremely complicated to me, and in addition Mr Gallagher is not here."
"Therefore I am going to put amendment 3 of the Group Union for Europe to the vote in the wording we know."
"Madam President, I should apologise on behalf of Mr Gallagher who is not at his desk at the moment."
"I have just been informed that in the original text Mr Gallagher's name was mentioned."
"It was taken out and this is just to reinsert it into the original text."
"There seems to be some misunderstanding."
"Mr Crowley, thank you for apologising for Mr Gallagher's absence, but it is not customary practice to quote the names of rapporteurs."
"Resolutions are put forward and everyone knows, of course, that they relate to a report which has been backed by one of our colleagues, but generally no reference is made to the names of rapporteurs."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, two amendments are being voted on - Amendment Nos 1 and 11, one tabled by the Socialist Group and the other by the PPE, Socialist, Liberal and GUE Groups."
"I would like to give Mr Schulz the floor to see if we can reach an agreement and vote on just one of the two amendments which are practically identical."
"Madam President, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 11 deal with the same problem, and I would like to say a brief word about that."
"In the debate on this report there was a certain amount of excitement about the question: Can a terrorist organization be accurately defined?"
"Is it possible to define accurately what it means?"
"Mrs Reding commendably accepted this challenge and included a definition in her report, which makes one thing clear - within the rule-of-law community of the European Union there can be no legal protection for terrorist acts or terrorist organizations of any kind whatsoever. I want to make that completely clear here."
"Organizations like the IRA and ETA cannot expect any protection within the European Union on the basis of any law whatsoever."
"It was in order to make that clear that these two amendments were introduced."
"So I could withdraw my Amendment No 1, because its content is virtually the same as that of Amendment No 11, if we could agree that we could add six more words to the English version of Amendment No 11, adding 'within the meaning of this resolution' after the words '... cooperation with an armed group...' ."
"That makes it absolutely clear that what I have just said is covered by this report."
"Then I can take back No 1 and we could then vote jointly on No 11."
"My dear colleagues, we are not reopening the debate, things must be clear."
"Mrs Reding, I wish to know whether you accept Mr Schulz's proposal."
"Yes, Madam President, it is an excellent proposal, and I would ask my colleagues to vote in great numbers for amendment 11."
"I am going to anticipate slightly, and ask our colleagues if there are any objections."
"For Mr Schulz to be able to withdraw his amendment 1, you must understand that this implies that he has our Assembly's commitment that it accepts the oral amendment to amendment 11."
"I am therefore asking the Assembly, in slight anticipation, whether it has any objection to there being an oral amendment to amendment 11."
"(The Assembly did not oppose the proposal)"
"Mr Schulz, you may therefore withdraw your amendment."
"Madam President, Mr Schulz, there is just one thing I am not clear about."
"You said neither ETA nor the IRA nor anyone else would be protected."
"But there is a principle in law that every defendant is entitled to the protection of the law until proved guilty."
"The French call it la pr√©somption d'innocence , to use a European term for once, so it is..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"We cannot get into a debate."
"Amendment 1 is therefore withdrawn from the vote."
"Madam President, regarding the oral amendment proposed by Mr Schulz."
"Am I correct in understanding that Mr Schulz's intention is that legal protection will be denied to people who are accused of terrorist crimes?"
"That is how it came across in the interpretation."
"My dear colleagues, we are not voting on the intentions of Mr Schulz."
"Mr Schulz has proposed the withdrawal of his amendment on two conditions: that the PPE accepts an oral amendment to his amendment 11, and he has made this oral amendment quite explicit."
"Mrs Reding, the rapporteur, gave her agreement, on condition, of course, that there was no objection to this oral amendment being put to the vote."
"Therefore it will be, at the time we vote on amendment 11."
"This is all quite clear."
"The debate on the content is now over."
"Madam President, I quite understand that Honourable Members would like to move on."
"But as the debate we are holding here at present has caused a great deal of tumult in some Member States, I should like to repeat one sentence: we do not need to make a special point here of saying that a State that is governed by the principles of the rule of law must also observe those principles in its legal organization, no matter who the accused may be."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, too, is well aware of that, and his request to speak was merely for show."
"But it is important that we should make this point here: no terrorist and no terrorist organization can derive any political legitimacy from a law..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"My dear colleagues, may I remind you that there are explanations of vote, which you may use at your leisure."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, obviously we have voted against this report, which aims to set up thought policing and brainwashing through the media, in particular."
"But, while taking account of that and of an amendment which was adopted, we are rather surprised that there were so many votes for and so few votes against and abstentions."
"Indeed, amendment 5, which was adopted, and which therefore figures in the final resolution, demands, I quote 'that immigrants from outside the Community should receive equal treatment regarding economic and social rights, recognition of civil, cultural and political rights, particularly the right to vote in local elections for non-European foreigners residing in Europe' ."
"Well, it would be interesting to see our colleagues from the Christian Democrat and Union for Europe groups, who abstained or voted for the report, explaining to those who elected them that they voted for the right to vote for nonEuropean foreigners in local elections in this way."
"I am sure their supporters would be very surprised to learn which way they voted."
"The annual motion for a resolution on racism, as prepared by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Citizens' Rights of our Assembly, and as presented this morning, seemed to show an improvement on texts of previous years."
"Indeed, for once, the usual amalgam of 'racism' and 'control of immigration' was carefully avoided."
"Sadly, these good intentions did not last for long against the amendments which have just been voted in in the plenary session."
"We note in it that the European Parliament wishes to 'point out the positive contribution which immigrants are making to European society' (amendment 8), that it 'calls on the Member States to develop their immigration policy in close connection with an adequate integration policy' (amendment 2), an integration policy which is itself made explicit by amendment 5: the European Parliament 'calls for non-Community immigrants to enjoy equal treatment with regard to economic and social rights, and the recognition of civic, cultural and political rights, including the right to vote in local elections for those who have been resident in a Member State for more than five years...' ."
"This position seems to us totally unacceptable."
"To start with, it underestimates the reality of contemporary immigration, which essentially is motivated by the economic self-destruction of certain third party countries, and which constitutes a heavy burden, rather than an opportunity, for members of the European Union."
"Secondly, the immigrant population which arrives accidentally in our countries under these condition, must not be considered as having a vocation to stay here for good."
"Finally, it is not acceptable to erase the difference between citizens and foreigners by aligning the rights of the latter progressively with those of the former."
"Indeed, a nation is a community of fate which citizens share."
"You cannot claim the rights without assuming the duties in it."
"And to assume them you just have to go through the naturalisation procedure, which those concerned are free to request."
"Secondly, you will note that the resolution voted in asks for European competence for combatting against racism, as well as the creation of a 'European observatory for racism and xenophobia' , which, in our opinion, would definitely not bring about any further concrete achievements, other than administration and additional expense."
"These are the reasons why we opposed this resolution."
"Quite regularly, on the occasion of many reports and topical matters, the European Parliament expresses its rejection of all kinds of racism and xenophobia. It does so clearly and often by a large majority."
"This year, this rejection will take on a particular meaning and profile, with the official announcement, on 31 January, of: 1997, European Year Against Racism, in The Hague."
"I would like to recall here my determination and my commitment to the fight against the vile, racist and fascist beast which is developing throughout the whole of Europe in many, and dangerous guises."
"That is why we should support the step which the European Union is taking in the symbolic expression which has led it to declare a year against racism."
"It is democracy which is at stake."
"Regarding this, I am disappointed by and condemn the attitude of the British government in opposing the creation of a European observatory for racism, an element which could have been decisive in determining the success of this year."
"Nevertheless, and even if it is necessary to react, symbolically and every time revolting acts of racism are committed, it is also our duty to fight on a daily basis to stamp out this iniquitous, and downright vile phenomenon."
"Racism is an ill which infiltrates itself insidiously and which feeds on the accumulation of reasons for unhappiness, which result in the search for scapegoats."
"So yes, Parliament is right to attack racism on a regular basis, but it must do all it can to contribute to this struggle, at the level of European citizens, for human integrity, freedom and democracy."
"It should, we should therefore denounce the discourse and actions of fascists, whether 'neo' or otherwise, but also, and particularly of their accomplices, who can often be found within 'much more respectable' political groupings and even governments."
"Everyday racism, common racism, is the breeding ground for the racism we are denouncing in our resolutions."
"It must be hunted down wherever it is hiding, and that includes the benches of our Parliament."
"It is important that the European Union should have proclaimed 1997 'European Year against Racism' ."
"This should lead to all kinds of actions in a European framework to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in a more co-ordinated and effective way."
"It should also force the Intergovernmental Conference to include in the revised Treaty a clear, concise and forthright pledge to combat racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, given the steady increase in ideologies tinged with fanaticism and dangerous fascist ideologies."
"All kinds of fundamentalism translated into frightful actions loaded with violence and recalling the horror of the Holocaust."
"Silence is an accomplice: the 'We did not know' used as justification in the past and even today by so many people means that we have to act and proclaim time and time again that our culture, in the 20th century, is partly one of cultural and racial mixtures - that is its wealth."
"Racism must be fought at all levels and in every way."
"This is why we have voted for this resolution, despite the fact that it contains certain points on which we hold a completely different opinion."
"These include the harmonisation of asylum and immigration policies, the transfer of actions against racism to the First Pillar and the strengthening of legal instruments."
"But we are all agreed on the fact that we wish to assist wholeheartedly in the fight against racism and the resolution does contain many good and important points."
"The Austrian Freedom Party Members fully concur with the content of the motion for a resolution by Mr Ford and Mr Oostlander - subject to the reservation mentioned in Mr Lukas's speech - whereby the list which appears in indent 6 is to be understood as an enumerative recapitulation of previous resolutions on the subject in question but not as confirmation of the content of the resolution of 9 May 1996 regarding the ostracizing of the FP√ñ and its leader, Dr J√∂rg Haider."
"Fisheries Council"
"In respect of the vote which we have just held on the Fisheries Council, my Group welcomes approval of Amendment No 5 tabled by the GUE/NGL Group, but I am personally upset that Amendment No 7 tabled by the same Group was not approved."
"Both amendments refer to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco which is one of the most important of the Community's Agreements, and which in my opinion has been tantamount to an abandonment of responsibilities by the Commission in accepting the extension of the biological moratorium period from two to four months without sufficient guarantees - or rather without any guarantees at all - that Morocco will actually comply with that biological moratorium."
"Therefore, I hope that the Commission will pay more attention to this subject and in the future will look very carefully into any concessions which it might make, bearing in mind that at this very moment Morocco is the beneficiary of major aids from the European Community."
"Our fishing sector deserves protection and we cannot abandon our fishermen to the whim of political decisions taken by the Moroccan Government which might be inspired by other considerations."
"Thomas report (A4-0414/96)"
") We do not see the need to adopt a joint forestry strategy at this point in time."
"The Union currently faces enormous problems adapting its Agricultural and Regional Policies to allow for an enlargement Eastwards."
"It is inappropriate to adopt a further joint strategy in another area, particularly as there are already well developed Forestry Policies in the individual countries."
"Each country has a forestry policy and authorities for the Forestry Industry."
"There is also considerable international cooperation on Forestry Policy within the FAO and ECE for example and well developed international cooperation concerned with mapping forest damage in Europe."
"A joint forestry policy would be of doubtful value because there are such different problems in the countries of the Union."
"Grazing, for example, is a serious problem in the Mediterranean countries while the Scandinavian countries allocate resources on preventing open meadows and grazing ground from becoming overgrown."
"Forest fires are not a serious problem in the Scandinavian countries either."
"Scandinavia also has a well organised environmental certification scheme, and it is well known that competitor countries such as Canada and the USA are exerting pressure to introduce common certification standards at a lower level than those currently in force in Scandinavia."
"There is a considerable risk therefore that environmental standards for the Swedish Forestry sector would be reduced by the implementation of common certification."
"Finally, we consider it unnecessary for the Union to increase its expenditure as a result of this document."
"If all the proposals are passed, the Union's expenditure will increase by 350 million ECUs."
"The bulk of this amount is allocated to two subsidies, firstly to combat forest fires (which means that the subsidy will primarily benefit the Mediterranean countries) and also to AVS countries, primarily the former colonies."
"We consider this to be wrong."
"If Parliament wishes to increase its support to combat forest fires there is already a budget entry for this and if we wish to support forestry in developing countries this is best done through the normal channels for development aid."
"There is no need for a joint forestry policy in the EU."
"Nor is there any need for a joint 'Forestry Strategy' described in the report, which is just another term for a future forestry policy."
"The financial aid which would be allocated for this ' forestry strategy' would not benefit Scandinavia, but primarily the countries of the Mediterranean and their former colonies."
"The report prepared by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is much better than the Commission's proposal."
"In order to stop further drives by the Commission in this and similar matters, as the EU takes on more and more areas, it is best to say no."
"I have therefore voted against this report."
"I am glad to vote for this excellent report by my British Labour colleague David Thomas."
"Although I would be called in a 'townie' in Britain, and despite the fact that I represent a mainly urban constituency, I have good reason to support forestry's future."
"The Redrose Forest in my constituency is a wonderful example of the way in which forestry can help meet a variety of important needs."
"It creates jobs in an area which has suffered from industrial decline."
"It improves the environment for local people, giving them a 'green lung' and cleaner air to breathe."
"It provides a welcome new place for tourists and locals alike to visit and enjoy."
"So I welcome this report's ideas about information and awareness campaigns, to make sure everyone recognizes that forestry has a positive impact on their life - and that of the planet."
"People concerned at the destruction of forests will support the call for the EU to work for an international convention on forest protection."
"We should help developing countries to balance their need for economic growth with everyone's need to breathe!"
"Reding report (A4-0368/96)"
"My reason for abstaining in the final vote on this report is two-fold."
"Firstly, Amendment No 7 which would have explicitly respected human rights for all was rejected."
"Secondly, Amendment No 11 which was orally amended, was in contravention of the right of the presumption of innocence to all."
"I, along with all members of the House, would not condone any terrorism, whether institutional or paramilitary."
"However, we must not allow our opposition to violence to cloud our respect and protection of human rights."
"We have voted against Mrs. Reding's report."
"We are strongly opposed to terrorism and all forms of terrorist act."
"Under no circumstances could we support any movement which uses terrorism to promote its aims."
"But the problem with this report is it risks setting aside the rule of law, as several points are not sufficiently clear."
"Terrorism must be more clearly defined."
"In addition, we must clarify who will define those movements which are to be considered terrorist and which are the 'support circles' for terrorism mentioned in the report."
"The report is also aimed at not only establishing Europol but also enhancing its authority."
"We are opposed to such a development."
"Instead we feel that the well developed Interpol cooperation should be used and made more effective for the work of combating international terrorism."
"The fight against terrorism is important but it must not be used to justify a weakening of law and order in society."
"The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament vote for Mrs Reding's report, but against the request for harmonization of the penalty framework for serious offences crossing borders."
"We share the rapporteur's concern over terrorism that takes place within the European democracies, and welcome a co-ordinated approach to preventing it from occurring."
"However, we are obliged to reject the harmonization of the member states' penalty frameworks - even where there is a case of serious offences crossing borders, such as terrorism."
"The European populations have different views about the way in which their societies should be governed in terms of penalties."
"We see no reason for offending these views as a result of harmonization - especially since there is nothing to prevent us from working together in combating terrorism without common legislation on penalties."
"Terrorism cannot be accepted in a society governed by the rule of law??law governed society."
"Strong measures are needed to combat terrorism."
"It must be fought at all levels using legitimate means."
"The development of a democratic and open society is the best way of destroying the seedbeds of terrorism."
"One problem with this report is that terrorism is not defined and this could set aside the rule of law?? take law and order out of play."
"Practical and technical initiatives at airports, during baggage handling and in data and telecommunications systems must be improved."
"The cooperation between Interpol and Europol must be further developed."
"It is a mistake to assume that effectiveness is the same as supranationality."
"In my opinion, the scope for Europol's activity should not be widened to include anti terrorist activities."
"This is a matter for the individual Member States."
"Europol must not become an 'EU-FBI' ."
"With this in mind, I have voted against the report."
"Valverde L√≥pez report (A4-0396/96)"
"There are two important reasons for voting against this report."
"One is that it strongly favours increased federalism within the EU, for example point 28 which complains that the requirement for unanimity 'makes decision making difficult' , and point 32 which requires that 'applicant countries must appreciate' that the EU is 'a process of political, economic and currency unity' and point 30 which complains that certain countries are able to renounce European Court activity."
"Practically every point places the emphasis on increased supranationality within the EU."
"The other reason is that the report is clearly 'right wing' in its general political tendencies."
"For example point 9 states that national authorities must work towards the 'removal of bureaucratic and costly obstacles' for companies in order to create jobs."
"To suggest in this way, that unemployment in Europe is due to poor government support for companies is an analysis based on new liberal theories and something which we cannot support."
"The report emphasises the progress made by the Union towards the introduction of a common currency."
"It also points out the problems associated with EMU, for example, that EMU must be combined with strong mechanisms to facilitate strong cooperation in economic, social and tax areas."
"It also states categorically that unanimous decision making must be abolished in the Council."
"In view of the fact that the report wholeheartedly supports federalism as the right course of action for the European cooperation, I have voted against it."
"Escudero report (A4-0410/96)"
"We must abstain from voting on this report."
"It contains many good observations but we are unable to support some of the points."
"Point K describes the four symbols of the 'European Cultural Identity' . These are Judaism, Christianity, Hellenism and the Romans."
"But we are forgetting the whole legacy from the Muslim culture and even the Nordic-Germanic mythology and concept of justice."
"Point 1 talks about the need for the Council to abandon the requirement for unanimity in favour of the federalist requirement of a qualified majority."
"We believe that unanimity is an important protector of cultural diversity in Europe."
"In point 23, the rapporteur recommends that the Commission prepare material for schools covering the history of Europe which 'shall be introduced as an obligatory school subject in Member States' ."
"We do not believe that such propaganda measures will yield any positive results. Each country must maintain sovereignty over its own education system."
"There is no reason to use a qualified majority for matters of culture."
"If there is a European identity, it cannot be forced into being through majority decision making. This will just hinder the process."
"The structure of teaching in primary schools and the teaching material to be used are best determined at national and local level."
"School teaching and its content is not a matter for the EU. This is why I am voting against this report."
"Schmidbauer report (A4-0012/96)"
"The merit of the Commission's Green Paper lies in the fact that it opens the debate on the situation regarding transport and tackles the problem of 'external factors' (accidents, saturation, pollution, etc.)."
"I congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent work."
"She has looked at the problem overall by recommending an egalitarian approach, which is that every mode of transport should bear the external costs which it creates."
"Personally, I would also like to highlight the importance we should accord combined transport. Respecting the environment and solving congestion as it does, it represents a competitive option."
"Finally, one point remains which will excite strong reactions: the harmonisation of taxes and duties on the scale of the Union."
"In this area the Commission ought to adopt a pragmatic approach."
"I am sorry that it has not thought about public opinion."
"Increasing road tolls, for example, tends to oust lower income households from the use of major highways, and therefore from exercising a fundamental freedom: the freedom to come and go."
"On this point the Commission should give us some alternative proposals."
"The Schmidbauer report underlines the interest and the necessity of considering the negative external factors associated with transport, particularly road transport."
"Indeed the prices paid for any particular mode of transport often cover only partially the real costs associated with pollution, accidents and congestion."
"The total cost of these external factors for the whole of the European Union (250 thousand million Ecus per year) reveals the importance of the debate and what is at stake for Europe."
"This text must therefore be supported."
"Firstly for the economic stakes it induces."
"Instituting a more equitable transport pricing system means providing inducements to change the attitudes of manufacturers and users."
"This might, for example, manifest itself on the road network by the decongestion of certain areas, leading to the improvement of traffic flow making European businesses more competitive by saving time."
"Including the true cost of transport also means giving the various modes of transport an equal chance, giving them optimum conditions for competition within the Union."
"And this evolution must be taken into consideration in particular with regard to the liberalisation and the opening up of transport markets."
"Next, where economic and social cohesion are concerned, measures to integrate real costs would inevitably reorientate the investment of businesses, bringing about a diversification of modes of transport and the development of infrastructure, enabling the harmonisation and balancing out of trans-European networks."
"Finally, I think that certain measures proposed by the Green Paper, such as differentiated taxes according to fuel quality, tolls in congested and sensitive areas, etc., meet the ecological demands being made by European citizens."
"The debate must begin on the problems of the real cost of transport within the European Union."
"The Schmidbauer report can contribute to it, and that is a further reason for supporting it."
"The Danish social democrats welcome the Commission's Green Paper and Barbara Schmidbauer's report in the debate on the area of transport."
"Both the Green Paper and the report are a good contribution to the debate."
"In the EU it is necessary for 15 countries to reach unity on the political questions that arise each day."
"The transport policy is related to a whole series of other areas of policy."
"It is therefore important to reach agreement on the transport policy, though there will always be certain aspects about which one or more countries are unable to agree on."
"This report is therefore a compromise."
"Its content is of a high quality, but there are details on which further clarification is necessary."
"Thus there are parts of the report which we in Denmark cannot subscribe to immediately."
"However it is necessary to point out that this is a non-legislative measure, and taking all aspects into account, we must allow the debate free reign."
"The alternative would be for the policy to come to a stand-still, and sectors such as goods transport would not advance any further: bottlenecks and unfair competition regarding tax, energy consumption, pollution, driving hours and rest periods, etc."
"The Danish social democrats have today voted in favour of the report on fair and effective pricing in the area of transport, because it is a good report and because we strongly support the development of parameters governing competition with respect to fair competition."
"Not only between those providing transport, but also between different forms of transport."
"We agree in principle to votes 3 to 21, but we must enter reservations from the Austrian point of view regarding Recitals 15, 16 and 18, which deal primarily with the harmonization of charges intended to finance roads, because in our case the actual nature of alpine structures makes the building and maintenance of roads and motorways more costly than the European average."
"So we could only agree to harmonization for the whole of Europe - especially as regards Recitals 15, 16 and 18 - if there is a guarantee that consideration will be given to this increased burden on Austria."
"Schaffner report (A4-0001/97)"
"We, the undersigned have voted against the Schaffner report for the following reasons:"
"1.The many vague points in the Union Treaty create uncertainty in Community Law, which in practice gives the courts the right of interpretation. This would be unacceptable in a true parliamentary democracy.2.EU institutions have time after time showed a lack of respect for national sovereignty by exceeding the powers granted to them in the directives, and they continuously extend their power over national legislation without any justification.- Lambraki report (A4-0349/96)"
"We cannot support the Council decision that immigration, asylum, drugs policy, fraud, cooperation on civil law and certain forms of police cooperation shall be decided by a qualified majority."
"We believe the requirement for unanimity must remain."
"Common viewpoints arrived at through interstate agreement are a better way of resolving the issues taken up in Article K1 in the long term, than decisions adopted by a qualified majority."
"Immigration, asylum and visa policies must be better coordinated."
"This ought to happen through unanimous decisions and not by majority decision."
"Police and customs matters must naturally be interstate."
"To transfer drugs policy to EU level could lead to a worsening of the situation because the Swedish/Scandinavian restrictive drugs policy would be replaced with a more liberal policy of legalisation."
"If it became EU policy, the report would lead to a massive transfer of decision making power from the Member States to EU level."
"This is why I am voting against the report."
"Voting time is now closed."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.30 pm)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I hereby declare resumed the session of the European Parliament which was adjourned on 30 January 1997."
"Membership of Parliament"
"I must inform you that, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, I have received the resignation of Mr Bernard Tapie with effect from 4 February 1997."
"In accordance with article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, the house recognizes this vacancy and informs the Member State concerned of its existence."
"Mr Hory has the floor."
"Mr President, I should just like to speak briefly on the subject of Bernard Tapie, because what has happened to our fellow Member is, I believe, unprecedented in the history of Parliament and I should like to comment on this with a minimum of gravity."
"Bernard Tapie had given his personal undertaking to you, Mr President, and to our Committee on the Rules of Procedure, that he would resign if his criminal conviction was upheld."
"He did not want to seek refuge behind his status as Member of Parliament in order to escape the consequences of a sentence which many of us consider to be unjust."
"He honoured this undertaking and he resigned."
"But nobody, whether here in this House or among French public opinion, is in any doubt regarding the political opportunism which lay behind the legal persecution of which Bernard Tapie is the victim."
"One of our Members who is perhaps one of the least sympathetic to Mr Tapie - I am speaking of Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre - even declared on television that the French courts had been used by the political powers in order to conduct a veritable manhunt."
"This is why I should like if I may, Mr President, to say before this House - and also on behalf of the French Members of my Group - how proud I was to participate in the campaign for Europe conducted by Mr Tapie and also to express my hope of waging many other political campaigns with him in the future."
"Mr Hory, your expression of solidarity will be recorded in the Minutes at the appropriate time."
"You will understand that I allowed you to speak, even if you did not invoke any of the Rules of Procedure, as I believed that as the former Member was absent and thus unable to speak for himself, somebody should at least be allowed to say what he thought on his behalf."
"I can assure you that Parliament and all its bodies have acted with the utmost correctness in respect to our colleague."
"I must inform you that Mr Kranidiotis has been appointed Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Greek Government with effect from 3 February 1997."
"I congratulate him on his appointment."
"In accordance with article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, Parliament recognizes this vacancy."
"In the meantime the Greek authorities have informed me that Mr Kranidiotis is replaced by Mrs Anna Karamanou with effect from 6 February 1997."
"I welcome Mrs Karamanou and remind you that, by virtue of paragraph 4 of Rule 7, until such time as a Member's credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, the Member shall take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"It concerns a human rights issue which I raised in December last year and I wish a discussion on the matter under Rule 97."
"It is a question of the continued incarceration of Rois√≠n McAliskey in a Category A prison in Britain - Holloway Prison to be precise."
"There seems to be a misunderstanding between the British and German authorities."
"As I see it, the Germans have no objection to this woman being released on bail but the objection comes from the British Government - quite unnecessarily so, given the treatment this woman is receiving."
"Rois√≠n McAliskey is being kept in a Category A gaol without adequate medical care."
"She is strip-searched on every possible occasion."
"It amounts to an abuse of authority."
"I appeal for something to be done about it."
"This question is not on the agenda."
"I cannot let you discuss it further."
"I take note of what you said and this House will take the necessary steps."
"I cannot allow a debate on the question now."
"Order of business"
"The draft agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 13 February 1997, under Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"At the sitting of 13 December 1996, Parliament referred the report by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo on technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources (A4-0409/96) back to committee, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure."
"At its meeting of 20 and 21 January 1997, the Fisheries Committee appointed a new rapporteur, Mr Adam, and decided to request referral back to committee pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mrs Fraga has the floor to move the request from the Fisheries Committee."
"Mr President, all I have to say is that the Fisheries Committee did indeed decide to request referral back to committee."
"I shall now put the request from the Fisheries Committee to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Monday and Tuesday"
"I have not received any proposals for changes, but I would remind you that I already informed you on 13 February, pursuant to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, that 71 Members had tabled a motion of censure on the European Commission for its attitude in the management of the BSE crisis (B4-0056/97 /rev.2)."
"The motion of censure has been forwarded to the Commission."
"As indicated in the final draft agenda, the debate will be held at 3 p.m. tomorrow, Tuesday."
"Mrs Green has the floor."
"Mr President, just one very minor request."
"At the moment the deadline for compromise texts for the resolution on the Committee of Inquiry's report into BSE is set for 4.00 p.m. tomorrow."
"That would be before the debate and before the Commission's response had been properly heard."
"So I would ask you to see if you could delay that deadline until at least 8.30 p.m. tomorrow evening."
"I know it is very tight for your services and I apologise for that."
"But it is not appropriate for us to set the deadline for the resolution before the debate and before the President of the Commission has had an opportunity to respond."
"If you want, I would suggest keeping the deadline for tabling the joint text and amendments, but allowing changes up until the end of the debate - that is, until 8.30 p.m. tomorrow evening."
"That would provide the flexibility you mentioned, in case there are any changes as a result of the debate, and the services could go on working on the translations."
"So we will stick to the deadline, but if any changes arise from the debate, they can be introduced up to 8.30 p.m."
"Wednesday and Thursday"
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance is asking for the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled further to the oral questions on the BSE recommendations to be moved to 3 p.m. on Thursday, after the vote on the motion of censure."
"Mrs Barthet-Mayer has the floor to justify the request."
"Mr President, I should like to propose, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, an amendment to the agenda which you have just proposed."
"We would like the vote on the motions for a resolution following the Committee of Inquiry's report into BSE to come after the vote on the motion of censure tabled on this same subject."
"There are four reasons for this."
"Firstly, we consider the motion of censure we have before us to be a kind of prior question on which we must definitely vote before the vote on resolutions, insofar as it must be treated in the same way as procedural exceptions in parliamentary law."
"Secondly, on this same subject, it is traditional parliamentary practice to vote first of all on the text which departs most from the original text, or the most radical text."
"Thirdly, if the vote on motions for a resolution were to produce a majority in favour of a condemnation of the Commission's attitude in terms which are less strong than is implied by the motion of censure, the subsequent vote would by that very fact be devoid of any political significance."
"Fourthly and finally, the result of this situation would be the unfair treatment of the initiatives of certain Members and Groups. In the case of a majority adoption of a less radical resolution than a motion of censure, a minority of Members would find themselves denied this power of censure which is an absolute prerogative of Parliament."
"Mr Puerta now has the floor to speak in favour of the request."
"Mr President, I have already put the points the Group of the European Radical Alliance is making today at the Conference of Presidents."
"I know Parliament is sovereign and it can decide what it thinks fit by a majority - and we will all respect that."
"But it does not make sense, as far as European public opinion and the way we operate are concerned, to allow other factors to interfere with the motion of censure on the European Commission, a dramatic moment if you like, Mr President, when Parliament finds itself obliged to exercise its responsibility."
"There is little sense in this interference and it weakens Thursday's vote on the motion of censure."
"It could even be said that it contradicts Rule 136 of the Rules of Procedure as well as the development and consequences of the report of the committee of inquiry."
"The committee of inquiry did not take a decision to table any resolution."
"Nor did it decide to table a motion of censure."
"But in view of the gravity of the events and their impact on the health of Europeans, the completion of the internal market and the proper functioning of the democratic institutions of Europe, 71 Members of this Parliament have tabled a motion of censure."
"And that motion of censure takes priority."
"That motion of censure cannot be disrupted by a prior debate and vote on motions for resolutions."
"If we insist on working in this way, I think we will be lacking in self-respect as Members of Parliament, and in respect for what European public opinion is demanding of us."
"So on behalf of my group and the 71 Members of Parliament who have tabled the motion of censure, I put it to you, with the full agreement of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, that the voting on the motions for resolutions should take place after the vote on the motion of censure."
"In that case, if the motion of censure is unsuccessful, the Members who are tabling the motion of censure would also be able to agree with some of the resolutions established through the parliamentary policy statement."
"But we cannot allow it to be said that the motion of censure is influenced for several months afterwards by a policy resolution, when we are taking the serious responsibility of moving a motion of censure on the Commission."
"And we are conscious that if the European democratic institutions and this Parliament operated differently it would probably be possible to table a motion of censure or reprimand on the Agriculture Commissioner."
"As that is not possible, we maintain the priority of the motion of censure."
"Mr Martens now has the floor to speak against the request."
"So tomorrow, Mr President, between 3 and 3.30 p.m. we are to have a combined debate on three agenda items: the Medina report, the oral questions with debate, with a debate on the motions for resolutions, and a debate on the motion of censure tabled by Mr Happart and others."
"The great majority of the Conference of Presidents thought that we had to follow the normal voting procedure, namely Wednesday afternoon for those motions which had been put down."
"The draft agenda says that we are to vote on the motions relating to reports on which the debate has closed."
"Under Rule 34(5) of the Rules of Procedure the vote on the motion of censure must be by roll call and must not be taken until at least 48 hours after the beginning of the debate."
"The whole question, ladies and gentlemen, is whether our House can, using this procedure, hold an in-depth political debate and whether everyone can in all good conscience reach a verdict on Wednesday afternoon in the vote on the motions, and then at 3 o'clock on Thursday afternoon on the motion of censure."
"We want a full and thorough debate."
"The proposal is that the three items should be dealt with together: the Medina report, the oral questions with the motions for resolutions and the motion of censure."
"I do not think there is any question of an attempt to stop every member of the House from having a completely free vote."
"And this is why we and the great majority of the Conference of Presidents suggested that we should hold this joint debate, with a subsequent period for reflection as stipulated in our procedure, before the motions are voted on, and that after a similar but longer period for reflection as required in our Rules of Procedure we should vote on the motion of censure."
"For this reason we advocate keeping to the agenda as it stands. It does not stop us from having a free debate, it does not stop us from being free to act, nor does it stop us from having a free vote and I am thus opposed to the proposal to amend the agenda and I urge the majority of the House to approve the agenda as set by the Conference of Presidents."
"At the request of the Group of the European People's Party, I shall now put the proposal from the Group of the European Radical Alliance to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request to amend the agenda)"
"Energy Charter"
"The next item is the report (A4-0041/97) by Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion by the European Communities of the Energy Charter Treaty and of the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects (COM(95)440-12046/96 - C4-0664/96-95/0237(AVC))."
"Mr President, colleagues, the EU's dependence on imported energy is likely to increase from the present figure of 50 % to around 75 % by the year 2015."
"It is estimated that the market for energy production equipment in the EU will grow by only 1-2 % per year over the next 15 years."
"Environmental protection measures taken in the EU will have little effect unless they are also taken worldwide."
"Pollution is no respecter of boundaries."
"The Energy Charter originated in 1990 with an initiative by the Dutch Prime Minister, who believed that economic growth could be set in motion in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and accelerated by means of cooperation in the field of energy."
"The European Community and its Member States signed the European Energy Charter in The Hague in 1991."
"In 1994 a total of 50 parties signed the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol, concerning energy efficiency and related environmental aspects, to create a sound international legal basis for the principles and objectives stated in the Protocol."
"The majority of the EU Member States have already ratified the Treaty, and Finland will do so before the end of this year."
"Russia has yet to ratify it."
"The USA was involved in drafting the Treaty, but seems unlikely to sign it, which is a significant shortcoming."
"Energy efficiency and energy saving should be promoted throughout Europe."
"Particularly in Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS States, energy savings of as much as 30-40 % could be achieved."
"Western enterprises could help and advise on the introduction of new technologies, for example through the Synergy programme."
"The economic transition in Central and Eastern European countries and Russia could be facilitated by means of the Phare and Tacis programmes, and energy projects could as a result serve as a way of funding the transition."
"The Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects constitutes a good basis for more exacting environmental protection, particularly by promoting energy efficiency."
"It is therefore both positive and necessary that the Charter and Protocol endorse a policy of sustainable development, the 'polluter pays' principle and the principle of minimizing environmental problems."
"However, they do not contain any legally binding provisions on environmental protection, and this is quite clearly a shortcoming."
"When building new power stations, Eastern European countries could be expected to adhere to the same emission standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates as apply in the West."
"When it comes to overhauling old power stations, less exacting standards can be accepted."
"New projects and measures to be implemented within the framework of the Treaty must also be preceded by a compulsory Environmental Impact Assessment."
"Nuclear safety cooperation is also important."
"Difficulties in maintaining nuclear power stations have increased in Central and Eastern European countries and the CIS States, as has trafficking in plutonium."
"The EU ought - like the USA - to try to purchase weapons-grade plutonium, i.e. that which is enriched to more than 90 %."
"By mixing it with depleted uranium, one obtains nuclear fuel with a concentration of 3-4 %, which can no longer be used to make atomic bombs."
"Although at the moment nuclear weapons are being dismantled, the enriched plutonium still remains."
"Just think: in this way, nuclear power could promote world peace."
"Since the Treaty is of considerable importance, I recommend that the European Parliament gives its assent to the Council and Commission Decision to adopt, on behalf of the European Communities, the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Energy Charter is a welcome initiative."
"It is important to provide a an international legal basis for the principles of energy policy cooperation, energy efficiency and related environmental aspects."
"Far too often we have done so much too late, so that it is still hard to us today to find a common denominator."
"The Energy Charter has four important objectives: to create an open market for primary energy sources, to facilitate the transit of energy products, to promote technology transfers, which is particularly important for the Eastern European states and the CIS states, and to restrict harmful environmental effects to a minimum and take adequate account of security aspects."
"It is that aspect I am concerned with today."
"Environmental aspects are incorporated in the Energy Charter in the form of the Protocol on energy efficiency."
"I think it is good and also important that we finally have this Charter and, like my colleagues in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I can only recommend that we endorse the first implementation of the Charter Treaty."
"But what has been submitted to us is neither fish nor fowl."
"Why are energy efficiency and environmental questions regulated in a protocol, leaving aside Article 19 of the Treaty, which is not binding?"
"It is because in case of doubt the provisions of the Treaty take precedence over the Protocol."
"The wording of the Protocol is marked by diplomatic phrases which are only moderately successful in concealing its lack of substance."
"To try where possible to formulate low-cost and economically efficient energy efficiency policies and take adequate account of environmental aspects, as stated in Article 3 of the Protocol, sounds pretty weak."
"There is not one word about introducing binding legal environmental and safety standards for energy-producing plant in the Eastern European countries, at least for power stations that supply, for instance, electricity to the European Union."
"It is ironical that Austria is protesting about Mochovce while considering importing electricity from the Ukraine."
"The signatory states to the Rio convention were supposed to bring down their energy consumption to the 1990 level by the year 2005."
"We are far from achieving that."
"Then there was the idea of economizing elsewhere, in less costly areas, e.g., in the CIS or the Central and Eastern European countries."
"The greenhouse effect could be curbed effectively if the leaks in the gas pipelines between Siberia and Eastern Europe were sealed."
"Even if only 5 % of methane escapes, the greenhouse effect potential is just as great as the potential of the 95 % that remains as CO2 after incineration."
"Yet we have wasted this opportunity to lay down binding rules on technology, for instance for investments."
"While competition is given high..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) I appeal to Members to keep their eyes open and to draw the public's attention to the shortcomings of the Charter."
"We approve it because it is better than nothing, but only just."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Energy Charter is the framework of the political agreement between the countries of the east and the countries of the west, and amongst the eastern countries, the Russian Federation looms large."
"The world's great gas reserves are in Russia - in the Yamal Peninsula, in the Barents Sea, and in Siberia - and the European Union has embarked on a major programme to increase gas consumption."
"I hope the new directive governing the liberalization of the gas market will soon be before this House, and what happens in the Russian Federation is therefore of paramount importance to us."
"As other speakers have said, we are fully in support of consent to the Energy Charter Treaty and its Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects."
"We think the treaty is good although, as Mr Stockman said, the action is limited."
"In the eastern countries between 30 and 40 per cent of the energy consumed could be saved."
"That is a very great deal. The Russian Federation obtains 60 % of its foreign currency from the export of energy products and this could be greatly increased, and the western countries could also reduce consumption by 20 %."
"That would be the best policy for the environment, Mr President."
"But we talk a lot and I do not think we are doing much."
"From the environmental point of view, I consider it urgent to carry out prior environmental impact assessments and ecoauditing for all measures promoted under the Energy Treaty in the existing installations, so as to correct the massive deterioration that exists - and not in the eastern countries alone, but in our countries too."
"There are three levels to the Charter: the treaty itself, the agreements specific to three countries and the concrete measures."
"The steps I have outlined should apply to all of them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Energy Charter and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects have already been in the pipeline for quite some time."
"And now, here we are, discussing the Council proposal that empowers the Union to adopt the Treaty, and Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m's report for the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, for which my group will be voting."
"The Charter's objectives, from security of supply of energy resources for Eastern European countries to energy efficiency and environmental protection, represent aims and contextual guidelines that have won a broad consensus in the Energy Committee."
"I should, however, like to mention two remaining concerns that continue to require the Commission's attention."
"The Charter has not been signed by either the United States or Russia and, without these partners, the Treaty seems somehow incomplete, particularly as regards issues of nuclear safety in Eastern European countries - issues that the Charter could, nonetheless, help us to tackle within a cohesive framework."
"The agreement could prove to be inadequate if it fails to involve Russia, from the point of view of principles and norms, and the United States, particularly with regard to technology."
"The other concern is the effectiveness of our actions with regard to improving nuclear safety in the Central and Eastern European countries that were members of the former Soviet Union."
"The reactors in service include some that western experts consider to be intrinsically unsafe and others that require technological improvements if they are to meet adequate safety standards."
"On the basis of the norms set by the Charter, a few pilot projects should be undertaken to apply European standards to the better plants in Eastern European countries, so as to create a safety culture and work towards the definitive closure of the most unsafe installations."
"The Charter will only have visible results in the eyes of the public if the issue of nuclear safety in Eastern Europe is brought under some control."
"Mr President, the Treaty on the European Energy Charter and the protocol on energy efficiency represent a substantial contribution to a cleaner, more efficient use of energy; that is good for the environment and the Liberal Group is very much in favour of it."
"Investment in energy efficiency can best be made where the environmental benefit will be the greatest and at present that is in Central and Eastern Europe, where energy savings of 30 to 40 % can be achieved by simple means."
"Starting with the extraction and transportation of raw materials."
"Western firms can help here with expertise and advanced technology."
"The benefits are twofold: lower energy costs and a healthier environment."
"This brings me to my second point: the Ukraine, for example, is one of the least energy-efficient countries in the world."
"Energy consumption per unit of gross national product is seven times higher there than in the European Union."
"Yet two new nuclear power plants are being built with a loan from the EBRD so that Chernobyl can be closed down, and this against the advice of an independent panel of experts."
"So my question to the Commission and Mrs Wulf-Mathies is this: can the EBRD invest in new nuclear plants in the Ukraine if this is not the cheapest solution to the energy problem in that country?"
"Is one of the criteria for EBRD loans not that the solution chosen has to be the one which is economically the best and thus the cheapest?"
"Will you and the Commission, Commissioner, have the courage at last to..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, there was and still is a lot of justifiable criticism of the Energy Charter."
"Firstly, for reasons of content and then, of course, also for formal reasons."
"Parliament can only say yes or no."
"In fact we must of course admit that Parliament did not exactly make great efforts to exert any influence on it - which is regrettable and also rather shameful."
"But we must also admit that this is the first time we have ever had international legal provisions on the inclusion of environmental costs and the polluter-pays principle, even if they are not yet entirely binding."
"Previous speakers have also pointed that out."
"It is after all a small step forward, even if unfortunately these environmental aspects are only set out in the Protocol."
"I believe it is a political duty, and of course the duty of the Commission, to ensure that we come closer to the noble objectives and higher aims set out in the Charter."
"On the other hand, of course, we must say that the conditions we have at present need to be changed, namely the fact that nobody is responsible for pipelines, nobody even repairs them and everyone says, I only get five, ten or 20 per cent out of it, and that unfortunately the revenue does not go to those from whom it is taken but, especially in the case of Eastern Europe, generally lands in the hands of the mafia."
"I think our main task now is to concern ourselves a little with these matters and not just put our hand up and say yes tomorrow; for environmental considerations must not just be taken into account in energy policy but ought to become a central aspect of it."
"In the same way, energy efficiency needs to be improved and renewable energy sources must be tapped and used through better transfers of resources and framework programmes."
"And that is precisely where we as a Community are setting the worst example."
"Let me just remind you of SAVE, THERMIE, etc. I hope the Commission is listening carefully."
"At least we are making a start with implementing the noble aims set out in the Energy Charter."
"Mr President, it has taken longer to get the Energy Charter completed than its inventor, former Dutch prime minister Lubbers, ever imagined in 1990, largely because of a growing self-awareness on the part of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"With hindsight it was good that rather more time elapsed, since otherwise the Treaty would have been too advantageous to the West."
"The present text is a good compromise between the interests of the countries which produce raw materials and those which buy them."
"And yet I still have mixed feelings about this Charter."
"Obviously the Eastern Europeans are keen to sell sizeable quantities of fossil fuels."
"They sorely need currency in order to develop their own economies themselves."
"But in the long term this Charter may push energy prices down since the supply of crude petroleum and gas will become more plentiful."
"In my view this is all the more reason to tax energy as fast as possible, because low prices for fossil fuels will not favour the introduction of renewable sources!"
"In this sense the Charter is actually a piece of old-fashioned short-term thinking, despite all protestations to the contrary."
"It is a good thing that the protocol on energy efficiency has been added to the Charter, so that it can be implemented later without too much difficulty."
"It shows that thinking about energy savings has now become a commonplace."
"Like the rapporteur I have my doubts about the actual implementation of the protocol."
"Nowhere is there any compulsion to improve efficiency."
"I fully appreciate that a multilateral treaty of this kind cannot impose too many dictates, but an awful lot is left to the goodwill of the Member States."
"The environmental measures do far too little to remedy the greenhouse effect, which this Treaty will only make worse."
"Nevertheless we too endorse this Treaty."
"At least it gives some structure and legal certainty to the oil and gas trade."
"The Union will in future have to do all it can through programmes like SYNERGY and PHARE to promote energy-saving measures in Eastern Europe, because they are sorely needed."
"Mr President, I was there in Lisbon, representing Parliament when the Energy Charter Treaty was signed."
"It was clear at that time that unless these protocols were taken very seriously, we could end up with a rather dangerous situation."
"We are becoming more and more dependent upon imported fuel, and there are ample resources in the eastern part of Europe and farther afield so, clearly, we can put those two together and come up with a trading situation."
"If we just did that, however, and failed to look at energy efficiency and environmental protection, we would end up with a situation which was far worse than the present one."
"Let me say that we should, in any case, be making more use of indigenous energy sources and not relying so much upon imported fuels."
"The environmental problems have already been named: greenhouse gases - CO2 above all, but also methane, as my colleague, Mr Stockmann, has ably explained; nuclear power, where there are operational problems and, of course, problems in the disposal of waste and in the transport of fuels; and oil exploration and production which also involve dangers."
"So we need to have a worldwide environmental strategy with an impact assessment because the environment is worldwide."
"Energy efficiency has quite rightly been called the fifth fuel."
"It is, frankly, the best fuel."
"Where you have a potential 30 % to 40 % saving, which is the case in some of these countries, how absurd that this is not the first strategy, top of the list on every occasion way beyond building unnecessary nuclear reactors."
"This treaty needs tightening up."
"It is weak."
"Above all it needs monitoring."
"This is what I ask the European Parliament to take on as a duty: monitor the working of this treaty."
"Mr President, the energy situation of the countries of central and eastern Europe is such that we must think about the vital ways of monitoring the efficient use of energy resources and how they can be implemented."
"However good the proposals made officially, experience has been extremely hard and inefficiencies have been shown up - together with the harm done to people's well-being which accumulated in a socialist system where market conditions were ignored and, because there was no democracy, people's rights were not necessarily respected."
"The efficient use of energy resources must not have undesirable side effects, it must be fair and the economic effects must be positive - it is possible to have an excellent policy which avoids any undesirable side effects."
"This is a consideration which must be taken into account especially every time there is a new Commission initiative aimed at improving (rather than worsening) the energy supply situation - it does so in a dubious way vis-√†-vis the current Member States of the European Union and incorrectly, without doubt, from the viewpoint of countries which are candidates to join."
"Burdening with greater percentage targets the expenditure of families on modest incomes is both regrettable and unfair; higher energy expenditure on more antiquated equipment means damaging the competitive capacity of countries which have still not had an opportunity to modernise."
"In those countries, people's living standards is a top priority and most of the pollution in Europe (i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) has been produced by the most industrialised countries - Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France, responsible for 71.5 % of the total of the European Union's pollution, percentages much higher than their population warrant."
"Instead of burdening the budgets of those with less and impeding the development of those who lag furthest behind, the policy of the countries of central and eastern Europe should be, rather, one of monitoring legal requirements for gradually modernising domestic and industrial installations."
"By supporting this restructuring, as it has been doing, the European Union would show, without the shadow of a doubt, that it really does want to find the right solution to this problem."
"This is, after all, in keeping with the logic behind Article 130R of the Treaty, which takes into consideration the diversity of situations existing in different regions."
"Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament should give its assent to the European Energy Charter which was underwritten in The Hague in December 1991."
"The Energy Committee of the European Parliament is right to urge the European Commission to press for negotiations with a view to removing uncertainties by conferring a binding force on the protocol on nuclear safety within this Charter."
"From an Irish perspective, with the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear installations only 60 miles from our shores, it is just unacceptable that the British Government can sign up for the European Energy Charter without its own nuclear industry being obliged to comply with those provisions."
"Greater protection of the environment is, of course, important and the European Union has made a start in the right direction in this regard by finalizing the SAVE III programme which is designed to support measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere."
"A further concern indeed is the liberalization of the electricity and gas networks."
"The European and Irish consumer, as well as the individual producers have a right to know if enhanced competition will result in higher energy costs for the consumer and, of course, the employees working in the industry have the right to know how it is going to affect their jobs."
"So, the Charter should have dealt with the issue of privatization of energy resources in greater detail, outlining the protection available to the consumer who ultimately would be affected by any changes in this regard."
"Mr President, there are grave defects in the Council proposal because the environmental and energy-saving clauses are aspirational only and the Charter will provide no binding legal instruments for dealing with what are admitted on all sides to be really grave environmental degradation and pollution and seriously deficient energy-saving norms in the Eastern European states, which they show no signs of changing."
"This could turn out to be a Charter to waste energy, not save energy, and I would suggest to you that would be a very grave and dangerous outcome."
"It was particularly noticeable during the exchange of views with Ambassador Rutten and Secretary-General Schutterle of the Energy Charter Conference that instead of defending the difficulties the Union might have in implementing environmental and energy-saving provisions of the Energy Charter, they stated baldly that some Member States did not wish binding provisions for dealing with the environment in the Charter but took the view that these should be dealt with under a separate agreement."
"I believe this to be completely unacceptable as a policy for the European Union or its Member States."
"The report states that the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects provides a good basis for greater protection of the environment, especially by promoting energy efficiency, but the wording is meaningless."
"It says that we should encourage cooperation in the attainment of environmental objections and have particular regard to improving energy efficiency."
"I would suggest that in the light of the difficulties we have had with making Eastern European states understand the importance of energy efficiency, this is an absolutely meaningless document."
"The rapporteur has referred to a bizarre proposal to import weapons-grade plutonium from Russia for use in civil nuclear power plants on the basis that this would promote peace."
"I find this an astonishing proposal."
"Although it draws attention to the fact that we have an outrageous plutonium economy and that we should not be producing plutonium, I hope we can have a serious debate and discussion on the proposal at some future date."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Mr Papoutsis who is currently in Moscow let me once again explain the Commission's position on this important report."
"Let me first underline that the Commission attaches the utmost priority to the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects."
"This Treaty will only enter into force once at least 30 states have ratified it."
"At present, therefore, it is where possible applied provisionally."
"As I am sure you know, the European Energy Charter - a declaration of intent that is not legally binding - has now been signed by 51 states and by the European Community."
"Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m, the rapporteur, whom I warmly thank for her report, has described its past history."
"So I will not repeat it but just make clear that so far 49 states and the European Union have signed the Treaty that was drawn up on the basis of the political declaration of intent."
"This Energy Charter Treaty is the first economic agreement signed by all the republics of the former Soviet Union, the Central and Eastern European countries, the European Community and its 15 Member States and other OECD member countries."
"Its main purpose is to create a legal framework for long-term cooperation in the field of energy on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit."
"The Treaty contains provisions on the development, production, transit and free trade in primary energy sources and energy products, together with the protection of investment and free movement of capital."
"The Treaty and the Protocol also contain general statements about environmental aspects and improving energy efficiency."
"During the negotiations we did not manage to achieve more than what you have rightly criticized in regard to the non-binding nature of some provisions."
"Yet it is an important first step that so many states have in fact subscribed to these principles."
"Of course the Commission will be guided by the views expressed here by the European Parliament when it implements the Charter and the Treaty."
"In November the Commission submitted the communication and proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects."
"In addition to the conclusion of the Treaty itself, this proposal provides for the European Community and its Member States to deposit the ratification documents at the same time and for a simplified procedure for setting out the European Community's position at the Energy Charter conference."
"In December last year the Council agreed a consolidated wording of the decision."
"This decision is now before the European Parliament for its assent."
"Although the Commission is aware that the wording adopted by the Council differs considerably from its original proposal, it can endorse it in order to demonstrate its willingness to compromise if, as indeed seems to be the case, it is also approved by the European Parliament."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m, because her report points in precisely that direction."
"The Commission takes the view that it is politically very important for the European Community to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty as soon as possible so that the Member States can conclude and ratify it in good time."
"Nine Member States have now concluded their ratification procedures and most of the others are about to do so."
"Conclusion of the ratification procedure by the European Union and its Member States can act as a positive signal for Russia, which has indeed signed but where the ratification procedure is still under way."
"I think we can also assume that the other independent states and the Central and Eastern European states, will react to this signal."
"The Commission takes the view that the conclusion of the Treaty is very much in the Union's interest and that rapid ratification is especially important to ensure that the other parties to the Treaty and the energy industry do not lose interest in it."
"Without a shadow of doubt the Energy Charter Treaty will promote cooperation between East and West, which is in the end in the interest of us all."
"So let me ask you again to approve this decision."
"Moreover, let me briefly refer to the question put by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel: both EIB and G7 credits are being considered for projects in the Ukraine; to date, however, no decisions have been taken and the reports you described are also being taken into consideration here."
"Mr President, I have another question for the Commissioner."
"It appears that a report has been produced by a panel of experts."
"Might Parliament perhaps be given that report, since it is highly important here, and relevant to my question?"
"Please bear with me, but I do not know this report because I am merely standing in for Mr Papoutsis today."
"But I will pass on your question."
"We will then answer it in writing and tell you whether this report exists and what we will do about it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Development problems in Italy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0405/96) by Mr Podest√†, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on development problems and structural measures in Italy (C4-0050/96, C4-0051/96 and C4-0052/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the policy of economic and social cohesion and cooperation and solidarity between regions is one of the prime objectives of Union policy."
"In this context, the Structural Funds are of particular significance as an instrument for trying to reduce the serious disparities between the various regions of Europe."
"Now, the case of Italy is one of the most interesting because Italy - the third largest beneficiary of the Structural Funds, after Spain and Germany - is having some structural difficulties in using these resources."
"In the research that led to the drafting of this report, in which the concerted efforts of various colleagues were of major importance (for which I duly thank them), we tried to identify the main reasons for these difficulties as well as possible ways of making good the delay accumulated over the past few years."
"Various factors are involved, of which I shall mention only the most significant: first and foremost, obviously, the political instability that has marked the country over these past years - sufficient to say that Italy has had more than fifty governments in the fifty years since the Second World War; the fragile nature of Italy's administrative structures, both at central and, particularly, at regional level, and a certain inability to plan and implement programmes; a proliferation of decision-making centres, caused not least by the fact that, when regional government was introduced in Italy, no real provision was made for the distribution of powers and responsibilities, which has led to an overlapping of decisionmaking powers; the proliferation of sometimes contradictory legislation, with long-winded and highly complex bureaucratic procedures; the lack of coordination between Community structures and Italian central and regional structures, which has resulted in long delays in passing on information and often, I have to say, in a lack of transparency of that information; and, finally, the accumulated delay in the use of resources for the period 1989-1993 - in this respect, it is worth mentioning the possibility, offered by the agreement that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies reached with former Minister Masera, of extending to the end of 1997 the deadline for the use of funds that should have been used by the end of 1996."
"However, all of this has inevitably led to a delay in the use of resources for the subsequent period, up to 1999."
"So, why does this continue to be a difficult situation for Italy to manage?"
"In practice, Italy can be seen as two completely different countries."
"The regions of southern Italy - all of which come under Objective 1, with the exception of Abruzzi, which has only just removed itself from the list by markedly improving its situation (and here I should like to mention an amendment, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, concerning the need, in the future, to introduce transition periods) - have a very much lower rate of development than the regions of central and northern Italy, and much higher rates of unemployment."
"Among other things, we shall, tomorrow, be tabling an amendment updating the data on employment, which unfortunately show that the situation in Italy has become even more difficult."
"On the other hand, we have some data - which, unfortunately, are not yet official and which we could not, therefore, include in this report - that offer some encouragement, as they show that the use that has been made of funds over the past few months, thanks mainly to the efforts of the national and regional control centres, is beginning to improve a situation that we have to confess is still far from satisfactory."
"So, Italy's situation may not be unique in Europe but it is symptomatic of the need to make every effort - and this is the point made by the report - to shorten authorization procedures and improve coordination between Community, national and regional levels to prevent any loss of resources, which, especially in this post-Maastricht period, may be the only resources available."
"Mr President, I feel that Mr Podest√†'s report is very positive and accurate."
"That is thanks to him, of course, but also thanks to an overall working method established within the Committee on Regional Policy, for discussing and researching all cases of structural intervention in all Member States and not, of course, in Italy alone."
"There have been in-depth discussions with the Commission."
"In addition, meetings have in all cases been organized with the leaders of the Member State concerned - representatives of government, parliament, local and regional authorities and the social partners - and the same applies in the case of Italy."
"This is why we are now in a position to reach some general conclusions."
"Certainly, as regards use of the Structural Funds, Italy is lagging seriously behind, even in comparison with some other countries - and this delay is all the more worrying as it is depriving weak areas of resources and investment."
"We have to acknowledge - as the report does, and I would like to reiterate that acknowledgement - the fact that the Italian Budget Minister has given a serious undertaking to make good the delays."
"I also recently had a meeting in Brussels with the Commissioners responsible and we undertook to make good the delay by the end of this year."
"This is a difficult and ambitious objective, but it can be reached if a similar commitment is made by all ministers - by all ministers and, in particular, by all the regional and local authorities concerned."
"In particular in Italy, most of the Structural Funds, in terms of quantity, are of course concentrated in the regions covered by Objective 1, that is, in southern Italy, as has already been pointed out."
"The worst delays concern some of these regions - not all of them - but in particular the largest of them: Sicily, Campania and Apulia."
"If we can achieve results in these regions, the overall picture changes dramatically."
"We therefore need special measures, but we also need commitment on all sides, a much stronger and broader political awareness."
"We must call on Members of both the European and Italian Parliaments who represent these areas to make a special commitment in this respect."
"The special measures required are reprogramming of objectives; speeding up expenditure by regional authorities, including, where necessary, modifying and strengthening administrative structures; and also giving consideration to the possibility mentioned in the report of replacing the public agencies responsible for implementing programmes in serious cases where resources are persistently under-used."
"This is an extreme and very delicate measure that promises conflict with the agents concerned."
"But we have to ask ourselves whether a continuing failure to act would not itself promise conflict with citizens who are being denied the use of these funds and are at risk of losing them altogether."
"What, or who, is most important here?"
"Finally, I should like to point out that this issue of non-use, or of failure to make good use, of the Structural Funds is one that concerns other Member States also."
"This raises the issue of an in-depth review of the Structural Fund Regulations and of a simplification of procedures to eliminate bureaucratic delays and problems, with a view to the review of the Regulations due in 1999."
"I believe that the Committee on Regional Policy and the European Commission should work hard this year to begin to look at and review these Regulations."
"Mr President, after what the rapporteur, Mr Podest√†, and fellow Members, Mr Speciale and Mr Viola, have just said, it is difficult, not least because of the croaky voice I am suffering from today, to speak out and repeat some opinions that are commonly shared, particularly by members of the Committee on Regional Policy who have been in a position to appreciate, right from the start, the report that bears Mr Podest√†'s name, because it was drawn up by him, with the help and cooperation however of all the Committee's members."
"This cooperation was mentioned a little earlier by Mr Speciale, the Committee's excellent chairman, and I feel I need to say this publicly, because he enabled all of us to work towards a realistic and objective - since we are speaking of objectives - view of the situation."
"Because of its structure, Italy is a country that can be taken as a very valid test case for other Member States."
"So, what is the undertaking I should like to call for, seeing that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies is here with us?"
"I refer to the need for simplification - something that has been so often repeated in the Commission's statements when the Commissioner has attended meetings of the Committee on Regional Policy, that is repeated in Mr Podest√†'s report and that has been highlighted as a matter of great urgency by my fellow speakers here today. It is vital that certain procedures be simplified and that the various activities of the Commission, Member States and regions be rationalized and harmonized."
"I believe that the crucial issue goes beyond the removal of structural and cultural obstacles. I believe that what is needed, above all else, is a clear out of certain 'physical cultures' that prevail not only in individual Member States and at local level but also in some major sections of the Commission itself."
"What is needed is cultural cohesion with the Commissioner's guidelines and a common objective: the objective I mentioned earlier, which is, I assume, the central point of the report drawn up by Mr Podest√†, to whom I offer my warmest congratulations."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 and now, after forty years of European construction, we have to admit that, according to the annual report of the Court of Auditors, most of the errors concerning management of the Structural Funds can be attributed to the Member States."
"Various material and formal errors are made in compiling applications for aid, but unquestionably the greatest and most sinister error is the one committed by Member States in obstructing the desire of the regions and counties for political and administrative decentralization."
"Too often the maturity and self-management capacities of regional bodies are systematically strangled and conditioned by the centralism of the States of which they are a part, as is evident not only from the annual report of the Court of Auditors but also from relations between the regions and Parliament and from European citizens' faith in the State."
"The Italian Government's undertaking to reform the public services and simplify procedures for using the funds required for technical assistance in managing the Structural Funds is not enough."
"The more democratic and federal a State is, the more provinces, L√§nder and regions demonstrate their efficiency and ability to stand on their own two feet as regards the construction of the new Europe."
"There are many regional bodies in Europe that are sufficiently capable and mature to maintain direct relations with European structures, but are held back by the centralized organization of the State of which they are a part."
"In Italy, some regions that are fifty years old choose not to come of age, whilst others, of the same age, have obviously entered adulthood but are deprived of any independent, democratic, free initiative."
"What kind of Europe are we going to construct if this Europe, in its centralism, is a reflection of individual Member States' inability to use the resources available to them?"
"Let us all work towards ensuring that the scope of the Structural Funds is extended, that they include cultural activities in the areas coved by Objective 5b, and especially mountain regions, but, above all, let us commit ourselves to ensuring that this Europe becomes increasingly democratic and federal, comprising federal States, and that regional bodies can express themselves, in the management of the Structural Funds as elsewhere, and prove that they can do a better job than the State of which they are a part."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mr Podest√† for the clarity of his report and the research he has done on the problems concerning allocation of the Structural Funds, not only in Italy but also in other Member States."
"It is nonetheless a fact, as all my Italian colleagues here know, that the Community Structural Funds continue to be a vital resource for Italy - but, in particular, for the development of its southern regions, where unemployment has now reached close on 20 %, as is rightly mentioned in the report."
"The Structural Funds are, then, an irreplaceable instrument of European solidarity and it is precisely this solidarity that should become the basis of a European identity - without it, no integration of the Community would be possible."
"Certainly, we need to take note of the shameful delays that have so far characterized Italy's use of the Structural Funds."
"My country and therefore its governments, but also - with all due respect to Mr Moretti - incredible bureaucratic inefficiency at regional level have often led to loss of access to millions of ECUs that the Italian regions really need, be they in the north or the south, for access to these funds has been restricted in both the south and the north."
"What has emerged is a unique situation in which Italy is one of the countries that has the greatest need for funds but which makes the least use of them."
"I hope that, with the help of the contribution that Mr Podest√†'s report has made and will continue to make to this debate, both Italy and the other countries concerned will be able to overcome the problems experienced to date."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make two comments on Mr Podest√†'s full and in-depth report; they concern respectively the 'if' and 'how' of the use of the Structural Funds in Italy."
"As regards the 'if' , that is, greater efficiency and speed of use, I take up Point 6 of the motion for a resolution to specify, in the event of delays by regional governments, which alternative public agencies, including replacements, should be the protagonists of local partnerships: for example, agencies and projects involved in regional employment initiatives, which are increasingly common and effective instruments of development in the regions covered by Objective 1."
"As regards the 'how' , that is, improved planning, an amendment tabled by the Green Group and signed by me declares that regional development projects must comply with the principles of sustainable development, at both the planning and subsequent phases; the amendment also calls for the involvement of the Ministry of the Environment and nongovernmental organizations."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate Mr Podest√† on his excellent work: it was no easy task, but the result is outstanding."
"In concordance with the report, I should like to reiterate a few considerations here."
"One of the most marked differences between Italy's situation and that of its main partners is the extent and persistence of regional disparities."
"It should be possible, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, to increase the concentration and efficiency of the Structural Funds and improve the procedures for assessing and monitoring results and available funding so as to ensure that growth in underdeveloped regions is reflected in job creation and support for the process of convergence."
"If competitiveness is to be increased, more resources need to be made available for research, development and innovation."
"To encourage enterprises to use innovative technologies and develop new products, the European Union should seek a better combination of support measures for capital and enterprises, technology transfers and both initial and further education and training initiatives."
"The difficulties encountered with the use of the Structural Funds over the past few years have been, and remain, the cause of serious concern, both for us Italians and for Community institutions."
"Attempts have recently been made to tackle these difficulties by introducing some changes to Italian structures: the setting-up of the National Control Centre and the introduction of regional agreements that could serve as a significant expression of the principle of social partnership by involving the social partners, who participate at both the planning stage and the implementation stage, when they enter into binding commitments."
"In other words, what we are talking about are agreements whereby local operators, representatives of employees, enterprises and public administrations undertake to implement specific investment projects."
"The promotion of local development, by means of measures to trigger small-scale local initiatives, relating to both structures and infrastructures, or by means of aid and services for small and medium-sized enterprises, takes on ever greater importance within a properly planned regional development policy."
"This could indeed promote maximum job creation by taking full advantage of a whole series of initiatives that would, individually, generate just a few jobs but could, when combined, produce some worthwhile results for an employment region or area."
"Local development measures consist mainly, but not exclusively, of promoting what might be defined as the mobilization of initiatives, capacities and skilled human resources, to generate production systems that look towards innovation and internationalization."
"The aim of local development is, in fact, to change the attitudes underlying development strategies."
"Full advantage needs to be taken of existing structures with specific professional skills, such as the EBICs, which have been set up to stimulate the local economy in areas with potential for industrial development."
"To conclude, I feel that greater attention needs to be paid to three objectives: combating unemployment, promoting equal opportunities for men and women and improving instruments of environmental protection."
"Mr President, I, too, have greatly appreciated Mr Podest√†'s report and agree with the comments concerning Objective 2, re-industrialization, which I should like to address for a moment."
"It is my opinion that, here too, the delays suggest that the problem is an underlying one, concerning the overall mechanism and perhaps what has, over the past few years, become the modern notion of programming in Italy."
"But the fact that, in these areas, we have more concentrated interventions, albeit with fewer funds and, all in all, a method - reindustrialization - that goes hand-in-hand with an existing economic, productive and administrative fabric, should lead us to expect that the delays can be made good more quickly."
"Having said this, however, it is my opinion that this experience of Objective 2, which has been a real and very important experiment, not only in Italy, and which has brought the public and private sectors face to face and thrown up new ideas concerning long-term planning, has aspects that we need to address from a critical viewpoint in the reform of the Structural Funds."
"I should also like briefly to mention two priorities referred to in the report: firstly, as regards local initiatives, an issue that some of my colleagues here have already addressed, I should like to point out that development requires an alternative culture, a culture of monitoring and promotion, rather than a culture of official control and authorization."
"Just two more points: urban actions and policy for mountain areas."
"Under Objective 2, it has often happened that actions cease at district boundaries."
"It has been important to set this limit, but I believe that this points to the need for an organic urban policy and - and the report mentions this briefly - a policy for mountain areas."
"Objective 5b perhaps suggests that, instead of implementing a combination of interventions, we need, in future, to concentrate on limited but significant action for mountain areas, not just in Italy but throughout Europe."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate our colleague, Mr Podesta, for his excellent work on what is a particularly sensitive subject for him, as indeed it would be for any of us if we had to assess the impact of structural assistance in our own country."
"The European Union's Structural Funds were set up in order to promote lasting economic and social development."
"The record of their implementation has been the subject of much criticism, in particular due to the obstacles and delays in the utilization of aid."
"But the most striking feature about Italy is that it continues to show extremely deep-rooted regional disparities."
"I therefore consider it essential for the European Union to keep up its efforts to ensure balanced development throughout Italy."
"The imperfect use of funds does not mean there is no need, but much more generally that the means for obtaining and using the available resources are inappropriate."
"It sees to me unacceptable that we have not yet envisaged any system for regions who lose their eligibility under one of the Structural Fund objectives."
"As what will prove to be the precedent of the Abbruzes case shows, there is no provision for compensation in order to lessen the shock of a sudden discontinuation of structural aid."
"Other regions risk finding themselves in precisely the same situation in the near future."
"Are they then going to see all their efforts which permitted the beginnings of economic recovery come to nothing?"
"Without seeking to indefinitely maintain economically vulnerable regions dependent upon financial assistance, I believe it would be irresponsible not to create a transitional support device for these regions."
"Failing this, we will soon be forced to accept that the structural measures applied today are a waste of money as the least sign of economic life in a region is likely to result in the cutting off of structural assistance as soon as the planning period ends."
"The example of the Abbruzes must lead us to quickly look at what measures can be implemented in order to fill the legal vacuum which surrounds the abrupt termination of a region's eligibility under the Structural Fund objectives."
"We must therefore find a solution before 1999, in the framework of the next Structural Fund review."
"The urgency of the matter has been amply demonstrated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Podest√†, on his skill in dealing with the problems relating to the structural funds measures."
"I will not analyse the specific issues, because I think those who have spoken before me have done so very accurately."
"I will just refer to some general points which I think it is interesting for us to consider."
"One is the concern Mr Podest√† has mentioned about the future of the structural funds and the need for the European Union to determine this when the funds are reviewed in 1999."
"We note with concern that the gap between the more developed regions and the less developed regions of the European Union, far from narrowing, is tending to increase."
"So the problem of applying the structural funds will continue to be important in the future."
"Another disturbing issue is the fact that resources have been lost through faulty application of these funds."
"In this respect, I believe priority must be given to bringing the structural funds regulations into line with the aim of applying them more effectively."
"And finally, I want to highlight the need for these structural funds to be adequate and coordinated with other programmes, MEDA for example, specifically affecting the southern Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I want to give warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Podest√†, and to the committees concerned for their detailed and thorough analysis."
"The Commission shares their concern about the inadequate use made of the structural funds and largely agrees with the measures you proposed for making them more effective."
"As you know, in July 1995 the Commission negotiated a comprehensive package of measures with the Italian government in order to improve the management of the structural fund programmes."
"Among others, this package provides for the creation of new administrative structures, for tightening up the procedures, for practical support measures and improving the skills of the programme managers, more efficient procedures for monitoring, controlling and assessing the programmes and simplified procedures for transfers of resources to the organizations responsible."
"It should also be pointed out once again that all the Italian regions also approved this package of measures in September 1995. I explained it to them all at the time."
"For the rest, we made this programme and these proposals as simple as we possibly could, but control and correct financial management are essential and I think it is in all our interests not to end up with difficulties here."
"At my most recent meeting with the Italian minister of finance, Mr Ciampi, on 20 January, our talks focused on assessing what has been achieved so far."
"The situation as regards implementing the programmes in the Objective 1 regions has improved in relation to the figures for last May given in the report."
"At present the payments to the final recipients account for more than 14 % of the total amount, compared with 7.7 % in May 1996."
"So there was a clear acceleration of payments here."
"Compared with other Member States, Italy is, however, still very much offside, because the EU average is about 35 %."
"But once again we must make it clear that this cannot be due just to the complexity of the Commission procedures."
"Because of the lack of progress in situ, ECU 1600 million could still not be allocated and we all agreed during the discussions that this situation has to change."
"That is why the Commission has once again agreed with the Italian authorities that new expenditure targets have to be set."
"Unused resources from programmes that do not achieve these expenditure targets will be deducted and used mainly to finance more successful programmes."
"But let me make it quite clear that this does not necessarily mean that in the end we do not also transfer resources to other regions, in the event that no improvements become apparent after a fairly long time in certain regions."
"This should induce everyone actually to do something to ensure that the people at whom these programmes are aimed finally benefit from them."
"With this procedure the Commission has also introduced the measures you recommended to prevent further losses of Community resources."
"The Commission hopes these measures will have a positive effect even in the course of this year and it will carry out the evaluation you called for during the 1998 financial year on the basis of these measures."
"Moreover, I have agreed with Minister Ciampi on regular checks of the practical implementation of the July agreement, at both technical and political level."
"This applies both to the actual fulfilment of the reform undertakings and to monitoring whether the financial objectives have been attained."
"And I would appeal to you: let us not create new structures now but let these new proposals and the cabina di regia finally become operative at all levels."
"That is our problem: in theory and on paper we now have a very sensible system, but we need the people to apply it and to support it."
"In the case of the new Objective 2 programmes, we have already embarked on radical corrections with the Italian government and I hope that this will be of some help in future too."
"We have also made progress in involving the economic and social partners, both in the framework of the 1995 agreement and in relation to the new Objective 2 programmes."
"I hope this will also be of help in terms of future developments."
"We have also accepted your call, Mr Podest√†, for greater emphasis to be put on the economic potential in the cultural sector and have incorporated this aspect in the cooperation with the Italian authorities, for it is quite clear that Italy is particularly well placed to use this economic potential."
"The structural funds offer Italy a unique opportunity, with a view to economic and monetary union, to make progress with budgetary consolidation, without disregarding forward-looking investment."
"I can only appeal to all those responsible to seize this opportunity."
"The Commission, at any rate, will continue to use all its energies to urge that the resources finally go to the places where they are needed most urgently and we continue to hope for your active support."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Development problems in Germany"
"The next item is the report (A4-0002/97) by Mr Botz, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on development problems and structural assistance in Germany in the period 1994-1999 (C4-0047/96, C4-0048/96, C40049/96, C4-0673/96, C4-0674/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, reading the titles of the reports on the agenda today one could be tempted to think these are merely routine matters."
"But let me begin by briefly explaining why this is anything but a routine matter in the case of Germany."
"German unity, which was only possible with the assent of the Member States of what was then the European Community, has given us Germans the chance to see what belongs together come together again, as a former Member of this House, Willy Brandt, put it in 1989."
"Primarily this is of course a German task, but it is also a European one, at least insofar as when the former GDR was very rapidly integrated in our common single market, it was - and I want to emphasize that strongly - the first region of the former Central and Eastern Europe planned economies to do so."
"That has created a completely new situation for one of the most prosperous Member States of the European Union, Germany."
"Until 1990 there were very major structural differences outside the German borders between regions in this internal market, today we have extremely serious differences within the German borders in relation to gross product and prosperity."
"By accepting this challenge to create cohesion within its borders Germany is also taking on a European responsibility."
"That is why concentrated support from the European structural funds in the new Federal L√§nder was, is and will remain necessary and is very gratefully received by the people concerned."
"Let me just say briefly, over the period 1994-1999 this involved a total of ECU 13 640 million."
"European Union support in what are called the old Federal L√§nder, the territory of the former German Federal Republic, is equally necessary and logical. There it goes to Objective 2 and 5b regions."
"Over that same period, this involved a total of ECU 2 820 million."
"Let me now briefly list and address a few of the major development problems that occur in all the target regions, meaning all the German target regions."
"The administrative procedures at Commission, Federal and Land level need to be speeded up."
"If I may make a personal remark, we tend rather often to hear the different levels apportioning the blame for this, but rather more rarely to hear practical proposals for solutions."
"In view of the disturbing trend of the German labour market - I need not quote you the figures here - we must try to adapt the existing aid measures in as simple a manner as possible, which in principle is already possible through the regulation."
"In this context, the regional economic and social partners must be involved more closely in the activities of the supporting committees."
"Some Federal L√§nder are doing so in exemplary fashion."
"But there are other Federal L√§nder, in particular among the new ones, where more effort needs to be made here."
"It is vital for local employment and development agencies to play a larger role with a view to reducing the current rise in mass unemployment."
"The procedures for disbursing the resources must become much more transparent, and I say this as an urgent warning to the German authorities, in particular the Land authorities."
"The interim financing in the regions which is often still necessary should be avoided in future."
"In view of the widely known budgetary situation, there is a need for action here too."
"Allow me briefly to address a major problem in the Objective 1 area, where I am personally involved too."
"Let me point out quite clearly that we are dealing with the consequences of structural upheavals which have meant that nearly everything has changed for nearly everyone in nearly every area of life."
"This has also created certain psychological problems, which should not be disregarded."
"To conclude, let me point out that the European Union's structural funds are a vital means of building up the new Federal L√§nder and will have to remain so for a long time to come."
"In view of the increasingly complex economic and social situation, they must become more flexible and be used more flexibly for Germany too."
"All those involved at Federal, Land and Commission level, but here in Parliament too, must make their contribution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Germany is the second strongest country in the EU and the second largest recipient of resources from the European structural funds."
"And that is despite the fact that Germany is supposed to be and indeed is one of the strongest countries in the European Union."
"The explanation is that the European Union is paying attention to the situation in Germany and, as the rapporteur Gerhard Botz just said, is giving massive support to the new L√§nder."
"But the European Union is also assuming responsibility for the weaker regions in the old Federal L√§nder."
"It is important to note that, for as Europeans we want to pay attention to the regions, to regional differences."
"In Germany the European Union is assisting what are regarded as the fallen giants in Objective 2 regions."
"These are the industrial regions that have to overcome problems for which they need our support because they are engaged in structural adjustment measures; they were the motive force in Europe for many decades and they therefore deserve our support."
"Secondly, the European Union is also assisting the rural regions, which are quite different from the industrial ones because they have to tackle different problems, namely the lack of infrastructure and also the fact that the European agricultural policy creates difficulties for them."
"In terms of disbursement of the structural fund resources, Germany is unfortunately no paragon."
"In 1995 only 21 % of the funds earmarked for Objective 2 regions were disbursed."
"In the case of Objective 5b regions, the figure was only 51 %."
"So opportunities were missed, opportunities to promote development but also opportunities to bring the people closer to Europe by making it clear to them that Europe is looking after them too."
"In the near future we will monitor the disbursement of the funds more practically, critically and promptly in the committee and at every opportunity, so that we really can make more progress with using the funds in Germany too."
"We know that the application procedures are to be improved and in view of the further development of the structural funds we should take what the regional representatives have said very seriously, in relation also to the findings of Gerhard Botz's report."
"We must try when we further develop the structural funds to simplify them, to concentrate them, to strengthen partnership and avoid duplicated assistance, and in particular to ensure transparency, so that the people can see on the spot what is happening with the European resources."
"We must no longer allow resources to be pocketed without it being made clear that the European Union is assuming responsibility for all those people in Europe who live in regions that need assistance."
"European assistance in Germany can stand up to scrutiny."
"We support it entirely."
"Of course we will continue to point to the problem areas and try to bring about improvements where these are necessary."
"We fully and entirely support the outstanding report by my friend Gerhard Botz."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group let me first acknowledge and express my appreciation for the common efforts made by Germany and the European Union towards the economic recovery of the new Federal L√§nder and the successful contribution of the structural funds towards improving the situation in German Objective 2 and 5b regions, as the rapporteur also did so well in his report."
"For the future too we regard the structural funds as an essential expression of European solidarity with the disadvantaged regions of Germany."
"This report is a mid-term evaluation of the development problems and structural fund measures."
"It is up to Parliament and the Commission to draw conclusions from it for the next programming period."
"Let me list a few of these conclusions and also of the experiences drawn from current practice."
"The current procedure for drawing up EU assistance plans and operational programmes and for implementing these programmes does not make nearly full use of the possibilities for simplification provided for in the regulation."
"For instance, in 1994 the Commission did not permit a uniform programming document to be drawn up."
"Instead it insisted on what are called multi-fund programmes, which unnecessarily increased the administrative procedures for implementing the operational programmes."
"At the same time, as a result of constantly increasing and changed requirements in relation to evaluating, reporting, etc., the administrative statistical procedures have also increased sharply. The Commission interprets the respective regulations very broadly - or at least this is what was constantly confirmed in practice."
"Other major problems are the legal uncertainties, which result in different interpretations of various assistance aspects, such as final recipients of the assistance, costs eligible for assistance and so forth, together with the rules on actual expenditure, which create a considerable and unnecessary burden for undertakings and local authorities who have to pre-finance the costs."
"That really is the crunch."
"Transparent and unambiguous rules with clearly demarcated figures need to be adopted, which also take due account of the budget laws of the individual Member States and make specific provision for advance payments."
"Commissioner, the new structural fund regulations must restrict the type of indicators required to the respective assistance objectives."
"They must expand the rights and responsibilities of the Member States in administering the EU resources and they must widen the powers of the flanking committees and not make their decisions subject to additional confirmation by the Commission."
"The economic effects of the assistance and their acceptance by the economy and the regions could be measurably and considerably improved by these proposed measures, without incurring any extra expenditure."
"I believe that Mr Botz's report offers a good point of departure for this."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Mr Botz, I think you have produced a splendid report on the structural funds position in Germany, which is an obligation for Germany - as you yourself said so well - and an obligation for Europe."
"These funds have to cope with the problem of the new L√§nder as regards infrastructure, not to mention everything corresponding to their application for environmental improvements and, above all, for the creation of employment and hence major support for small and medium-sized firms, which can best generate employment in those territories."
"You have highlighted two important points in your report which could also be applied to other States."
"The first is the importance of involving the social partners in decision-making, application and monitoring of the structural funds."
"The second, equally important, relates to direct participation by the L√§nder authorities: they are the best placed to ensure more effective application of the structural funds, in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there have been some changes in the nature of structural assistance since the Delors White Paper, which enshrined the concept of 'sustainable development' ."
"Delors also made it clear that basically regional development must be interpreted more broadly."
"More emphasis was accordingly laid on environmental protection and the using structural change as a means of creating new jobs."
"Germany wasted this development opportunity."
"There they rake in EU resources and pass them on to the L√§nder via the instrument of Community assistance, following the economic policy model of the 1950s."
"Yes, esteemed colleagues, you have understood me correctly."
"In Germany the structural funds cannot be used for the same broad spectrum of assistance as has been customary throughout Europe since 1994."
"The main victims of this are the five new L√§nder and because they have no financial reserves they have to rely mainly on what they can assist jointly with the Federal Government."
"But the small and medium-sized undertakings have also suffered, which is why so far there are no SMUs in the new L√§nder, even though assistance has been going on for a long time."
"We cannot just let this continue unchecked and should aim now at decisive changes."
"I would ask you to that end to support the amendments tabled by the Greens in the European Parliament."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all Mr Botz rightly says in his good report that rising unemployed is the biggest social problem facing the united Germany."
"But real unemployment is far higher in the new Federal German L√§nder in particular than the statistics suggest."
"The European Union and the Federal German Republic have certainly used the European structural fund resources successfully to improve the situation in the Objective 1 regions in the new Federal L√§nder and the Objective 2 and 5b regions in the old Federal L√§nder, although unfortunately there were considerable delays in the latter case, Commissioner."
"It is essential to avoid such delays in future!"
"It is not easy to achieve the aims of creating and protecting jobs in the new Federal L√§nder, although ECU 13 640 million have been planned for 1994-1999."
"In the Objective 2 regions, ECU 1 590 million are also to be set aside for the economic and social restructuring of industrially backward regions."
"The lion's share of ECU 1 130 million goes to NorthRhine Westphalia and Berlin."
"Lesser amounts go to states, for instance c."
"ECU 32 million to Bavaria."
"Instead they will receive ECU 1 230 in Objective 5b assistance."
"This assistance is very important for the rural regions, especially in states such as Bavaria and Lower Saxony, for instance to enable them to tap new agricultural income sources, create new jobs and to promote training and further training."
"Commissioner, at this point I would like to address your plans for concentrating and improving the efficiency of the structural funds after 1999."
"In the event that Objective 5b assistance really is abolished, it is vital for rural development and assistance measures to continue, otherwise we will risk a further flight from the land and an unhealthy growth of conurbations."
"At the same time, you want to assist the environment, which is damaged by this kind of trend."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament and of the Commission and the Council, when you continue with the development of the structural funds, do not forget to assist the rural areas and the people who live in them!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that the Botz report gives an objective picture and a critical view of the development problems and structural measures in Germany over the period 1994 to 1999."
"Commissioner, I think it was a good idea for this report to be submitted during the first half of the reference period because that can enable us to deal with the problems that have been identified during our further handling of the structural funds and thus make effective use of the remaining time to promote structural development in Germany."
"What are the crucial points in the Botz report?"
"We must seek to improve the coordination between the various funds."
"That means that the consultation and service capacities have to be expanded to make it easier to identify potential assistance areas."
"Furthermore, in my view it also means that in future we should concentrate on fewer but more effective programmes and press ahead with them."
"The application procedures have to be simplified."
"And here, Commissioner, we are fully and entirely in agreement with our Italian colleagues."
"After all, we cannot continue having advisory offices in order to help us find our way through the bureaucratic European application procedures."
"In their own interests the regions must be more closely involved in the decision-making processes."
"This applies in particular to the pilot projects, for which only 1 % of structural fund resources are available but which involve a lengthy and costly application procedure and in the end are not authorized for lack of resources."
"We must make Europe more visible, more comprehensible."
"The structural funds make a splendid contribution to the adaptation of the European regions."
"Major differences exist between individual regions in Germany too."
"I would wish, indeed I would demand that all European resources that go to the regions are also clearly recorded as such and shown in figures."
"Following the German saying 'Do good and tell about it' , this would give the European Union a better image and reputation in the regions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes Mr Botz's comprehensive and balanced report and I hope that we will be able to translate most of its findings into practice."
"The shock of the labour market situation in Germany, but also the very serious economic break-ups in East Germany make it very clear why the Federal Republic comes second only to Spain and Italy in terms of overall assistance from the structural funds."
"As a number of Members have pointed out, this fact is unfortunately too little known in Germany itself, which is why I can only support your efforts in that direction."
"For the rest, it is not just a question of making friendly gestures but also of the Federal Government and the Federal L√§nder in question publishing details of structural fund participation."
"Between 1991 and 1993, the structural funds helped create and preserve more than 220 000 jobs in East Germany and I hope the figure will be even larger not just in East Germany but in Germany as a whole over the current assistance period."
"Let me also point out that the European resources that go to Germany are not just a continuous and calculable source of finance but are also a tangible expression of European solidarity."
"So I welcome the fact that the report takes a most positive view of this contribution from the European structural funds both to Objective 1 regions and to improving the situation in the German Objective 2 and 5b areas."
"The Commission broadly endorses the conclusions in the report regarding the development problems and confirms the priorities it set, jointly with the Member States, for the period until 1999: namely combatting unemployment, the environment and sustainable development, improving competitiveness - especially in the case of SMUs - and equal opportunities."
"They have been clearly defined in the Commission's guidelines for the new programming period 1997-1999 for Objective 2 areas and these projects have proven themselves, as the new German programming plans show: the Commission has accepted six out of nine programmes on principle since the end of January."
"In saying this I also want to make it clear that this time we are deciding the programmes early in 1997 and that we have effectively countered the criticisms that have been made about delays here."
"For the rest we intend to submit similar guidelines for the mid-term review of Objective 1 areas."
"I think we should use this forthcoming mid-term review to take critical stock of the situation, for I believe we should regard the dramatic decline in growth of Objective 1 areas, i.e., in East Germany, and the rise in unemployment as a reason to check all the planned measures once again in terms of their effectiveness and, where necessary, to adjust the programmes accordingly."
"Mr Botz, in your report you address a widespread concern in the new Federal L√§nder in noting that the first green shoots of economic recovery in 'regions of hope' must not be jeopardized by a premature reduction in support rates."
"Let me therefore point out, and with reference not just to the East German regions, that firstly, we must guarantee solidarity with the poorer L√§nder and regions in future too and secondly, even if they achieve the GDP targets, which unfortunately is unlikely to be the case in East Germany in the short term, we should avoid any sudden breaks in assistance."
"Abruzzi, which was referred to earlier, is in fact quite a good example of slow phasing-out, rather than the reverse."
"I think we should look at the situation in practical terms."
"I also want to make it clear here that we will not forget the rural areas when we review the structural funds."
"As you rightly pointed out, Mr Botz, one of the most important tasks for the new generation of programmes is to simplify the implementing and financing procedures."
"There are certainly areas here where improvements are needed."
"But let me also point out, and recently I have undertaken a number of trips round the various regions, that the East German Federal L√§nder now regard the EU instruments as more flexible and targeted than the German 'joint scheme' ."
"Perhaps we should draw a lesson from this that we do not only need major changes in the Commission and that there is in fact some reason to believe that we can all achieve improvements through cooperation and partnership, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle."
"For the rest I hope that the SEM 2000 procedure concerning eligibility for assistance will bring some relief even in the short term."
"On the question of evaluation, I know this subject keeps being brought up."
"The German Federal audit board criticized the fact that the German aid instruments contain almost no target projection, no quantified objectives and no rational evaluations, and I think this explains why the Germans groan so much about the European requirements."
"But I believe that if more account was taken in Germany of the Court of Auditors and its reservations we would also find evaluation easier."
"I would also point out that Member States' budgetary laws are far more complex and less flexible than the European Union legislation."
"For instance, as you know, they do not have the transfers of resources we have under European law and which are a particular advantage to backward regions."
"And when you consider that the majority of resources are based on advance payments and only the last 20 % depend on the measures actually being taken, I do believe this is a very generous system."
"I hope you are taking note that the interest that has meanwhile accumulated in Bonn also benefits the regions."
"Let me just point out again that of course we cannot say on the one hand that we want strict controls, that we want sound financial management, while on the other hand we just keep paying advances and do not make sure that in the end the measures really have been carried out and carefully executed."
"I believe this procedure allows for great flexibility and I would wish to see it presented as being as transparent as it actually is."
"Let me conclude with two pieces of good news."
"Firstly, at the end of 1996 the payments backlog in the new Federal L√§nder was basically made up and the only remaining delays are with Objective 2 and 5 programmes."
"These delays do indeed exist, but here gain we have a good chance of making them up."
"That applies in particular to Objective 2."
"Secondly, we have made substantial progress with establishing the principle of partnership, and I hope this will make the programmes more effective and lead the regions to identify more closely with their EU programmes."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Cohesion policy and the enviroment"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0360/96) by Mr Hatzidakis on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission communication on cohesion policy and the environment (COM(95)0509 - C40141/96)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I am privileged to present to you today deals with Community cohesion policy and the environment."
"It relates to the Commission communication on the subject - which, I must say, is a very good document - and examines the effects which the Union's policies to promote economic and social cohesion are having, and may have, on the environment in the Member States and regions which are the recipients of assistance."
"The quality of the environment has a direct bearing on the quality of our lives and should therefore be a matter of continuing concern to us."
"The degradation of the environment which has already occurred poses great dangers."
"As I say in my report, the Union's cohesion policies can actually have a prejudicial effect on the environment in some cases."
"All necessary measures must therefore be taken to eliminate these adverse effects and to harmonize the cohesion policies with the goal of environmental conservation."
"We have to find the golden mean via which the cohesion policies can in themselves contribute to the fostering of sustainability."
"It should be understood, also, that development and environmental protection are not necessarily mutually incompatible, as was believed in the past and as many still believe, but that they can actually complement each other."
"A good environment is often a main prerequisite for development."
"A region blessed with good environmental conditions is certainly more attractive to investors than one with a damaged environment."
"For example, cleaning up beaches and setting up a biological purification plant in a tourist area, particularly in the regions in the south of the Union at which the cohesion policies are principally aimed, not only benefits the environment of the area but also makes it more attractive for tourists and therefore contributes to its development."
"In order to achieve these objectives, however, the cohesion policies need to be changed and reformed in a number of ways."
"I list the requirements in my explanatory statement, and I will mention a few of them quickly now."
"Firstly, it is essential to boost the environmental dimension at every level of the planning and implementation of the Union's cohesion policy."
"This can be achieved through increasing the appropriations for the environment, improving the quality of environmental projects and creating the potential for purely environmental Community initiatives."
"Secondly, as regards the Cohesion Fund, which, as you know, finances actions in the transport and environmental sectors, the distribution ratio of 50 %: 50 %, which so far, despite the clear improvements in relation to the past, has not been fully respected, must be strictly observed."
"The greater emphasis should be placed on promoting the most environmentally-friendly solutions, by giving priority, for example, unlike at present, to railways over roads."
"As far as the environment is concerned, support should be given for actions which are more directly environmental, such as afforestation and the combating of desertification in the Mediterranean area."
"Thirdly, the particularly important institution of the environmental impact assessment needs to be reformed. Assessments are carried out at present, of course, but their effectiveness is very questionable."
"They must take place before the project is approved and be carried out by persons who are independent of the contractors, and they must be binding."
"Fourthly, it would be helpful if the Commission could initiate a study to find a widely accepted methodology for measuring the possible environmental impacts of projects and actions."
"Fifthly, there is a need for an improvement in the functioning of the monitoring committees. This must, of course, be pursued in close cooperation with the Member States in order to avoid undermining the principle of subsidiarity."
"It would be a good thing, furthermore, if a body of environmental monitors were to be established at Community or national level."
"This body would monitor compliance with the environmental conditions on a continuous basis and be able to impose fines or other penalties in the event of violations in accordance with 'the polluter pays' principle."
"Sixthly, an important role can be played by the broad range of undertakings known collectively as eco-businesses - the great majority of which are small and medium-sized - which engage in such activities as pollution control, the production of new, energy-saving technologies and the provision of services for waste management and reduction."
"Here we have a good example of the combination of the agreeable with the beneficial: environmental protection and also the fostering of development through the support of small and medium-sized enterprises which create permanent jobs."
"Lastly, assistance should be provided for environmentally-friendly activities, such as eco-tourism."
"I would like to thank all those who contributed to the completion of this report with useful observations, proposals and amendments."
"In its final form, as presented to the House, it satisfies me almost completely."
"I have tabled only two amendments, one of which is purely technical and the other a more substantive formulation of a particular point."
"In finishing I wish to say that I hope that the conclusions of this report are taken seriously by the Commission and, most importantly, that they can be discussed in the framework of the impending reform of the structural funds."
"The Community's cohesion policies must in future be made even more environmentally-friendly. As I said at the beginning, we all of us have to grasp that development and environmental protection are not mutually incompatible objectives but, rather, that they can complement each other, and that, indeed, they must complement each other in order for development to be sustainable."
"Madam President, the House has seen the opinion of the Environment Committee so there is no need for me to repeat everything that it says. I would just like to say a few words in connection with three or four of the points that are mentioned in it."
"I believe, firstly, that we need to move more purposefully towards a policy of serious and responsible pricing of natural resources. These resources are often used wastefully."
"I think, in particular, of water and energy resources."
"Green taxes could help, but, unfortunately, there seems to be very little progress in that direction."
"The second point that I feel obliged to mention, without elaborating, is the need for integration of the objectives of sustainable development with the common agricultural policy."
"A third point, and one that we feel merits particular attention, is the need to make sure that national selection of environmental programmes is not distorted by political or electoral pressures."
"The Commission will have to exercise more control in this regard and start to impose sanctions at some juncture."
"It is not acceptable, for example, to select Pharaonic projects involving the diversion of rivers when water-saving and small projects would be more beneficial."
"Another point is nature conservation."
"We think that too little attention has been paid to investment in terms of nature maintenance and protection."
"Here one sometimes finds baffling violations: environmental investments supported from the Cohesion Fund, such as biological purification plants, which actually damage the environment because they are constructed in woodland, and therefore necessitate the felling of trees, or on beautiful pieces of coastline or even in vulnerable biotopes."
"I could give examples of such projects in Greece and elsewhere."
"The integration of sustainable development objectives into routine policy practice will be promoted very substantially if the very interesting report provided for us by the committee and the arguments adduced by Mr Hatzidakis, which we endorse, stimulate action on these points."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the budgetary authority our House has shown, with what is called the greening of the budget, how much importance it attaches to environmental policy within the Union's expenditure policy."
"Of course this applies very much to structural and cohesion policy, especially in view of the fact that many of our citizens fear that the Union uses their taxes first and foremost for onesided industrialization and that this tax revenue is then used to repair and remedy the environmental damage this has caused."
"The very good report by Mr Hatzidakis now before us also leads one to suspect that the Commission is still not taking this disquiet felt by the people seriously enough."
"There is no other way to interpret the lack of meaningful and in particular comparable data on the percentage shares of expenditure on the environment."
"I believe that as Members of Parliament we must be particularly concerned to have transparent data on expenditure before us and to be able to check it accordingly."
"Moreover, we must emphasize that, as stated by the rapporteur, there is still an imbalance between transport infrastructure projects and environmental projects."
"We expect the Commission to take rapid, concrete action as a means of emphasizing the importance it attaches in cohesion policy to its projects, which are right as such, in the field of environmental expenditure."
"We know that in the medium term too there will of course be a need for action here after 1999."
"The social democrats in this House support the report and congratulate the rapporteur again on his detailed and good work."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication on cohesion policy and the environment, the Commission presents a detailed and illustrated overview of the factors necessary for achieving complementarity between cohesion policy and environment policy, a complementarity which presupposes that development has the least possible impact on the environment and that both can go hand in hand in harmony."
"First of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report analyzing the measures necessary to obtain that harmony."
"As Mr Hatzidakis rightly points out, the strategic objective is sustainable development."
"However, we still have a long way to go in applying cohesion to achieve truly sustainable development, even though progress has certainly been considerable."
"In fact, in implementing the programmes, the Commission concentrates priority action on the environment in terms of legislation and regulations."
"However, as the rapporteur points out in his report, considerable efforts are needed and progress must be made on evaluation and control of the programmes, both before they take place and afterwards."
"The Commission recognized this in the seventh annual report on the structural funds in 1995, when it stated that it remains necessary to improve both evaluation and environmental monitoring of the programmes."
"As regards the 'cohesion countries' , the same report notes that the Commission is concentrating on water management measures and efforts should be geared towards another type of measure which promotes respect for the environment, because there is a danger that areas as important as nature conservation will be left to one side."
"Still relating to the 'cohesion countries' , we support Mr Hatzidakis' thesis on transfer of technical resources and knowhow from the most developed Member States to the least developed, within the framework of the Union's cohesion policies, because that can have a positive effect on the environment of those countries."
"And finally, mention must be made of the primordial role the local and regional authorities need to play, because their participation in the decision-making process and the management of the programmes must inevitably be increased to achieve greater efficiency, as the environmental impact is most obvious at local and regional level and that is where the most direct work on sustainable development can be done."
"Madam President, I agree that the Hatzidakis report is an excellent one, but for the Commissioner's benefit I should say that two years ago we had more or less this self-same debate in Parliament and singularly little has improved since then."
"We need to realize that a clean environment makes a region more attractive to inward investment."
"So spending out of European funds to improve the environment frequently proves economically beneficial - this should really be the basis of the cohesion policy."
"We note in Mr Hatzidakis' report, but in the opinion delivered by the Environment Committee too, that this cohesion policy is responsible for a lot of environmental damage in the European Union; that is unacceptable and it violates the Treaty."
"We have to improve environmental impact assessment and make it more accessible to those concerned."
"That means that the programmes too must be the subject of environmental impact assessments."
"I refer you to paragraph 12 of the resolution."
"In this way the principle of prevention can at last be properly applied."
"Lastly, Madam President, there must be greater concern under the cohesion policy for protection of the natural world."
"Too much environmental spending is still going to projects concerned with so-called water infrastructure."
"And that is detrimental to nature."
"Madam President, we want action from the Commission so that we do not have to keep on asking it for the same things."
"Let us see the Commission buckling down to the task so that we do not have to repeat ourselves next year."
"Madam President, the Hatzidakis report contains a number of important recommendations for the Commission's future structural policy."
"Regional aid goes back a pretty long way in Europe."
"Its objective was always purely economic."
"In other words, it was geared to increasing growth, restructuring economies and narrowing the gap between levels of prosperity in the Community."
"All of these were very worthy aims but they had one serious handicap: they took hardly any account of damage to natural values or the environment."
"Provided there was growth, all was well."
"But things are now changing, albeit in dribs and drabs."
"It is good that DG XVI has announced that the link between cohesion and environment will be made clearer."
"But the Hatzidakis report reveals that this announcement has one major shortcoming; it is not specific enough."
"What exactly is the Commission going to do to now to establish economic cohesion in a sustainable manner?"
"That is the billion-dollar question."
